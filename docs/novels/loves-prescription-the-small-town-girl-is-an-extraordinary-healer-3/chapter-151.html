                <p>The moment lsaac wheeled himself out of the interrogation room, the opposite door to the waiting area swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes locked instantly, Verena and Isaac holding each other&#39;s gaze for a quiet second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile curved Verena&#39;s lips as she asked, &#34;Were you frightened by it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief spread through lsaac as he noticed her calm expression, untouched by fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a small shake of his head and said, &#34;No, I&#39;m alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the two headed toward the exit, the sight stirred Danica and Bobby, who quickly rose from their seats in the lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby rushed toward them, turning to Waldo with worry written all over his face. &#34;Officer Collins,what about Verena?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo cast a glance at Danica before he answered Bobby firmly, &#34;There isn&#39;t sufficient evidence to tie  Verena to the crime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer made Bobby smack his hands together in triumph. &#34;See? I knew it! Verena would never do such a thing. If you ask me, Katelyn&#39;s lost her mind. She&#39;s jealous that Isaac chose someone else,so she&#39;s trying to pin it all on Verena!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s initial shock at Waldo&#39;s words quickly softened into relief, and her shoulders eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips pressed into a thin smile as she turned to Verena. &#34;I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not knowing what else to say, she grabbed Bobby&#39;s arm and tugged him toward the exit. &#34;Since it&#39;s settled,let&#39;s go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Bobby had been eager to talk with Isaac and Verena a little longer, he ended up being dragged away by Danica.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were back at Seraphina Villas, Isaac made his way straight into the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting before the tall window, he dialed Stevie&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s about time!&#34; Stevie teased the moment he picked up. &#34;Are you finally treating me to a good meal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smirk crossed Isaac&#39;s face as he answered,  &#34;Haven&#39;t you already had your fill scamming free dinners off Leonardo and the rest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pretending to be outraged, Stevie exclaimed, &#34;You&#39;re too sharp! Leonardo and I just finished eating, and we&#39;re heading to the pool hall now. Care to join us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac replied, &#34;Go ahead and enjoy yourselves. I won&#39;t be tagging along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat of silence passed before he added, &#34;Stevie,I&#39;m calling because I need your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stevie chuckled warmly on the other end. &#34;Come on,with our friendship, you don&#39;t even have to ask. Just tell me what you need done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gazing out through the glass, Isaac said in a cold voice,&#34;The surveillance on Wood Street was tampered with the morning of December first. You&#39;ve always been the expert when it comes to this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he left the thought unfinished, Stevie caught on right away. &#34;Say no more. I&#39;ll handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet &#34;Thanks&#34; slipped from Isaac&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, he turned his wheelchair and began rolling toward the master bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right as he reached the doorway, Verena&#39;s laughter carried through. &#34;Ivan, do you have a moment?&#34; The response that followed was smooth and teasing &#34;For you, my sweet Verena, I&#39;ll always be free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of a man&#39;s voice made lsaac freeze in place, instinctively lowering the noise of his own movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words &#34;my sweet Verena&#34; made Verena shiver with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tongue clicked against her teeth as she said,&#34;Could you please drop that nickname?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man,instead of backing down,leaned into it with playful stubbornness. &#34;Absolutely not. &#39;MMy sweet Verena&#39; fits perfectly. How could I call you anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though her patience wore thin, she eventually broke into a laugh at his shameless persistence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caller, Ivan Calderon, was a young man from Akoitha whom Verena had saved in Clokron three years ago. Having grown up without parents, he had come to see her as the older sister he never had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With striking features and a voice smooth as honey,Ivan exuded effortless charm. His reputation among friends,however, was that of a mischievous flirt who rarely treated life with seriousness. Verena shook her head with a smile. &#34;Enough with the jokes. I need to talk about something important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delight spread across Ivan&#39;s face as he exclaimed,&#34;Finally, something worthwhile. Ever since you left,I&#39;ve been drowning in boredom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a light laugh. &#34;This task will suit you better than anyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew lvan&#39;s reputation-his talet in hacking was unmatched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of putting his skills to use filled him with energy. &#34;Perfect! At last, I have something exciting to do!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calmly, Verena continued, &#34;What I need is for you to repair the surveillance on a particular street. I&#39;ll message you the location.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan let out a confident chuckle. &#34;That&#39;s nothing for me. Consider it done, my sweet Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She returned his grin and said, &#34;I&#39;m grateful,lvan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dramatic click of his tongue, Ivan teased,&#34;Grateful? After everything we&#39;ve been through, those words sound like an insult to the bond we once shared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mischief carried through every word, and Verena  couldn&#39;t help but laugh openly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their conversation drifted for a few more moments before they decided to end the video call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the line went silent, the room felt still, though Isaac hadn&#39;t moved from the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lashes lowered as unease curled through him. That man had called her &#34;my sweet Verena.&#34; What connection did they share? Just how close were they?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a memory struck him-Verena had spoken the name Ivan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan. The initial &#34;I&#34;. The same letter inked beneath her collarbone. Could it really mean him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s thoughts wouldn&#39;t quiet, and the longer he lingered on them, the sharper the ache that pierced his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The armrests of his wheelchair bore the weight of his grip as he swallowed down the bitterness and rolled himself forward into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of movement made Verena glance over her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her eyes landed on Isaac, she knelt in front of him and asked gently, &#34;Were you frightened when the police summoned you so suddenly today?&#34; It was the identical question she had posed to him earlier at the station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering at once, Isaac lowered his gaze,studying her with an intensity that looked almost like he was lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to repeat herself, he finally broke the silence and said slowly,&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her instinct was to comfort him, but lsaac lifted his hand first, brushing his fingertips across her cheek.&#34;Because I was scared something might happen to you,&#34;he admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, Verena looked startled, and then she smiled softly and pressed her hand over his.&#34;You don&#39;t have to worry. I&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The brightness of her eyes pressed down onhim,and even though they were clear, he found himself unable to read what she truly felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac tightened his lips, pretending he hadn&#39;t caught the voice of the man she had spoken with on the phone earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remarked, &#34;There&#39;s no need to trouble yourself about this. I&#39;ve already arranged for someone to repair the surveillance on that street.&#34; With a shake of her head, Verena answered in a lighter tone, &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary. I&#39;ve already asked a friend to take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word stung Isaac&#39;s throat. A friend? What kind of friend used such tender words, especially a man?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He forced down the bitterness long enough and asked,&#34;Can you really trust your friend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Assuming Isaac&#39;s concern was only about competence,Verena gave a confident nod. &#34;Of course. He&#39;s the one I trust most.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The edge of the armrest dug into Isaac&#39;s palm as his fingers curled tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It struck him then that he was still not the person she reached for first when trouble arose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On their wedding day, it had been Miranda. Now,once again,it was someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he fought to keep control, the weight inside his chest made his eyes burn red despite his silence.</p>
