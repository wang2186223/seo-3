                <p>After a moment, Verena broke the silence, her voice soft but sincere. &#34;I wanted to thank you again for helping me earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon blinked, momentarily thrown off. It took him a second to recall the incident with Luis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of how he almost exposed his connections to Luis sent a faint pang through him,but he quickly masked it with a smile. &#34;It&#39;s nothing. Friends and colleagues look out for each other, don&#39;t they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stole a quick glance at him, but his calm expression betrayed no sign of trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had expected something more, some sign of discomfort, but he remained utterly calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for a book on the nearby shelf, Verena flipped it open, her fingers brushing the pages with an absent sort of grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon, content with the quiet, said nothing more either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence in the archive room was broken only by  the soft rustling of pages, making the stillness even more noticeable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze drifted back to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was standing with her head slightly bowed,her hair tied neatly, fingers delicately turning each page as if lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sunlight filtered in through the window, bathing her in a warm glow. Her long lashes cast faint shadows under her eyes, and the pale pink of her lips almost beckoned him closer. Her skin seemed to shimmer,glowing softly in thelight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s breath quickened, and his heart thudded loudly,echoing in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There she was, the woman he had dreamed about for so long,standing just feet away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An intense,unspoken longing burned in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to hold her, to let the emotions he had buried deep inside burst free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With each passing thought, his hatred for lsaac deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had taken what should have been his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was the one who had claimed the life, the love,  that was rightfully his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did Isaac always get to take what he wanted with such ease, while Simon was left in the shadows,struggling for a chance?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The solution was simple in Simon&#39;s mind: eliminate Isaac,and Verena would be his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stillness lingered between them before Verena&#39;s casual voice broke through. &#34;How old are you, by the way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her question cut through Simon&#39;s swirling thoughts,pulling him back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to face her, his gaze faltering just for a moment before he answered, his voice steady,&#34;Twenty-six.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of surprise crossed Verena&#39;s face. &#34;So young?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Moss, you&#39;ve already achieved so much at your age.Your girlfriend must be amazing as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, Simon&#39;s eyes dulled, and he shook his head. &#34;I don&#39;t have a girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena leaned forward slightly, her curiosity piqued.&#34;Oh? Haven&#39;t met anyone who caught your eye?&#34; Simon stared at her for a beat, his silence speaking volumes before he finally replied,&#34;There is someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head, intrigued. &#34;What&#39;s she like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze never wavered from hers. &#34;She&#39;s beautiful.Brilliant. Kind-hearted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes softened. &#34;Does she feel the same way about you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp ache twisted inside Simon. His grip tightened on the book in his hands, and the bitter sting of unspoken emotions surged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Isaac weren&#39;t standing in his way, Verena might have fallen in love with him by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words slipped from his mouth through gritted teeth, laced with a hint of desperation. &#34;She will.Eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were as much a promise to himself as they were to Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena sensed the underlying turmoil in his eyes.Before she could press further, Simon&#39;s voice cut through the silence. &#34;I&#39;ve gathered the materials,Evelyn.I&#39;ll head out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he turned and left the room, leaving Verena standing in the quiet, her mind racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small frown tugged at her lips. Simon was a master at hiding his feelings. This attempt to probe felt far too shallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed she would need to take a bolder approach...</p>
