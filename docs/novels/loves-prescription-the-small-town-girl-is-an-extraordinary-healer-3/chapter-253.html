                <p>Despite Luis&#39; words, the challenge in his eyes was plain to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac let out a cold sneer. &#34;Mr. Sampson, your polished phrases sound impressive, but I know my people and what they&#39;re capable of. You deliberately waved fat salaries in front of them. Do you think I&#39;m oblivious to your intention?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, Luis and he had walked their paths without conflict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now, out of nowhere, Luis had chosen to set himself against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard to believe there wasn&#39;t something hidden in the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; smile slowly faded as he straightened in his chair,his gaze hardeninglike steel. &#34;Mr. Bennett, since you prefer honesty, I&#39;ll be direct. The strong always rise to the top. I&#39;m only gathering talent for my own cause. If you take that as a declaration of war... so be it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words landed with the weight of a loaded pistol,cocked and ready. The two men locked eyes, and silence thickened between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac frowned, his gaze sharpening into a cold blade,pressing down with invisible force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis lifted his chin, meeting that icy glare with composure, though a sinister edge lurked beneath his calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meal wound down, leaving behind an unspoken clash that hung heavy in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis picked up a napkin, dabbing at the corner of his lips. His sharp gaze slid to Isaac, a faint smile tugging at his mouth. &#34;Mr. Bennett, thank you for the hospitality. This meal was entertaining. I wonder when fate will allow us to drink and talk again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s lips curved ever so slightly as he replied,&#34;Whenever the thought strikes you, I&#39;ll be ready,Mr.Sampson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each phrase carried meanings deeper than the surface.Luis chuckled, shook his head lightly, and rose.&#34;Then I&#39;ll take my leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac inclined his head, his voice low and steady. &#34;Take care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his chin, eyes following Luis until the man  vanished beyond the private room door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Isaac&#39;s expression harden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis was clearly determined to oppose him to the bitter end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what gain could he possibly hope for by crossing the Bennett family?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What,in truth,was his purpose?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the restaurant, the driver spotted Luis and quickly swung open the rear door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis slipped inside, and the car rolled slowly down the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned against the seat with a studied laziness,eyes closed, though his brows furrowed faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His assistant hesitated before speaking. &#34;Mr.Sampson,are you truly set on opposing Isaac? Challenging the Bennett family in Shoildon is like rowing against the tide-risky and unwise. Isaac&#39;s standing in the business world is formidable. You should think carefully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis kept his eyes closed, his voice low, calm, almost dismissive. &#34;It&#39;s only a smokescreen-to keep him guessing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant frowned, clearly/ puzzled. &#34;Sir, I still  don&#39;t understand...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis opened his eyes slowly, a fierce light flashing through the narrow gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone turned cold. &#34;Simon used my sister as leverage, forcing me into conflict with Isaac. But why would I drag both of us into ruin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, fists tightening unconsciously, veins swelling on the backs of his hands. &#34;Simon is vile.Once I find my sister, he will answer for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, he bowed to Simon&#39;s demands, if only to protect his sister&#39;s life-until he could secure her safety with his own hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Bennett Group, the conference room doors swung open as Isaac wheeled himself out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob,waiting nearby,stepped forward with a file in hand, bowing slightly. &#34;Mr. Bennett, the investigation into Luis has yielded results.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lifted his gaze, motioning him to go on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob cleared his throat and scanned the report.&#34;Since arriving in Shoildon, Luis has kept a low profile.Other than a few dinners with business leaders, there is little worth noting.&#34; He hesitated before adding, &#34;However, the very day he arrived, he met with Simon Moss....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s hands on the wheelchair froze, a mocking smile curling his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So-that was the thread tying Luis&#39; every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw no need for further probing. This alone was enough to prove there was an unseen bargain between Luis and Simon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in his office, lsaac reached for the phone without delay, dialing Verena&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the call connected, he spoke with urgency. &#34;Verena, Jacob&#39;s investigation confirmed it -Luis and Simon are connected. Their arrival in Shoildon is far from coincidence. I suspect they&#39;ve been in league all along. Simon is certainly not what he pretends to be. You must guard yourself at the hospital. Better still-dismiss him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was taut with worry, his brows drawn deep in concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of such a threat near Verena was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Verena was briefly startled but quickly steadied herself. &#34;Isaac, I understand your  fears. But to drive him away now would be like alarming the snake before striking. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll deal with him in my own way. Besides, I still have things to uncover.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to confirm if Simon was in fact Carl, and if he had harmed her grandmother and Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Isaac&#39;s unease lingered, his brow locked in a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the enemy lurking in shadows, Verena&#39;s safety was not something he could gamble with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, he said firmly, &#34;Then I&#39;ll arrange bodyguards at the hospital. Verena, don&#39;t refuse me this-it&#39;s vital you remain safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the anxiety in his voice, Verena softened with a smile. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll listen to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a knock echoed at Isaac&#39;s office door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up to see his secretary waiting, report in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to send her away, but Verena,having overheard, said gently, &#34;It seems you&#39;re busy. I won&#39;t keep you. Go on with your work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac frowned faintly but gave in, lowering his voice.&#34;Very well. We&#39;ll talk later.&#34; Sensing his reluctance, Verena reassured him with a warm smile. &#34;I&#39;ll come pick you up in three hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, his eyes brightened, and a rare smile spread across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call ended, Verena&#39;s expression grew solemn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pondered for a moment, and then searched her contacts and dialed an international number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call was answered swiftly, and Verena spoke clearly. &#34;Hello, Dr. Joyce? This is Evelyn. I need your help with something. Are you available now?&#34;</p>
