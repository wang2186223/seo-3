            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. Go finish your work,&#34; Kaia said, her words clipped and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the servant disappeared down the hall, her restraint shattered. Fists tightening in midair, she swept the stack of files off Verena&#39;s desk without even glancing at them, the papers scattering as she stormed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She returned to the ground floor living room still wearing the same hard expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura had just wrapped up chatting with a group of guests when she spotted Kaia&#39;s look. Concern etched her face as she crossed the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand rested lightly on Kaia&#39;s cheek. &#34;Sweetheart, is something bothering you? You don&#39;t seem like yourself.Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t sickness draining the color from Kaia&#39;s face-it was the heat of her anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her teeth pressed into her lower lip as she forced the emotion down, but her eyes began to glisten,reddening until they looked ready to spill over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as expected, the sight of her in that state threw Laura off balance. &#34;Honey, what happened? Did someone give you trouble? Just say the word and I&#39;ll take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small sniffle escaped as Kaia answered in a trembling voice, &#34;No one&#39;s bullying me, Mom. I&#39;m just... really disappointed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Disappointed?&#34; Laura asked, brows knitting. &#34;About what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in a steadying breath, Kaia lowered her voice.&#34;It&#39;s my eighteenth birthday. I was so happy, because for the first time, my friends and the whole family were here to celebrate. I went upstairs to bring Verena down so we could cut the cake together, but-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest was carried away by a tear that finally broke free. Laura&#39;s mouth tightened. &#34;So? She refused to come?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s head moved slowly from side to side. &#34;I knocked, but no one answered. When I opened the door... she wasn&#39;t even there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s frown grew more pronounced, and Kaia pressed her teeth into her lip, doing her best to mask the quiet hint of triumph tugging at her mouth. Her tone turned soft and uncertain. &#34;It&#39;s my eighteenth birthday,a huge milestone for me, bout Verena didn&#39;t even show up. Mom... do you think she can&#39;t stand me? Did I mess up so badly she&#39;s going out of her way to stay away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears slid down her cheeks, completing the picture of wounded innocence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight made Laura&#39;s heart ache, and she pulled Kaia into her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, sweetheart, of course not. You&#39;re wonderful-anyone would like you. This isn&#39;t about you. It&#39;s Verena&#39;s fault. She grew up in a backwater place and still hasn&#39;t adjusted to city life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in their quiet corner, a few guests glanced over at the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s hand stroked Kaia&#39;s shoulder. &#34;Don&#39;t cry, people are watching. Go and mingle with the guests. I&#39;ll talk to Verena myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick dab at her eyes, Kaia nodded. &#34;Alright, Mom. But please don&#39;t be too hard on her. Maybe...maybe something more important came up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That hint of generosity softened Laura&#39;s expression, though it sharpened her annoyance toward Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s tone sharpened with irritation as she spoke. &#34;She&#39;s got nothing going on all day,so what could possibly matter more than showing up for your eighteenth birthday?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia caught the look on Laura&#39;s face and knew Verena was in fora scolding. The sting from her earlier setback began to fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few more soft words between them, Kaia straightened her posture and returned to the party, her smile back in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she was gone, Laura stepped outside to the quiet of the backyard, pulling her phone from her pocket to make a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out on the road, Verena glanced at her ringing phone, the caller ID confirming exactly what conversation was waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Verena picked up, Laura&#39;s voice came fast and sharp. &#34;Where are you? It&#39;s Kaia&#39;s eighteenth birthday. Why aren&#39;t you here? Get back right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one hand steady on the wheel, Verena gave a quiet, amused chuckle. &#34;Can you explain why I&#39;m supposed to care about Kaia&#39;s birthday party?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer nearly made Laura snap-Verena had never been one to obey her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s your sister! How can you act like it has nothing to do with you? It&#39;s not often we&#39;re all together for Kaia&#39;s birthday, and you just slipped away like it didn&#39;t matter. What&#39;s going on with you? Do you really need a personal invitation before you&#39;ll bother to come?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena let out a cold, disdainful scoff at that. So this was what Laura called a family celebration? The truth was laughable. All Laura wanted was to parade her around like some prized token-to show everyone that the Willis family had opened their arms to the girl raised far from privilege. That kind of story, if told the right way,would polish the family name like nothing else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exposing Laura&#39;s motives wasn&#39;t worth the effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp laugh escaped Verena&#39;s lips before she spoke. &#34;So now you remember me because it&#39;s Kaia&#39;s eighteenth birthday. Funny, because where were you when it was mine? Where was the family then? Or did I stop counting as family back then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura went quiet. A flicker of guilt pricked at her, but it was gone almost as quickly as it came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had a clear sense of what was running through Laura&#39;s mind, but she also knew that any flicker of guilt would fade quickly, especially with Kaia and Luka nearby, soaking up all her affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s voice turned cold. &#34;I told you before, stop bothering me. What I said before was a threat,and I mean it. Keep pestering me over these petty things, and I&#39;Il make sure you don&#39;t get anything you&#39;re after.&#34; Verena ended the call without waiting for a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s words left Laura frozen, too shocked to form a response. It wasn&#39;t until the dull,mechanical tone buzzed in her ear that the full weight of Verena&#39;s rudeness hit her. That tone, that attitude-who did she think she was, speaking to her like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white, her face clouded with fury. I it weren&#39;t for the party already underway and guests mingling throughout the place, she would&#39;ve ordered someone to haul Verena back for a proper scolding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, barely a mninute after ending the call, Verena&#39;s phone lit up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Expecting Laura to continue her tirade, she glanced at the screen and saw a different name-Barrie Lyons,a former patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered without hesitation, &#34;Mr. Lyons, what&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reply came in an older, slightly hoarse voice. &#34;Dr. Willis, are you still overseas?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not,&#34; Verena responded plainly. &#34;I&#39;m back. In Shoildon, actually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s excellent news. I&#39;m in Shoildon too,&#34; Barrie replied, the relief clear in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasted no time getting to the point. &#34;The old problem with my right leg started acting up again. The pain hit so hard earlier I almost lost consciousness. I had a doctor come to the house, but nothing he did made a difference. I&#39;ve finished the medicaton you prescribed. If it&#39;s not too much trouble, would you be able to come by?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had no real obligations that evening. She simply needed to breathe away from the suffocating atmosphere of the Willis Villa. So availability wasn&#39;t the problem. And when it came to her own patients, she never hesitated-no matter the hour, she always made it a priority to reach them as soon as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; she said. &#34;Send me your address, and I&#39;ll head over now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrie dictated the location, and Verena keyed it into her GPS.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her foot pressed harder on the gas, the car picking up speed.</p>
