                <p>in one strike. That&#39;s how you win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened, picked up a bowl of porridge from the bedside table, and held it out. &#34;Eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s glare hardened. She slapped the hand away,her voice like ice. &#34;I don&#39;t need your kindness. Don&#39;t think I can&#39;t see through you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The porridge splattered slightly, lukewarm and sticky against Katelyn&#39;s skin, leaving a faint mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered, she set the bowl aside, calmly wiping her fingers with a tissue. &#34;Oh? Then why don&#39;t you explain what you think I&#39;m after?&#34; she asked with a slow, deliberate ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia scoffed, &#34;You&#39;re not fooling mne. You&#39;re trying to use me as your pawn against Verena-just another step to get close to lsaac. Do you really take me for an idiot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in Shoildon already whispered about Katelyn&#39;s obsession with Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia, having grown up in the city, was well aware of it. Katelyn folded her arms, her smile twisting into something sharper as she looked down at Kaia.&#34;Smart lady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was praise in words only-the scorn behind it was clear as glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re laughing at me for being foolish. Fine,I&#39;ll admit it-I&#39;m not clever,&#34; Kaia admitted,her lips twitching with stubborn defiance. &#34;But after losing to Verena again and again, do you really think I&#39;d be dumb enough to challenge her outright? She&#39;s got Isaac behind her now, and even the CEO of AuroraNexus in her corner. You don&#39;t cross people like that. I won&#39;t, and neither will you. Otherwise,why bother with me at all instead of striking at her yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn didn&#39;t flinch at the accusation. Calm and composed, she shook her head. &#34;You&#39;re half right.I do intend to use you against Verena, but not because I fear her. I can&#39;t afford to let lsaac suspect I&#39;m moving against her. Do you want to know why you&#39;ve lost to her every time?&#34; Kaia clenched her jaw, saying nothing. With a smirk,Katelyn added, &#34;Because your tricks were sloppy.Every scheme y/ou tried was transparent, easy for Verena to dismantle. If you&#39;d taken the time to plan properly, you wouldn&#39;t have fallen so hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s tone stayed flat. &#34;Maybe so. But it doesn&#39;t change the fact that I&#39;m finished. I&#39;m no match for her, and I&#39;ll never bring her down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning closer, Katelyn&#39;s eyes gleamed. &#34;So you&#39;ll just accept defeat? If you work with me, I&#39;ll give you resources, guidance, everything you need. I&#39;ll make sure Verena never forces you to bow your head again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conviction in Katelyn&#39;s words carried weight, and against her will, Kaia felt a spark of temptation. She hated her failures, hated Verena even more.Yet even with the offer dangling before her, doubt still gnawed at her-because facing Verena again seemed impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s eyes narrowed on Katelyn, suspicion and hesitation warring inside her. At last, her defenses slipped, and she asked quietly, &#34;What exactly can you give me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question told Katelyn all she needed to know-Kaia was wavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slid onto the bed beside her, closing the gap,her voice dropping to a coaxing murmur. &#34;You&#39;ve always idolized Evelyn, haven&#39;t you? The miracle doctor everyone praises, admired at home and abroad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name alone sent a spark through Kaia&#39;s dull gaze, her hopelessness cracking into sudden light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not missing a beat, Katelyn leaned in, feeding that spark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But being her fan isn&#39;t enough. You should stand at her side as her apprentice. Learn everything she knows. Become greater than her. Then crush Verena in her own field. Strip away her glory. And when the time comes, I&#39;ll help you topple her support from Isaac and the AuroraNexus CEO.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word rolled off Katelyn&#39;s tongue like a spell, weaving possibility into Kaia&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in ages, Kaia felt her pulse quicken with something close to hope, as if Evelyn might walk into the room any second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The despair weighing her down gave way to burning desire. She wanted more than survival now-she wanted to rise as the most renowned doctor alive,praised by the elite. She wanted the Bennett family to choke on their arrogance, Alec and Laura to drown in regret, and Verena-oh, especially Verena-to kneel before her and beg for mercy in front of the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought consumed Kaia until she could no longer hold back. She seized Katelyn&#39;s arm, her voice trembling with excitement. &#34;You can really take me to Evelyn? You can truly make that happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s lips curved into a knowing smile.′′Of course. I don&#39;t make promises I can&#39;t keep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Kaia tried to rein in her eagerness, forcing a sliver of doubt into her tone. &#34;But why should I believe you? You claim to know Evelyn-but do you?Don&#39;t think you can trick me. Our professor has met Evelyn, so l&#39;d know if you were lying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn tilted her head, a soft &#34;Oh?&#34; escaping her,her voice touched with curiosity. &#34;And which professor would that be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Professor Wendell Branson,&#34; Kaia answered firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the name, Katelyn&#39;s gaze dropped for a brief moment, the corner of her mouth twitching as she etched it into memory. Wendel Branson. Good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she knew exactly who had contact with Evelyn.Mixing fact with fabrication was her art, and a mere professor was hardly an obstacle she couldn&#39;t bend to her advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her eyes again, Katelyn&#39;s voice rang with confidence. &#34;I&#39;d never stoop to lying to you, Kaia. Not about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia, seeing no flicker of dishonesty in Katelyn&#39;s face, pushed further. &#34;Really? Then tell me-where is Evelyn now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s lips curved as her eyes narrowed, a sly gleam flashing before she answered, &#34;Right in front of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words jolted Kaia. She stared at Katelyn in disbelief, her voice rising. &#34;You&#39;re saying you&#39;re Evelyn? Don&#39;t be ridiculous. Evelyn&#39;s a man!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unshaken, Katelyn held her gaze, her smile calm and unnervingly confident. &#34;And what makes you so certain? Who ever told you Evelyn was male? Have you seen a single report confirmingit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia faltered. In truth, she hadn&#39;t. There had never been a clear account of Evelyn&#39;s identity-only vague descriptions. Her own admiration had led her to imagine Evelyn as some refined, scholarly man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaia,&#34; Katelyn called out smoothly, leaning in as if sealing the claim. &#34;Believe me. I am Evelyn. The world calls Evelyn a legendary phy/sician for good reason. Some say I live in seclusion, others whisper about mystery-but none of that erases the fact that I&#39;ve healed countless patients and built a reputation recognized everywhere. Why would I risk telling a lie so easy to expose?&#34;</p>
