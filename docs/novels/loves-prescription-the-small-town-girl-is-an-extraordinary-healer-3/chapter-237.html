                <p>After finishing dinner at a restaurant, neither Isaac nor Verena felt like lingering there any longer.They went home soon after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at Seraphina Villas, both got swept up in work,typing away in silence. Isaac eventually slipped off to the bathroom for a shower,leaving Verena alone with her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat at the desk, barely moving,the glow from her laptop casting shadows across her face. Isaac&#39;s earlier words kept looping in her mind, a jumble of doubts and half-formed suspicions making it impossible to focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving up, Verena shut her laptop softly, rose to her feet, and shuffled over to the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips pressed into a thin line as she folded her arms tighter across her chest. The city lights glittered before her, yet her eyes held no interest in the view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind kept circling back to the unsettling news she&#39;d received earlier that day, refusing to let it go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the doctor she had recently hired wasn&#39;t the real  Simon after all, then who exactly was stepping into that role?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question sparked a memory of her conversation with lvan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Ivan was right, then Carl had feelings for her during his time as a patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d disappeared soon after leaving the hospital,vanishing like smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible he&#39;d resurfaced with a new face and a new name? Could he have slipped back into her world just to get close to her again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he knew she and Isaac had feelings for each other, and to stop them from being together,Carl used her grandmother to distract her while he went after Isaac himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of it was nothing more than a swirling storm of guesses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sorting out whether Simon and Carl were the same person would take more than hunches-Verena knew she had to be patient, to watch and wait until the truth revealed itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts kept circling back to her grandmother&#39;s death,which had happened not long after Carl left the hospital. Still, another puzzle nagged at her. Simon and Carl barely shared any resemblance...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With arms locked across her chest, Verena stared out into the night. There was no warmth left in her gaze;all that remained was a cold determination that refused to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Simon really was Carl, if he&#39;d gone so far as to reinvent himself just to get close, then Verena knew he was the one behind her grandmother&#39;s death-and the reason Isaac had been hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She promised herself she wouldn&#39;t let him escape justice when the truth finally surfaced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she stood at the window, her mind miles away,everything around her faded into the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac came out of the bathroom, spotting her silhouette against the city lights. Quietly, herolled across the floor and stopped beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his head up, studying her distant stare.Understanding flickered in his eyes, mingling with quiet affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stayed fixed on the view, completely unaware that Isaac was so close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle touch, he slipped his hand into hers. Her  fingers felt ice cold against his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small frown appeared on his face. &#34;Your hands are like ice. You need to dress warmer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wrapped both of his hands around hers, letting his warmth seep into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The contact finally snapped Verena out of her reverie.She turned, searching lsaac&#39;s face for words she couldn&#39;t quite form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t pry, just smiled and said softly,&#34;It&#39;s late.We should get some sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried easily through the hush of the evening,warm and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fatigue tugged at her, and she managed a soft smile.&#34;Yeah,I think I need it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When morning arrived, sunlight filled the dining room with a golden glow. Verena and Isaac sat at the table,breakfast nearly finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena finished the last bite of her meal, Isaac slid a glass of warm milk in front of her. His voice was low and caring. &#34;Don&#39;t forget your milk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took the glass, beaming. Her voice turned gentle as she replied, &#34;Thanks, honey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time she called him that, Isaac felt a spark inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how many times he heard it, the word always seemed to mean more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile played on his lips as he watched Verena, his eyes filled with a softness reserved only for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a slow sip of milk, the creamy line left behind catching Isaac&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in, his touch light as he brushed away the milk from the corner of her mouth with his thumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s face lit up at his gesture, her lips curving into a bright,playful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s heart skipped. There was a new sweetness in her that made him want to close the distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to help himself, he reached for her chin,drawing her closer as he moved in for a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could, Verena&#39;s hand pressed gently to his chest, her eyes sparkling with mischief. &#34;Not so fast -someone might be watching,&#34; she whispered, tilting her head toward Rhonda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda, catching on, quietly disappeared into the  kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac caught sight of the rosy flush on Verena&#39;s cheeks and paused, his grin softening into something even warmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was rare to see her blush from shyness, and he found it charming every time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in and pressed a gentle kiss to her cheek,lingering for a heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their quiet moment was interrupted by the ring of Isaac&#39;s phone on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Jacob&#39;s name flash on the screen,Isaac realized his assistant was already waiting outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up, kept it short. &#34;I&#39;ll be right there,&#34; he said,and ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Verena, he asked, &#34;Want me to drop you off at the hospital?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena offered a quick shake of her head. &#34;I&#39;ve got a few things to handle at home. You go on ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her a nod, grabbing his bag. &#34;Okay. I&#39;ll see you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waved her hand. &#34;Have a great day, honey,&#34; she said with a cheerful smile. Once Isaac was gone, Verena reached for her phone and dialed Gavin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he picked up the call, she didn&#39;t waste a second. &#34;Gavin, are you free right now? I need to talk to you about something important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin wasted no time replying, &#34;Of course. I just left my place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena reached the café about twenty minutes later and chose a small table by the window. After a short wait, she spotted Gavin coming through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her hand and called out, &#34;Gavin, over here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crossed the room, slid into the seat across from her, and offered a sheepish grin. &#34;Sorry if I kept you waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena just smiled and waved it off. &#34;Don&#39;t worry,I barely sat down myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gesturing to the cup in front of him, she added,&#34;I got you a cappuccino.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grateful smile spread across Gavin&#39;s face as he took a sip. &#34;Thanks, Evelyn. So, what&#39;s on your mind? Who are we talking about today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena leaned back and took a sip of water, her gaze  thoughtful. &#34;Do you remember Carl Aguilar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin&#39;s brow furrowed in concentration, and then his eyes widened a bit. &#34;You mean that guy you rescued during the Dragon Quarter riot in Clokron?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the one.&#34; Verena confirmed with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Gavin was serving as her intern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she finished Carl&#39;s surgery, the responsibility of overseeing his rehabilitation training mostly fell to Gavin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity sharpened Gavin&#39;s tone. &#34;What&#39;s got you bringing up Carl all of a sudden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of Verena&#39;s doubts over Shawna&#39;s death flashed through his mind, and he leaned in,voice lower. &#34;Did he do something to you, Evelyn? Are you in danger?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena didn&#39;t give him a straight answer. &#34;There&#39;s nothing solid yet, Gavin. I&#39;m still looking for proof.&#34;</p>
