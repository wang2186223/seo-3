                <p>Verena spoke her mind openly, and Danica, watching quietly, felt a quiet admiration stir within her. A subtle smile tugged at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She admired Verena&#39;s straightforwardness. After all that had unfolded, how could Verena possibly remain without a trace of anger in her heart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If a mere apology had made Verena shower her with praise, that would only have unmasked her as insincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Verena&#39;s frank warning-though not easy on the ears-was proof of her honesty and her good nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recalling Verena&#39;s identity as Evelyn, Danica found her heart strangely at peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had no need to curry favor with her. As a legendary healer, Verena could use her influence and connections to confront her if she wished. But Verena didn&#39;t do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That alone revealed two things-Verena respected Isaac, and more importantly, she truly loved him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>加</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica felt blessed to have such a thoughtful and capable daughter-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she reflected, the more her satisfaction grew, yet so did the sting of regret for her past actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out gently, clasped Verena&#39;s hand, and spoke from the heart. &#34;Verena, you have every reason to be upset. I was in the wrong. But rest assured-I give you my word, I will never again intrude in matters between you and Isaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze was steady, her voice firm, her manner utterly sincere. Verena believed her and answered with a soft smile and a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing forgiveness in Verena&#39;s eyes, Danica felt a heavy stone lifted from her chest. Turning slightly, her gaze fell upon Isaac, who was holding a folded sheet of paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had noticed it when they entered, but at the time, her mind had been wholly on apologizing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that peace had been restored, curiosity prompted her to ask, &#34;Isaac, what&#39;s that in your hand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac knew well that Danica&#39;s mistakes were all tied to him. Watching Verena forgive her, he felt a mix of gratitude and faint sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Danica&#39;s question, Isaac blinked, the corners of his lips curling into a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He handed her the paper and said, &#34;Take a look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica accepted it, curiosity bright in her eyes. As she read, her eyes widened in shock. The document nearly slipped from her trembling fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Isaac and Verena, her voice quivering. &#34;Is... is this true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac clasped Verena&#39;s hand, his voice calm yet full of depth. &#34;It&#39;s absolutely true. We just came from the hospital-we&#39;re going to have a baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena touched her still-flat stomach tenderly, her smile gentle. &#34;The doctor said everything looks perfectly normal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing their words, Danica&#39;s heart leapt with joy. Her dignified features blossomed into a radiant smile.60</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes gleamed with delighnt and relief. &#34;This is wonderful! Soon I&#39;ll be a grandmother-there will be a little grandchild in the house!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her excitement brimmed over; she clutched.Verena&#39;s hand tightly.&#34;Verena,thank you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said it again and again, gratitude welling up for both the continuation of the Bennett family and for Verena&#39;s care in restoring Isaac&#39;s health.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica had once believed Isaac might never have children. But then Verena came, healed him,and changed the course of fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she had heard Isaac&#39;s sex function was cured, never had she imagined such a swift and.profound result-a long-awaited grandchild, at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn&#39;s reputation was indeed well-earned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, that remarkable woman was her daughter-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica steadied her heart and silently made a decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking Verena&#39;s hands warmly in her own, she declared, &#34;This is a blessing beyond words. I&#39;ve decided to give you ten percent of my shares, a guarantee for both your and the baby&#39;s future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Verena, raised self-reliant and never accustomed to handouts, found such a gift difficult to accept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head gently, smiling politely as she refused. &#34;Danica, I appreciate your kindness, but I really can&#39;t accept this gift...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica had expected her hesitation. Before Verena could finish, she pressed on, &#34;I&#39;ve thought this through for a long time. I&#39;ll divide twenty percent of my shares into two-half for you, half for Bobby&#39;s wife when he marries. It&#39;s simply a token of my love as an elder. Please,my dear, accept it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena bit her lip and lowered her head, caught between gratitude and reluctance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac leaned toward her, his voice soft but steady. &#34;You&#39;ve earned this. Accepot it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting Danica&#39;s earnest gaze, Verena finally nodded, her voice quiet yet clear. &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll accept. Thank you,Danica.&#34;	50</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s face lit with joy. With her offer accepted, she immediately called Rhonda to discuss dietary care for the coming months. She also gathered the household staff, instructing them that Verena&#39;s well-being would now come first in all matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not stopping there, Danica herself prepared a pot of nourishing soup before getting ready to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena invited her to stay for dinner. And when she saw that her daughter-in-law harbored no trace of resentment, Danica&#39;s heart swelled with both shame and gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, the three lingered in conversation until at last Danica took her leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Verena was newly pregnant, Isaac worried about her tiring easily and guided her upstairs early to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just before bed, Verena&#39;s phone rang.</p>
