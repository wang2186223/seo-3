                <p>Sherwood&#39;s office felt like a cave where shadows huddled, thick with an uneasiness that lingered in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let a cold, crooked smile form on his lips, and there was something wicked curling behind it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nobody ordinary stands a chance against those who hold real power. No matter how wealthy a businessman becomes, he&#39;s still just someone the authorities can crush,&#34; said Sherwood, his voice a rough whisper, each word carrying a bitter chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone working in this city&#39;s business world knew a single truth: beneath the polished surface and busy deals, there was a line no one dared to cross.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If someone got reckless enough to ignore the rules set by those at the top, it was the same as inviting disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s gaze drifted to the tall window. Luis had done everything he could to keep his people away from the things that could destroy him. But if he really thought he was safe, then Sherwood would make sure they waded in so deep they&#39;d never pull themselves free.&#34; With his hands folded behind him, Sherwood squinted into the city lights, his expression alive with the feverish confidence of someone willing to gamble everything for revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind kept circling back. He wondered how long Luis&#39; calm would last when the evidence landed in his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood spun away from the window and crossed to his desk. With a few sharp raps of his knuckles, he instructed his secretary, his tone as cold as ice, &#34;Get me Daren&#39;s contact information and send it to me.I need to set up a meeting. I&#39;ll handle it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, the secretary froze, caught off guard by the request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood the kind of trouble Daren Robles could bring, and if Sherwood wanted to get in touch,it could only mean he was about to do something dangerous,something outside the law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, after so many years at Sherwood&#39;s side, the secretary knew better than to hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dipped his head and replied without question, &#34;Yes,sir. I&#39;ll get right on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned on his heel to leave. &#34;Hold on.&#34; Sherwood&#39;s voice cut through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary turned back to face him and gave a small nod. &#34;Is there anything else you&#39;d like me to handle,sir?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Replace that chair,&#34; said Sherwood, eyeing the broken seat by the desk. His order was as clipped as a slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary didn&#39;t blink. &#34;Right away, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a crisp nod, he offered a respectful bow before stepping out and shutting the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Sherwood eased himself into the new chair his staff had provided. Every ounce of his attention was fixed on the tiny hourglass nestled in his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crystal-clear glass caught the light. Golden grains trickled through the slim waist of the hourglass,pooling at the bottom with silent urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rolled the delicate object between his thick fingers,eyes narrowed and dark with a simmering malice as he watched each speck of sand slip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time&#39;s running out for me, just like the sand in this thing,&#34; said Sherwood, his voice a low rumble that echoed through the stillness of the room. &#34;Everything I want comes down to this move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood found himself thinking back to the long years he had spent clawing his way through the ruthless world of business, remembering how he had gone from a man no one noticed to someone with power and a name that carried weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the only one who truly understood the weight of the trials he had pushed through, the kind that left no marks but never really faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now, Verena, Isaac, and Luis seemed determined to stand in his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened as he glared at the wall. &#34;You three,you have no idea what I&#39;m capable of. I&#39;m not the type to let anybody walk all over me,&#34; said Sherwood,his tone ice-cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning the hourglass upside down, he watched the sands begin anew and let out a sharp, mocking snort.&#34;If I can flip the hourglass, I can flip this whole game.You&#39;ll all regret crossing me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, his phone lit up with a new message -Daren&#39;s number, courtesy of his secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Sherwood copied the number,tapped it into his phone, and waited for the call to connect. For a while, only the sound of ringing filled his ear.Then someone picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A disguised voice, so muffled and deep that it could have belonged to anyone, spoke. &#34;Who&#39;s there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting straighter, Sherwood cleared his throat, and his voice took on a bright, almost cheerful note. &#34;Daren.It&#39;s Sherwood Kirk. Been a long time. How&#39;s life treating you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on his face was all for show, though Daren couldn&#39;t see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the voice distortion, Daren answered with a hollow laugh, &#34;So you finally remembered me,Mr.Kirk?I&#39;m just trying to stay alive out here. That&#39;s all I can ask for. I bet things are looking up for you, though,huh? Business must be good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither man spoke plainly, every line carefully wrapped in polite words while their true intentions flickered beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They kept up the illusion of friendly conversation,trading small talk and pleasantries, but every phrase came with a hidden edge. With each reply, they searched for weakness or motive, never letting their guard down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood steered the conversation with patience,  well aware that Daren wasn&#39;t someone who&#39;d be lured in by reckless promises. He needed to let the tension build,drawing Daren in little by little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he sensed Daren was listening, Sherwood dropped the pretense. &#34;Listen, Daren, I&#39;ve got a job for you. There&#39;s something I want to buy, something special. You know how I operate. I pay well, so you won&#39;t regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat of silence hung in the air as Daren considered his options.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daren lived on the edge, always watching for threats.He never stuck to one place, and he avoided anything that felt like a setup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he spoke again, his answer came measured and cool. &#34;I can tell you&#39;re sincere, Mr. Kirk. I&#39;ll see what l can do, but this won&#39;t happen overnight. Give me until the night after tomorrow. We&#39;ll talk face-to-face.Does that work for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s lips twisted in a faint, satisfied grin. &#34;Good enough for me. I&#39;ll wait for your call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the arrangement was set, both men ended the conversation without further ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back, Sherwood shut his eyes halfway and let his thoughts run wild. Golden trophies and expensive art caught the light around his office. His mouth curled with a cold amusement as he glanced at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daren, everything depends on you. Don&#39;t disappoint me,&#34; he whispered, his voice carrying a quiet warning meant for Daren alone. ...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two days later, the sun dipped behind the city,neon signs flickering to life as the evening deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long before, Daren had phoned in to say he was already waiting at the club for Sherwood&#39;s arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in a crisp, dark suit patterned with subtle stripes, Sherwood tugged his sleeves into place. He looked at the butler, Aiken Morley, and asked, &#34;ls everything ready on your end?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a respectful nod, Aiken replied, &#34;Everything&#39;s handled,just like you wanted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood made a low sound of approval and then gave Aiken a sharp look. &#34;Watch Molly closely. She&#39;s not to leave this house, especially if she tries to see anyone from the Sampson family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aiken acknowledged with another nod. Just then, the driver appeared, bowing slightly as he announced, &#34;Sir, your car is out front.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood nodded in response and strode toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gleaming black vehicle waited by the entrance,the tinted windows concealing everything inside from the outside world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, the driver stepped up and opened the door for Sherwood, who slipped into the back seat.</p>
