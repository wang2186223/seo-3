                <p>Verena&#39;s words had scarcely settled when the people in the conference room exchanged furtive glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitation clouded their eyes, every face painted with inner conflict and contradiction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each was secretly weighing the pros and cons. The project promised fat profits, yet the looming shadow of prison was a price none wished to pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the air was thick enough to cut with a knife,leaving everyone restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly observed coldly, savoring their wavering expressions. A trace of delight curled in her chest.She lifted her chin, a sly smile tugging at her lips, her narrowed eyes glinting with contempt-as though she were already watching Verena tumble from her pedestal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as Molly was about to revel in mocking Verena&#39;s boldness, the unexpected struck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A young man in the front row clenched his teeth, his hand trembling slightly as he slowly raised it. His hoarse voice broke the silence. &#34;I support Mrs.Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment was like the first domino tipping,sparking a chain reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, others summoned courage and lifted their hands as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One,two,three...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hand after hand rose, each one striking Molly like a stinging slap, draining the smile from her face in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her complexion turned ashen. Eyes wide, lips trembling,fists clenched tight-her nails dug deep into her palms, yet she felt nothing. Never had she imagined that those who once obeyed her commands would turn their backs at such a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this silent duel, the verdict had already been cast by the raised hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stood quietly, her gaze steady and resolute,sweeping across the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her calm expression radiated confidence, as though she held the reins of fate itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since everyone agrees with my decision, the project  will cease immediately,&#34; Verena said with a slight nod,her lips pressed firmly, her voice sincere. &#34;Rest assured,under my leadership, the company will walk the right path, and your hard work will not go unrewarded.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her deliberate stress on &#34;right path&#34; echoed in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s face paled, then flushed, her eyes burning with resentment. Rage and unwillingness welled up,yet she had no words to counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s gaze brushed lightly over her before settling on the others. &#34;That will be all. The meeting is over-return to your work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendees, all seasoned professionals, quickly grasped the undercurrents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without needing further instructions, they sensed the sharp edge of conflict in the room. So, once Verena spoke, they breathed a sigh of relief, rising together and filing out with lowered heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One after another, they left-until Molly alone remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting her lip, eyes blazing with defiance, she fixed her gaze on Verena&#39;s retreating figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bythe way.&#34; Verena halted mid-step, turning with composed elegance.Her eyes fell gently on Molly, calm as a still lake.&#34;Miss Kirk, don&#39;t forget to hand me the files I asked you to organize by day&#39;s end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised an eyebrow, a flicker of a smile touching her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly sat frozen, her chest rising and faling sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The contrast of their positions-manager versus CEO -stabbed at her pride like a thorn lodged too deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Verena returned to her office. She went straight to her desk, sat down, and drew in a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers rubbed her temples before she reached for her phone and dialed Luis&#39; number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call connected swiftly, and Verena wasted no time. &#34;I need to speak to you about Molly. She has been putting personal gain above the company&#39;s interests,nearly letting substandard drugs slip into the market. That would not only ruin our reputation but also harm countless lives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; deep, magnetic voice carried restrained anger.&#34;She certainly has nerve.&#34; Verena continued, &#34;I exposed the issue in today&#39;s meeting and halted the project. But she won&#39;t surrender so easily. My plan is to gradually strip her of her authority.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Luis replied with measured calm,&#34;Verena, I trust your judgment. Benedict Pharmaceuticals is under your care, and I have every confidence in you. No need to wait for my approval -make the decisions you see fit.Whatever you need,I&#39;ll back you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lips curved into a soft smile. &#34;Thank you, Luis.With your support, I feel even more assured.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Molly stormed into her office,kicking the trash bin at her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp clang, it toppled, spilling its contents across the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fury surged; she swept every document off her desk,the papers scattering like fallen leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Collapsing into her chair, she seized her phone and dialed Sherwood&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the call connected, her voice cracked with rage and tears. &#34;Dad, you can&#39;t imagine how outrageous Verena was today! She utterly disregarded me!&#34; Sherwood&#39;s voice, deep and seasoned by years of business storms, came through steady. &#34;Molly, calm yourself. Tell me everything clearly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sucked in a sharp breath, her voice sharp as a blade. &#34;Verena openly opposed my project in the meeting. She even swayed everyone to her side,leaving me completely humiliated!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she spoke, the more agitated she became,eyes red and brimming. &#34;Dad, don&#39;t forget-we saved the Sampson family! Without us, they wouldn&#39;t stand where they are now. Yet Verena dares to treat me this way. How am I supposed to swallow this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood snorted coldly. &#34;I always knew Verena and Isaac would be hard opponents. But heed me-acting rashly inside the company will only work against you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back in his leather chair, he scattered fish food into the tank. A swarm of colorful fish darted in frenzy, fighting for each morsel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said slowly, &#34;Molly, business is a battlefield where timing and tactics mean everything. It&#39;s a game of chess-win with strategy, not impulse. You clashed with her today, and what happened? She turned the tables,leaving you humiliated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s voice trembled, thick with grievance. &#34;Then what should I do, Dad? Just choke back my pride?&#34; Sherwood&#39;s brow furrowed, his tone sharpened.&#34;Swallow your pride? Never. But we must change tactics.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Softening slightly, he comforted her, saying &#34;Listen carefully-calm yourself. Don&#39;t let Verena sense another move. On the surface, keep working as usual,cooperate where required.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And then?&#34; Molly pressed, eager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood set the fish food aside, leaning back with narrowed eyes that carried a glacial edge. &#34;Leave the rest to me. Trust me-I won&#39;t let you suffer.&#34;</p>
