                <p>When Verena shut the door, silence instantly swallowed the office whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda was the first to gather herself,her expression serene, the same mischievous smile still dancing on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her slender fingers skimmed along the edge of Luis &#39;open collar as she leaned closer, her warm breath whispering against his ear. &#34;Well, it looks like Verena just caught sight of something she never should have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; gaze sharpened at once, the haze in his eyes clearing. Though his voice carried a hoarse undertone,he kept his tone even. &#34;Miss Brown, this is an office.Conduct yourself properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Miranda seemed bent on ignoring that line.Instead of moving away, she nestled closer into his arms, her arms sliding around his neck. Triumph curved her mouth. &#34;With your shirt already halfway undone, isn&#39;t it a little late for reminders, Mr. Sampson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She arched her brows in playful challenge, her eyes glinting with mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; lips formed a faint, unreadable smile, his dark gaze steady on her. &#34;You were the one who wagered that if I kissed you willingly within fifteen minutes, I&#39;d accept your earlier proposal. Time&#39;s up, Miss Brown.You&#39;ve lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unruffled, Miranda tilted her chin toward the wall clock, her red lips bending upward. &#34;Isn&#39;t there still a minute left?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint crease formed on Luis&#39; forehead, confusion flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he considered what ploy she might try next, a firm hand suddenly gripped the back of his neck and tugged him close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body stiffened, an instinctive urge to resist flashing through him, but before he could act, Miranda&#39;s breath was already mingling with his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The distance between them vanished, their quickened breaths colliding in the charged space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; lashes quivered, his lips parting to speak-but Miranda silenced him with a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For an instant, his mind went blank, thought and reason frozen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, like floodgates breaking, memories long buried surged back, drowning him in recollections of that reckless,fevered night.Everything replayed in his mind as vividly as if a reel of film were spinning before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dazed only for a heartbeat, his gaze soon darkened,depth and danger interwoven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallowed hard, one hand cupping the back of her head,his fingers weaving into her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that moment, control was an illusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The once-quiet air of the office seemed to flare into flame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Documents slid from the desk, strewn across the floor like leaves in the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world outside ceased to matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; tie pooled at his feet,several buttons gone from his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s hair tumbled loosely down, strands clinging to her flushed cheeks, enhancing her allure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Verena waited neither too close nor too far from the office, perched on a high stool with the city spread out below. Her eyes looked vacant, her thoughts adrift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the fifth time, she glanced at her watch-just as the office door clicked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning,she spotted Miranda approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s hair was slightly tousled, her once-polished outfit a little undone, though her lips curved into a smile that betrayed her satisfaction-like a cat fresh from mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lips tugged into a knowing smile as her gaze swept Miranda up and down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she reached out and brushed at Miranda&#39;s cheek, her tone playful. &#34;You&#39;ve got a touch of lipstick smudged there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crossing her arms, she tilted her head, her eyes dancing. &#34;So, Miss Brown, care to explain what&#39;s going on between you and my brother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda showed no hint of shame. Instead,she looped an arm casually around Verena&#39;s neck, her grin lighthearted. &#34;Darling, shouldn&#39;t you be warning me not to meddle with him unless I mean it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena laughed softly, shaking her head. &#34;We&#39;re all grown-ups. He knows whether you mean it or not.Why should I step in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Admiration flickered in Miranda&#39;s eyes. She arched a brow. &#34;As perceptive as ever. No wonder I like you so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She released Verena, smoothed her hair, and waved a careless farewell. &#34;Well, I&#39;ve got errands to run. See you,darling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heels tapped a steady rhythm as she left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena watched her slip into an elevator,shaking her head with an amused smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The office, in contrast, bore the look of a storm&#39;s passing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Papers once stacked neatly were scattered across the floor,bent and jumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; chair sat at an awkward angle, its cushion askew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A delicate crystal ornament had toppled, shattered into fragments that gleamed shaply in the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, a coffee cup lay overturned, its dark stain spreading across the desk and dripping down in crooked trails.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis stood before the desk, hands braced on his hips.The creases in his collar betrayed the disarray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hair, usually groomed to precision, now fell in untamed strands over his forehead, lending him an air  of roguish abandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood tinged his eyes, his chest rising unevenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The office brimmed with warmth and static, as if the air itself pulsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his head back, eyes closed, drawing in a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The floral trace of Miranda&#39;s perfume lingered,mingling with the woody note of his cologne-a dangerous mix pulling him back toward their heated encounter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brow twitched, as though the scent itself was a provocation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to steady himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he opened his eyes again, confusion and yearning flickered in their depths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling himself together, he reached for the intercom,his voice rougher than usual. &#34;Send someone to clean up my office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hung up and strode toward the shower in the rest area.</p>
