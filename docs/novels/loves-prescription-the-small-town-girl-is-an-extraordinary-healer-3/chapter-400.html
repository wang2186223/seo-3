                <p>Sherwood leaned back against the iron chair, the metalic clink of his handcuffs striking like cruel music against the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Humph.Like brother?&#34; He sneered, his eyes glittering with contempt as they lingered on Joseph&#39;s twisted face.Remorse had no place there. &#34;Joseph, if you had ever truly treated me like a brother, you wouldn&#39;t have swallowed the Ochrerayd market whole!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly leaned forward, veins straining in his neck.&#34;You knew I was too ambitious to crawl beneath you.While you basked in the sunlight at the summit,I spent every day plotting how to drag you down into the mud!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His agitation mounted; he gasped as sweat slid down his face.&#34;Conscience? A useless trinket! In this world of wolves, only profit is eternal. You know what?When I stole your daughter all those years ago,watching you collapse in despair became my sweetest victory!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood threw his head back and laughed-a harsh,unhinged sound that filled the cramped interrogation room like a banshee&#39;s cry. &#34;Every time I watched you lot running in circles, struggling, I raised a glass at parties to toast to power and money.With those two,one could always sidestep the law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,he leaned toward the bulletproof glass, his nose almost touching the cold surface, his breath fogging it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He narrowed his eyes and appraised Joseph, who barely held himself upright, from head to toe.A sinister smile tugged at his mouth. &#34;Joseph, look at you now. No longer standing on top of the world,huh?How did you wind up like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drawled the words with mockery, the laugh carving deeper lines in his face. &#34;Joseph, do you think I&#39;d feel guilty? Let me tell you the truth-every time 1remember you sobbing at the police station, I felt I&#39;d done something monumental. Hahaha!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis remained rooted, his nails biting into his palms,the metallic taste of blood filling his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched his father&#39;s faltering figure while his mother&#39;s cries in a hospital room-echoes that had haunted them for twenty-five years-rang in his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The overhead light in the interrogation room hummed,throwing Sherwood&#39;s insolence into stark relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis felt his temples throb as he stared at Sherwood&#39;s contorted face. The urge to kill nearly drowned out reason. The thuds of Joseph hammering the bulletproof glass grew louder, his voice raw with rage. &#34;You bastard!You&#39;ll die a miserable death!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, the older commanding officer and two younger officers moved in and restrained Joseph,who had lost control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir,please calm down. There are cameras here,&#34; one of the young officers warned, the sound of metal clattering underlining his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis drew a steadying breath to swallow the tidal wave of fury and turned to Joseph. &#34;Dad, please go. I&#39;ll handle this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his tone was decisive and measured,a tremor still threaded through it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Joseph was escorted out, Luis walked slowly to the bulletproof glass and dragged an iron chair to sit.The chair&#39;s legs scraped across the floor in a grating protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat upright, hands folded on his knees, unusually composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the glass he locked eyes with Sherwood,his gaze cold as steel, aiming to pierce the madness behind Sherwood&#39;s stare. &#34;Go on. I&#39;m curious about what other filthy words you have.&#34; Sherwood shook his wrists in annoyance. &#34;What?Feeling sorry for your old man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cocked his head, eyes bright with provocation.&#34;Watching him crawl into churches and beg for salvation back then-that was the real entertainment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Sherwood finished, Luis leaned forward without warning. &#34;Do you think that rattles me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice dropped low but carried an unmistakable force. &#34;Don&#39;t forget: now that you&#39;re cuffed,you&#39;ll spend the rest of your days repenting behind bars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, enunciating each word like a measured strike. &#34;The more you thrash, the clearer your fear becomes. Wait and see-the law will make you answer for every vile word and every crime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood paused his fiddling with the handcuffs. His Adam&#39;s apple bobbed; veins in his neck bulged like pale cords.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glass caught the tiny constriction of his pupils,and Luis seized that fleeting hint of panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Sherwood could twist his mouth into another sneer, Luis moved closer, the collar of his suit grazing the metal table&#39;s edge. &#34;You were comfortable for over twenty years, living like royalty. Did you really believe it would last forever?&#34; Sherwood&#39;s spine stiffened involuntarily. His chair scraped faintly against the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis curled an index finger and struck the table with it -a heavy knock that made Sherwood flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tapped out a slow, deliberate rhythm; the metal&#39;s vibration sounded like a metronome aimed at Sherwood&#39;s core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Money laundering, arms smuggling, child trafficking ...&#34; Luis let the list hang, slowing his cadence to watch the color drain from Sherwood&#39;s face. &#34;When the verdict comes, you may not have much time left even in prison.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear-real and raw-finally showed in Sherwood&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of waiting for a verdict in a cell, or of someone else deciding his fate, tightened like a vise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a man who worshipped his image, the prospect was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Sherwood seemed to recall something;his tense shoulders eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a hoarse laugh. A sick, victorious flicker lit his eyes. &#34;Luis, you must&#39;ve forgotten-I&#39;m a cancer patient.&#34; He coughed on purpose, a flush rising faintly on his sallow face. &#34;The cancer&#39;s everywhere; the doctors say I&#39;m not long for this world. My health&#39;s failing by the day...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lingered on the last words, a warped smile twisting them. &#34;I won&#39;t be suffering in prison for long. You won&#39;t get the satisfaction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis watched Sherwood&#39;s theatrics with a cold smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rose slowly and looked down at the man behind the glass, irony plain in his eyes. &#34;Do you really think you can wiggle out of this with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew a diagnostic report from a folder and slammed it down on the table. &#34;I&#39;ll have Verena treat you. Don&#39;t forget-she&#39;s Evelyn, a renowned medical mind, and highly skilled at treating so-called terminal patients like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis leaned in, words clipped and precise. &#34;Rest assured, you will live. And you will watch the law take you apart.&#34;</p>
