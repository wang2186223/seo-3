                <p>The Lyons family had nothing to do with the Willis family, so Kaia couldn&#39;t believe it when Slater suddenly sent her an invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Kaia saw the invitation, she didn&#39;t know what to think. Laura, however, immediately guessed that Slater might be interested in Kaia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea excited Kaia, though she could only remember one embarrassing moment when he skipped out on her birthday party. Aside from that,they hardly spoke. Maybe Slater only reached out because he was close with Bobby, and since she had been interacting with Bobby a lot recently, he felt it natural to include her too. Whatever the reason, Kaia didn&#39;t mind. As long as the connection worked in her favor,she welcomed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,you don&#39;t need to remind me. I already know what I&#39;m doing,&#34; said Kaia, proudly adjusting the pearl necklace in front of the mirror. She turned slightly and asked, &#34;How do I look?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s eyes softened as she watched her daughter dress so carefully. &#34;You look beautiful, sweetheart. The prettiest of them all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura stood behind her, fixing a few strands of Kaia&#39;s hair before another thought came to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, isn&#39;t Slater&#39;s grandfather Barrie in poor health?Since you&#39;re studying medicine, you could show him a few ways to take better care of himself.Maybe even send some health supplements. His son and daughter -in-law are known to be very devoted. If Barrie takes a liking to you, it could open doors for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Shoildon, the Lyons family didn&#39;t hold as much power as the Bennett family, but they were still influential. If the Willis family managed to win their favor, their standing in the city would rise quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia fully understood the value of her mother&#39;s suggestion and knew exactly why it mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to her mother with a confident smile.&#34;You don&#39;t have to worry, Mom. I&#39;ve already taken care of everything. Just relax.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pleased that Kaia grasped her intentions, Laura brushed her fingers across her daughter&#39;s cheek. &#34;You really are thoughtful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Laura&#39;s smile faded as she thought of Verena.&#34;Your grandmother spoiled Verena too much. I can&#39;t count on her anymore.&#34; Noticing that Laura had completely lost faith in Verena, Kaia didn&#39;t bother to offer false comfort anymore. She simply held her mother&#39;s hand and said sweetly, &#34;But you still have me,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s pride swelled at Kaia&#39;s words. Even if Verena was beyond saving,she still had her younger daughter.From childhood, Kaia had always been exceptional.She was even considered a lucky star, since the family became millionaires shortly after her birth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she grew older, Kaia stood out in her studies, and it seemed likely she would one day become a respected doctor who brought honor to the family. It was proof that children thrived when they grew up beside their parents. The difference between Kaia and Verena made that obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even on her way to the Lyons estate, Kaia clung to the hope that Slater might like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Slater gave her a polite nod and told someone to show her to the party venue that Kaia understood she was nothing more than one guest among many.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me to send these gifts to your grandfather?&#34; asked Slater&#39;s assistant, gesturing toward the stack of boxes Kaia had brought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater had never thought well of Kaia, and the only reason he invited her was to ease his guilt for skipping her birthday party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he truly couldn&#39;t stand was the way Kaia tried so desperately, and so insincerely, to force a connection with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater glanced at the boxes, and then waved dismissively. &#34;Put them in the warehouse. After the party, let the servants divide them up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant nodded and quickly ordered the staff to move the boxes into storage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Lyon family&#39;s estate had two main buildings. The party was held in the front building, while the back was kept more private.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia quickly grew bored at the party since everyone already seemed familiar with one another, leaving her with no chance to join in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, Kaia slipped out of the party with a glass of red wine and strolled onto the small briddge that led toward the back garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she caught sight of a white figure ahead and stiffened. Was that Verena? What was she doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes went wide, and without thinking, Kaia  followed after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She trailed behind until she realized Verena was making her way toward Barrie&#39;s quarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s thoughts raced. It couldn&#39;t be true. What connection could Verena possibly have with Barrie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she struggled to believe it, a ripple of worry spread through her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried her steps, trying to close the gap between herself and the woman ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a few steps later, a familiar voice called out behind her, &#34;Who are you sneaking after? You look way too suspicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby shifted his gaze to where Kaia was looking.Ahead of them, a woman in a white dress with long hair walked away, her figure strikingly familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s nerves spiked again. Bobby had mentioned that he wanted to meet Verena. If he realized the woman ahead of them was her, everything would fall apart.He might decide Verena was good enough to be his sister -in-law and stop trying to break the marriage arrangement. Worse still, all the lies Kaia had told him about Verena would collapse the moment he saw her face. She couldn&#39;t let that happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking fast, Kaia spun around and pulled out her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>phone. &#34;I&#39;m not following anyone. I was just looking around. Anyway, didn&#39;t you say you wanted to meet Verena? I can give you her contact info so you two can talk&lt;.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words caught Bobby off guard, though he still looked skeptical. &#34;You&#39;re serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia nodded quickly. &#34;Of course. Why would I lie about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby pulled his phone from his jacket pocket.&#34;Alright then. I&#39;ll trust you on this one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he sent the friend request, Bobby held out his phone for her tosee.&#34;This the right one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia gave it a quick glance, and then smiled as she nodded. &#34;Yeah, that&#39;s her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied with her answer, Bobby slipped his phone back into his pocket and walked off without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he left, Kaia pulled out her phone. She switched to her alternate account and accepted Bobby&#39;s request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way she&#39;d let Bobby meet Verena, so she wasn&#39;t foolish enough to give him a real number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, she hadn&#39;t even added Verena on any chat app  herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time midnight drew near, the party had finally come to an end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Barrie&#39;s room, Verena had just completed another round of treatment for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrie had been feeling much stronger recently, and tonight he leaned against the headboard with a cheerfuL expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m really sorry for taking up so much of your time,Dr. Willis,&#34; Barrie said apologetically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave a calm smile. &#34;Please don&#39;t say that. It&#39;s part of my responsibility.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After exchanging a few more words with him, Verena excused herself and left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By then, most guests had already drifted out of the front building. After saying goodbye to Slater, Bobby was ready to head out as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he turned to leave, he stopped short. A woman in a white wool coat and faded denim jeans passed by.Her skin was luminous, her lashes curled delicately,and her profile was striking. What caught him most was her cool, almost untouchable air. That was...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!&#34; Bobby shouted as he rushed after her. Verena came to a stop, her brows knitting as she turned to the young man blocking her path. &#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m the one you pulled out of that wreck. You saved me after the crash,&#34; said Bobby, his voice rushing with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, Verena finally recalled the incident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a small nod. &#34;So, what is it? Are you feeling unwell, or do you need something from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby nodded eagerly, words rushing to the tip of his tongue but refusing to come out. &#34;I&#39;ve got something to tell you, but... give me a moment to find the right words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you happen to know Dr.Willis?&#34;</p>
