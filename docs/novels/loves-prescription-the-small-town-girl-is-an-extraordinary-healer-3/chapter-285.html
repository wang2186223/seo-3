                <p>&#34;Verena.&#34; Isaac&#39;s voice carried a trace of unease as it cut through the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound, Verena instinctively pulled her hands away from Ivan and turned, surprise flashing in her eyes when she saw Isaac sitting in his wheelchair not far off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she stepped back, a gulf opened between her and Ivan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan remained in place, his eyes swollen and red, grief clouding his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes settled on Ivan at last, and the sight of his tear-stained face and shaking sobs made him stop in his tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes then shifted back to Verena. She stood in her white coat at the OR doors, her shoulders heavy with exhaustion, looking as if she had just walked out of a long operation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, Isaac&#39;s jealousy crumbled, replaced by guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It became painfully clear, Verena had been telling the truth. She had been saving a life, not betraying him as his doubts had suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena blinked herself out of her daze, the corners of her lips lifting slightly as she hurried over to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac, why are you here?&#34; she asked, still surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flickered between her and Ivan before softening. &#34;The guard mentioned you rushed to Crilizult.You&#39;re pregnant, and I was worried something might happen, so l came.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m alright,&#34; Verena said quietly, her brows drawing together. &#34;Ivan&#39;s friend was in a car accident. It was urgent. I just came as fast as I could, and I didn&#39;t have time to call. I&#39;m sorry for worrying you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan&#39;s friend?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac cast a look at the operating room. &#34;Is the surgery finished?&#34; Verena gave a small nod.&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the condition now?&#34; he pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The operation went smoothly, but...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan darted forward before she could finish, gripping her arm with desperation in his eyes. &#34;Verena, if the operation worked, that means she&#39;s going to be alright, doesn&#39;t it? She&#39;ll open her eyes again, won&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice broke apart between sobs, the words spilling out in a rush. &#34;You&#39;ve saved countless people before.Have you ever seen someone like her? Has anyone stayed unconscious even when the surgery went well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan&#39;s composure was unraveling, his grief spilling over until he seemed completely unmoored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena wrenched herself free and seized Ivan by the shoulders, her grip firm. Her voice rose as her eyes locked on his. &#34;Ivan, look at me. Breathe. Think carefully, have I ever once failed you? Even once?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips parted, but no words came out. He only shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, Verena had always stood like a miracle worker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never let him down, not with her steady hands, her fierce determination, or the quiet kindness she always carried.	A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She carried herself with such certainty that it felt like nothing in the world could stand in her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once his trembling eased, Verena pressed on. &#34;Luciana&#39;s situation is serious, but far from hopeless. The operation went well. Her chances of waking up are strong. But the injury is delicate, so even if she regains consciousness, complications may remain. With careful rehab and the right therapies, I can guide her step by step toward recovery. For now, the most important thing is that she wakes up. You told me she&#39;s always been cheerful, full of fight. That spirit will help her through this. I believe she&#39;ll come back. But you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes swept over his reddened gaze, taking in the fatigue etched into his features. &#34;You can&#39;t keep burning yourself out. If you collapse, you&#39;ll be no help to her. Take a break. I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re the first to know when there&#39;s news.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The steadiness in her eyes poured into him, like an anchor for his shaken soul. Ivan inhaled deeply, drawing strength from her words, his breathing evening out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening his back, he managed a frail smile. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about me. You&#39;re the one who should go rest now. You&#39;ve been running nonstop for my sake. You barely got off the plane before rushing into surgery.And with the baby coming, you need rest more than anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words had barely left him when a chill crawled up his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning his head, he found Isaac&#39;s eyes fixed on him, stern and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan stiffened, and then quickly dipped his head in greeting. &#34;Hi, Isaac, maybe you should take your wife to a hotel to rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unexpected remark made Isaac&#39;s brows rise slightly in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan&#39;s words-&#34;youur wife&#34;-caught Isaac off guard, shaking the certainty he had clung to for so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For an instant, his thoughts wavered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That small tattoo etched on Verena&#39;s collarbone-the single letter l-had always filled him with suspicion,making him believe it was tied to lvan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now, it seemed that the connection never existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could he have been mistaken from the start?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew men well enough. If a man still harbored feelings for his ex, he would never speak to her husband in a way that openly affirmed their bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac quickly buried the turmoil in his chest, giving only a faint nod in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, still pale from the strain of surgery and pregnancy, felt exhaustion weighing heavily on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, she let Isaac guide her to a nearby hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The presidential suite exuded grandeur. Soft light spilled from a glittering chandelier, washing over the carved furniture with a warm glow. The thick carpet muffled every step, plush beneath her feet like walking on clouds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she crossed the threshold, the rich scent of freshly prepared food greeted her.</p>
