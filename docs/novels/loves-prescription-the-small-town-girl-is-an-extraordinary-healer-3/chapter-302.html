                <p>Isaac&#39;s brows drew together in a deep frown as he held back his desire, and Verena found the sight both tender and pitiful, like laughter caught in the middle of sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning closer, she gently pressed her forehead against his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their foreheads touched lightly, sharing a fleeting yet intimate moment. In a whisper soft as the rustle of leaves, she said, &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll stop teasing you. We have a whole lifetime ahead of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, at Evelyn Model Hospital..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s pregnancy was advancing, making her every step heavier and more cumbersome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her once brisk and graceful pace had slowed, and her workload at the hospital had to be cut down considerably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That morning, Verena stepped into the operating room. This time, she wasn&#39;t the surgeon holding the scalpel.Instead, she sat nearby, guiding the resident trainees through the procedure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The operating room glowed under the bright lights.Instruments gave off steady, rhythmic sounds, filling the air with a solemn tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trainees were fully absorbed, carrying out their duties with painstaking care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clad in a crisp white coat, her figure marked by the gentle swell of pregnancy, Verena sat upright in a specially designed chair, her gaze unwavering as she followed every move at the operating table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One trainee held a scalpe,his hands trembling,sweat beading on his forehead-a clear picture of nerves stretched taut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darted back and forth between the incision and Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his anxiety, Verena leaned forward slightly,her voice calm and reassuring. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Keep your hand steady, just follow the steps we went over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pointed to a key area, directing his attention to the crucial point of the procedure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him, another trainee was suturing, his movements clumsy, the tension of each stitch wavering and uneven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s brows knitted slightly. &#34;When suturing,keep the pressure even, and make sure the stitches are spaced consistently. That ensures better healing afterward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, she lifted a pair of tweezers and demonstrated, her motions smooth as flowing water -drawing admiring looks from the surrounding trainees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under her careful guidance, the young doctors gained confidence, and the surgery moved forward in steady order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the operation ended, midday break finally arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stretched her back, rose slowly, and stepped out of the operating room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that very moment, Julianna, having just finished her rounds, caught sight of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried over, her smile bright and warm. &#34;Evelyn,care to join me for lunch?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning toward the familiar voice, Verena smiled gently and declined with courtesy. &#34;Thank you,but l already have plans. Perhaps another time?&#34; Julianna&#39;s face showed a flicker of disappointment,her lips pursed before she nodded. &#34;Alright then. I&#39;ll see you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Julianna walked away, Verena slipped into a quiet corner of the hallway, took out her phone, and dialed Luis&#39; number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he answered, she asked softly, &#34;Luis, do you have time now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; voice, touched with a smile, came through the line. &#34;I was just about to ask if you&#39;d join me for lunch,and then your call came. Are you still at the hospital?I&#39;ll drive over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, it was Isaac who waited for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with Luis, there was a warmth of kinship,a different kind of anticipation that steadied her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like comfort arriving by two different paths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s devotion was born of love; Luis&#39; presence was the embrace of family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile deepened as she answered, &#34;Alright.I&#39;ll wait for you at the hospital entrance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She descended by elevator and waited on the steps outside. Before long, a black Cayenne rolled into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recognized it instantly, her lips curving into an unbidden smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car eased to a stop before her, the window lowered, revealing Luis&#39; steady, mature face. &#34;Have you been waiting long, Verena?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head with a soft smile. &#34;No,I just came out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even before she finished, Luis was already out of the car, opening the door for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured her thanks and slid inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car pulled awvay from the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she had work in the afternoon, Verena suggested they go to a nearby restaurant known for its authentic dishes-saving both time and effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,the Cayenne stopped at the restaurant entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The facade was refined, the sign prominent. A doorman quickly stepped forward, opening the car door in welcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the décor was tasteful, the lighting soft,wrapping the space in a pleasant and homely warmth. Verena, familiar with the place, chose a seat by the window, where the sunlight streamed in-perfect for a quiet meal and a private talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis slid the menu toward her with a smile. &#34;Order whatever you like. Think of it as a reward from your elder brother for all your hard work as the great doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a laugh, Verena accepted the menu, took her time, and made the selections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After placing the order, as they waited for the dishes,she leaned slightly forward, elbow resting on the table,fingers tapping lightly. &#34;Luis, there&#39;s something I need to discuss with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes, deep and perceptive, flickered with understanding, a composed smile playing at hislips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back, shoulders straight, he radiated the calm assurance of a seasoned man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head gently, his voice confident yet teasing. &#34;I also have something to tell you. But l suspect we&#39;re thinking of the same thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena tilted her head, smiling at the unspoken bond between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a sip of water to ease her throat, and then  set the glass down, her expression sharpening into seriousness. &#34;Since it&#39;s clear now that Alec and Laura never knew I wasn&#39;t their biological daughter, then I must have been secretly swapped at birth. At that time, Alec and Laura had little to their name,so there was no reason to target them. That means the real target must have been the Sampson family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows furrowed as she thought aloud, her fingers tapping a steady rhythm on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe someone sought an opening to approach the Sampsons and then exchanged me with the Willis baby. The aim was to strike the Sampson family hard.I see two possible results: one, after the Sampsons were shaken, their business would falter, projects slipping into rival hands, bringing enormous profit to others. Two, it might simply have been vengeance-a cruel desire to sow pain and chaos within the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her gaze, she met Luis&#39; eyes, her expression intent. &#34;Luis, do the Sampsons have any rivals of note?Or in the business world, are there competitors so ruthless that they would stop at nothing to bring the family down?&#34;</p>
