                <p>Soon after, the car rolled to a halt outside the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob assisted Isaac out and into the wheelchair,but before he could offer any more help, Isaac propelled himself ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the house, Isaac scanned the living room, but Verena was nowhere in sight, so he went straight for the elevator and made his way up to the second floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found the bedroom door ajar and entered without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Verena sat in an office chair, her attention buried in a book. When the sound of wheels reached her,she glanced over and greeted him. &#34;Back so soon,Isaac?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her composure gave nothing away, as if the day had been utterly uneventful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for the box sitting next to her hand, Isaac might have believed Stevie&#39;s earlier call was just a trick of his imagination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension showed in Isaac&#39;s grip on the armrests, his eyes clouded with worry. Regardless of her feelings for him, Isaac didn&#39;t want any confusion or distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know if Verena had already peeked inside the box or how he&#39;d explain the necklace and the ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After an uncertain pause, he finally asked, keeping his voice gentle, &#34;Did Stevie stop by today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each word was measured, his gaze watching Verena for any flicker of a reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his barely concealed nerves, Verena offered a small, knowing smile. &#34;He did,&#34; she replied evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he mention anything to you?&#34; Isaac pressed,unable to hide his concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of unease swept over him-what if Stevie had revealed more than he should in front of her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after the words slipped out did Isaac realize he was being obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked away, his lips pressed thin, unable to meet her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena,amused by how unsettled he seemed, let a playful spark light her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned her cheek into her palm and answered with an easy drawl, &#34;Nothing much.&#34; Just as Isaac began to relax, she added, unhurried and soft, &#34;But he did leave something behind-said it was for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knot formed in Isaac&#39;s throat, and a flash of panic flickered in his dark gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing to ignore his unease, Verena casually lifted the box from the table, popped open the lid, and knelt down at his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled at him, twirling the ring in her fingers.&#34;Isaac,who knew you had such a romantic streak? You really didn&#39;t need to go to all this effort. Next time you have a gift for me, just hand it to me yourself.That means more to me than anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, Isaac was too startled to respond, and then he realized her mistake. &#34;Actually, I...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena cut him off, her eyes shining as she studied the ring. &#34;This is wonderful, Isaac. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted it closer to the light, admiring the design.&#34;The diamond was carved into the shape of a rose,right? It&#39;s gorgeous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her joy was so bright that Isaac&#39;s protest faded away.He found himself unable to break the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He only wished her happiness could last like this. As he fell silent, Verena arched a brow and extended her hand,holding the ring out to him.&#34;Will you do the honors?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He accepted the ring, and although his movements were stiff, he slid it onto her finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before the ring made it all the way, Verena pulled her hand back. &#34;Wait, Isaac. Isn&#39;t this one a little loose?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands went still, and for a moment, he drew a blank, frozen by uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of nervousness hit him, stronger than anything he&#39;d felt before-a childhood fear of being caught red -handed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s tone shifted as she inspected the band. &#34;Hold on, what&#39;s this?&#34; She peered closely. &#34;Check out the inside-there&#39;s something carved in here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted the ring to his eye level. &#34;Look, the letter &#39;E.&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze sharpened with suspicion. &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to stand for, Isaac? There&#39;s no &#39;E&#39;in the initials of my name.&#34;</p>
