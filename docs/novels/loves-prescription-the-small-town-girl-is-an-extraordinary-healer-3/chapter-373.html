                <p>A cold gleam flickered in Sherwood&#39;s eyes as he sized up the contents of the boxes. Nothing about this haul was ordinary. Anyone with half a brain could see these were the kind of items that would ruin reputations, if not entire empires. All it would take was a single leak to the authorities, and the damage would be irreversible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis thought he could crush him and erase every trace of his legacy, but tonight, Sherwood was rewriting the script. If these goods found their way into Luis&#39; world,the fallout would be swift and catastrophic. Every ounce of power Luis had clawed for would turn to ashes the moment the police closed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s knuckles tightened, but he forced himself to stay composed. No hint of emotion crossed his face as he met Daren&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling himself upright, he met Daren&#39;s eyes with calm resolve. &#34;You know, Daren, you&#39;re right about one thing: we both know how precious time is in this game.So let&#39;s skip the formalities. I&#39;m representing the Sampson family on this job. Mr. Sampson has a particular need for exactly this quantity, and he&#39;s put me in charge of the transaction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting his words hang, Sherwood pressed on, &#34;You understand what kind of reach the Sampsons have. If we make this work, you&#39;ll see even bigger deals coming your way. So, tell me, what&#39;s your number?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood spoke with a calmness that sounded effortless, but every word was deliberate, meant to uncover something hidden. He understood that with someone like Daren, who always played two steps ahead,the smallest detail could shift the outcome. He needed Daren to believe the Sampson family was running the show, so when the dust settled, the blame would land exactly where he wanted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question made Daren&#39;s smirk fade just a little,and he studied Sherwood&#39;s expression with wary calculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat passed as Daren drummed his fingers against the arm of the sofa, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he looked up, a sly glimmer returning to his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flashed a number with his fingers and replied in a voice that left no room for negotiation, &#34;I hear you loud and clear. The Sampson family is a force to be reckoned with, and I&#39;d like nothing more than to work with them long-term. But these days, every move  comes with more eyes watching, and we both know the risks aren&#39;t getting smaller. For this kind of shipment, that&#39;s the lowest I&#39;ll go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s face didn&#39;t betray a thing. In truth, he was willing to pay whatever it took to make sure Luis fell into his trap. But for now, he kept up the act, playing the loyal agent to perfection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s brow furrowed as if he&#39;d just swallowed something bitter, a shadow of uncertainty flickering in his eyes. His hesitation hung in the air, every muscle in his face telegraphing reluctance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept silent for a moment, and then finally met Daren&#39;s gaze. &#34;That&#39;s a steep figure, Daren. The Sampson family isn&#39;t reckless with their money, no matter how deep their pockets go. Every deal gets scrutinized, every penny accounted for. How about cutting us a break on the price? Show some goodwill now, and you&#39;ll have a powerful ally for the future.When the next opportunity comes up, you&#39;ll be the first we call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to sound reasonable, Sherwood pressed his advantage. Daren&#39;s smile stayed in place, but a sharp edge crept into his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reclining farther into the couch, Daren flicked his cigar ash to the floor and let the silence linger. &#34;Mr. Kirk,&#34; he said,keeping his voice steady but steely,&#34;the rate I&#39;m offering is more than fair,considering the climate we&#39;re working in. The authorities are watching everything and making my job a headache. Pulling these strings cost me, and I took on plenty of risks getting this order together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened, voice losing any hint of playfulness.&#34;You might be the face of the Sampson family,but my reputation is everything in this business. If I&#39;m seen folding on prices, no one will take me seriously again.I have to draw the line somewhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment passed as Daren searched Sherwood&#39;s face for any sign of wavering. &#34;There&#39;s nothing left to negotiate. I can&#39;t budge on the number.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Sherwood caught sight of Daren&#39;s unyielding posture,he recognized the signal. The performance was nearing its end, and dragging it out any longer would only raise suspicion and invite trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight crease formed between his brows as hesitation settled across his face, the kind that revealed a quiet resistance he wasn&#39;t ready to voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a resigned shake of his head, he finally spoke.&#34;If that&#39;s your answer, then I suppose we have to make do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a new tack, not missing a moment. &#34;Still, a transaction of this size deserves some flexibility. The Sampson family is ordering in bulk, and we&#39;ll need more soon. Let&#39;s talk payment terms. We&#39;ll start with a deposit. Once everything arrives at the drop and passes inspection, the rest will be paid in full. That&#39;s only fair,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daren&#39;s eyes narrowed,suspicion clouding his features for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed quiet for a moment, and then managed a forced smile. His tone held steady, though there was a faint trace of reluctance beneath it. &#34;I&#39;ll admit your request seems fair on the surface. But think about this.We&#39;re dealing with a high volume of goods, and keeping that supply moving without interruption is already proving difficult.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Daren spoke, he gave a slight shake of his head.&#34;The upfront cost on my side-manpower, supplies,and money-isn&#39;t something I can brush off. With what you&#39;re asking, if anything slips out of place, I&#39;ll be the one left picking up the pieces.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill settled over Sherwood&#39;s features, his eyes narrowing as he replied with unmistakable frost,&#34;Daren, are you really doubting my word, or the Sampson family&#39;s name? Have you forgotten who l am to them?&#34; He leaned in, elbows on his knees, never breaking eye contact. &#34;Luis is about to marry my daughter. I&#39;m not just a friend to the Sampson family. My place in their circle is secure. With the family&#39;s influence in Ochrerayd, do you honestly believe someone as wealthy as Luis would risk defaulting over a payment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A calming nod from Daren followed, but the sly glimmer in his eyes gave away his suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifted in his seat, pretending to wrestle with the idea, and answered, &#34;Mr. Kirk, no one in their right mind would question your reputation or the Sampson family&#39;s power. Everyone respects what they&#39;ve built.Still, you know how it is in our line of work; being careful is just survival.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out a sigh, Daren ran a hand through his hair,worry lining his face. &#34;We&#39;re talking about a shipment that could make or break my entire business. If anything goes wrong, I lose everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated before adding, &#34;It&#39;s not about trust. It&#39;s about making sure every detail is airtight. For something this important, I&#39;d feel better calling Luis Sampson directly to confirm the payment arrangements. That should settle any doubts, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Daren&#39;s response, Sherwood could only sigh inwardly, recognizing the man&#39;s skill at maneuvering through shady deals. Even when Daren acted humble, he missed nothing and left no loopholes.</p>
