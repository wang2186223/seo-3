                <p>Verena made no effort to lower her tone; instead, she deliberately raised it a few notches, ensuring that every guest present caught her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even those who hadn&#39;t been paying attention quickly had the message whispered into their ears, one after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her words reached them, the guests halted their conversations, curiosity stirring like ripples on water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling all eyes upon her and Alec, Laura&#39;s face drained of color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her mnouth in panic, trying to defend herself.&#34;My sweet girl, it&#39;s notwhat you think. We only came here to celebrate...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s cold voice sliced through her plea. &#34;Don&#39;t call me that. It&#39;s revolting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze was frigid, void of warmth. &#34;As you once looked down on me, so I now look at you. I once craved a mother&#39;s affection, but all  see before me is a failed mother-one who could not even protect her daughters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura stood there in shock, speechless, while Verena pressed on, her words sharp as thorns. &#34;I envied Kaia&#39;s place, and she feared I would take it from her. But the truth is plain: we&#39;ve come to this point because of you both. You&#39;re the true culprits, unworthy of the title of parents. What&#39;s lost cannot be reclaimed. Don&#39;t deceive yourselves into thinking you can mend it. The hourglass has already run out. My only wish now is that you stay far from my life and let me live my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Verena turned decisively and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her feelings toward Kaia were knotted with both aversion and regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, no child was born evil. Yet a single good deed could not erase Kaia&#39;s past cruelty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Verena hadn&#39;t once saved her under the name Evelyn, Kaia would never have awakened to her mistakes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the heavier blame fell on Alec and Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing up in such a household was Kaia&#39;s lifelong misfortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s tone had been resolute, her words piercing like blades, leaving Alec and Laura no room to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humiliated before so many guests, their pride crumbled into dust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shame weighed heavily, but alongside it came a tide of regret they could not put into words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting moment, both seemed utterly drained of strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura was tangled in a storm of emotions, replaying Verena&#39;s words, while Alec sank into remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally opened his mouth, his voice hoarse. &#34;Verena, Verena...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura too tried desperately to salvage the situation, calling after her, &#34;Verena, don&#39;t treat us this way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before they could catch up, several tall bodyguards strode in under the stunned eyes of the guests</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With swift efficiency, they escorted Alec and Laura out, ignoring their protests and pleas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their figures were soon swallowed by the hall&#39;s entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence descended over the hall. Guests exchanged glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, whispers began to spread like sparks in dry grass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d heard rumors that the Willis couple never cared for their eldest daughter, but I didn&#39;t think it was true,&#34;0woman in an elegant gown murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not just neglect. Didn&#39;t you hear? Verena was so wounded she severed ties completely,&#34; a man in a gray suit whispered back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Judging,from her words, she has no intention. of reconciling with the Willis family. And rightly so-some parents deserve such a cutting response111another guest remarked, admiration flickering in his tone. Everyone present now understood exactly where Verena stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that moment onward, few would accept an invitation from Willis Group without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena slipped into the lounge, and Isaac soon followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood with her arms folded, gazing out the window, her eyes distant, so lost in thought she didn&#39;t even hear him enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her slender back, Isaac&#39;s heart ached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were supposed to rest. Why are you still standing?&#34; he asked softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena turned at his voice, a faint smile tugging at her lips, before walking over to sit on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac wheeled himself closer, took her hand gently, and said with steady warmth, &#34;Don&#39;t be sad. You did the right thing. Don&#39;t torment yourself with thoughts. You still have me, and I&#39;ll always remain by your side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing, his gaze softened as his other hand brushed over her abdomen.&#34;And now, there&#39;s the baby too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The baby and I will protect you together.&#34;	分</p>
                
                
                
                <p>4Verena&#39;s lashes quivered, her nose tingling with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she not be moved?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She too was human, with longings and wounds. Like any child, she had once dreamed of curling into her parents&#39; embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She even remembered the tenderness Alec and Laura once showed-before Kaia was born.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But wealth and power had a way of twisting hearts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena shook her head gently. &#34;I&#39;m not sad for them. I only feel it wasn&#39;t worth it-for myself, and for my grandmother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stubborn resilience carried a quiet dignity that stirred sympathy. Isaac lowered his gaze, his throat tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,without a word, he leaned down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his cool fingers brushed her ankle, Verena instinctively flinched back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him in surprise. &#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Taking off your shoes, to massage your feet,&#34; he replied simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lowered her eyes. Strictly speaking, pregnancy made heels unwise, but the gown demanded some height, so she had chosen block heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t high, but standing so long had left her feet aching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t noticed until now, but as soon as he mentioned it, the discomfort surfaced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t expected him to notice so keenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth welled in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Isaac slipped off her shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her feet were delicate, her toes smooth and neat; they could have easily graced a model&#39;s catalogue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac rested her foot on his lap, his fingers pressing lightly, applying just the right pressure to ease her ankle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression was intent, wholly focused on her comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him, Verena&#39;s lips curved into a soft smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out, stroked his hair gently, and whispered, &#34;My husband is truly good to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s hand paused briefly before he smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting his eyes, he looked at her, his gazeglimmering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she had called him that before, the words still made his heart flutter. After some time in the lounge, Verena wanted to take a look at her new hospital. Isaac clasped her hand firmly. &#34;I&#39;ll go with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hospital was close-barely ten minutes&#39; drive from the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside,Verena carefully pushed Isaac along the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She checked each room in detail, ensuring everythning was in order, before heading straight to the operating theater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The advanced equipment gleamed under the lights, the pristine atmosphere commanding respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena knelt before Isaac, her voice tender.&#34;Isaac, all the preparations are complete. I can schedule your surgery for tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, joy flickered in his eyes, yet his brow soon furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze drifted to her still-flat stomach, and he sad gently,&#34;There&#39;s no hurry. You&#39;re carrying our child now; don&#39;t exhaust yourself. The surgery can wait. Your health matters most.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Isaac yearned for the day he could walk again, compared to Verena&#39;s well-being, the dream suddenly seemed less urgent.</p>
