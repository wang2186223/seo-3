                <p>As Katelyn collapsed unconscious, officers surged forward, snapping cuffs around her wrists, ready to haul her toward the waiting police car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the crack of three gunshots sent lsaac reeling. His voice was tight with urgency as he ordered Jacob to push him into the factory at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his eyes found Verena standing safe and unscathed, a heavy breath of relief escaped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob stopped the chair in front of her, and Isaac&#39;s gaze swept her from head to toe, searching for the slightest injury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he was certain she was unharmed,he clutched her hand with a desperate strength and lifted his other hand to her face, brushing her cheek as fear clouded his expression. &#34;That was reckless,&#34; he said hoarsely. &#34;Promise me you&#39;ll never throw yourself into danger like that again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words trembled with genuine terror-he had lived through the longest minutes of his life waiting outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with police and bodyguards positioned all around the factory, dread had clawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when those gunshots rang out, knowing she was still inside, the thought of losing her nearly broke him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cursed himself silently for ever letting her take the risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes, usually so composed, now brimmed with an emotion he struggled to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena read the storm in his gaze. She pressed her palm against the hand on her cheek, her smile gentle but unwavering. &#34;Some chances can&#39;t be wasted,Isaac. If I hadn&#39;t gone through with this, we never  would&#39;ve uncovered the full scope of Katelyn&#39;s crimes. The more evidence exposed, the harsher her punishment will be. And when that time comes, not even the Fuller family&#39;s power will be enough to save her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she had a point, Isaac couldn&#39;t shake the fear gnawing at him-he should never have let her take such a gamble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The outcome had been in their favor, but the thought of what might have gone wrong sent a cold dread through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He forced the images away, unwilling to imagine a world where she hadn&#39;t walked out unharmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After steadying himself, he fixed his gaze on her,brows drawn, and his voice softened. &#34;Does your head ache?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena blinked in surprise before realizing what he meant. He was thinking of the strike Elmore had landed on her earlier. Of course, Isaac had to know the truth-that Elmore had been bribed, and the blow had been little more than theater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the concern in his eyes was genuine,his question sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tenderness in his expression warmed her in a way she hadn&#39;t expected. Smiling, she shook her head and answered, &#34;He barely touched me. It didn&#39;t hurt at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed through Isaac at her reassurance, the tension easing from his shoulders at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s gaze shifted briefly across the factory-Katelyn&#39;s allies were already shackled, marched out one by one by uniformed officers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn, still unconscious, was being lifted to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Justice had caught up to the guilty at last, and the chaos that had plagued them seemed to draw to a close. For the first time in what felt like forever, Verena allowed herself to wish for a quieter life beyond the turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing her focus back to the man before her,she lowered herself to his level, her fingers slipping around his hands with tender certainty. &#34;Isaac, the obstacles that stood between us are gone now. I can finally start preparing for your surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The possibility of surgery so close at hand left Isaac momentarily stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope flickered in his eyes, slowly rising until it lit his entire expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this mean he was finally a step closer to living like any other man?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought alone sent a rush of joy through him,stirring emotions he could barely contain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rare smile tugged at his lips, his eyes glimmering with anticipation. His voice came rough, weighed down by the effort of holding back his excitement. &#34;Good. I&#39;ll wait for you. For now... let&#39;s go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Verena replied with a gentle smile, her warmth shining through her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rose to her feet and began pushing his wheelchair toward the doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as they moved past Katelyn, Verena&#39;s gaze strayed to the side. Her brows pinched together instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier she had felt nothing, but the moment her eyes landed on Katelyn, the scene struck her hard. Blood slicked down the woman&#39;s arm, dripping into a dark pool beneath her, the red mingling with dust and shards of debris as officers hauled her to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grisly sight twisted Verena&#39;s stomach, a sharp nausea rising like a wave she couldn&#39;t push back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her throat burned with bitterness, the taste of bile forcing her to freeze mid-step behind Isaac&#39;s chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body folded forward against her will, one arm clutching her stomach while the other pressed against her chest as if to hold herself steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh-&#34; The sound broke from her as she gagged,retching dryly again and again. Color rushed to her cheeks, her skin flushed crimson as the violent heaving left her breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of her gagging made Isaac whip his head around, his gaze tightening with alarm. &#34;What&#39;s happening? Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena pressed a hand over her chest, her face red but resolute. She forced a faint shake of her head.&#34;It&#39;s nothing serious. Let&#39;s just go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air inside the abandoned factory had been thick with dust, clinging to their clothes and hair. By the time they returned to Seraphina Villas, Verena headed straight for the shower, washing away the grime of the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she stepped out wrapped in fresh clothes,Isaac wheeled himself into the bathroom to do the  same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone in the quiet bedroom, Verena drifted toward the wide floor-to-ceiling window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crossed her arms, her eyes fixed on the sky beyond, distant and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long while she stood there in silence, her thoughts a current only she could follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, she reached for her phone and dialed a familiar number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelyn,&#34; came Julianna&#39;s respectful voice as she answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena wasted no time on greetings, her tone brisk and decisive. &#34;Julianna, I need you to take care of something for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;P&#39;ll handle it,&#34; Julianna replied promptly. &#34;What are your instructions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; Verena replied. &#34;Reach out to every major media outlet. Tomorrow I&#39;ll be holding a press conference. The purpose will be to announce the relocation of the overseas hospital to Akoitha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no hesitation on Julianna&#39;s end, only efficient compliance. &#34;Understood. I&#39;ll notify the press immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s tone softened as she closed out the call.&#34;I appreciate your.effort,Julianna. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went dead, but before she could set her phone aside, it lit up with an incoming call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved into a faint smile when she saw the name on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miranda. To what do I owe the honor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An exasperated voice shot back instantly. &#34;Are you insane? You actually revealed to the world that you&#39;re Evelyn? Something this huge, and you just blurt it out in front of the media? Do you have any idea the kind of storm you&#39;ve kicked up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda had been drowning in work lately, too consumed by deadlines to keep up with headlines.  Only that morning, while scrolling through international coverage, had she nearly dropped her coffee when she saw Verena&#39;s face. The reports confirmed everything-Verena had traveled to Clokron days earlier and performed surgery on the chairman of Smoothdeed Group, saving his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what stunned Miranda most was that Verena hadn&#39;t hidden behind her alias. She had announced,publicly and without hesitation, that she was Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revelation had made Miranda lose control in her office, her voice rising in disbelief until she remembered the walls were soundproof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had anyone overheard, the cool, decisive image she cultivated as a businesswoman would have shattered on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After watching the replay of the interview in disbelief,she dialed Verena repeatedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every attempt had failed-until now. This time, she finally got through.Miranda&#39;s voice climbed in frustration, her words carrying more edge than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena tilted her head slightly, easing the phone away from her ear with a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why so riled up? Isn&#39;t this a good thing? I can&#39;t live behind a mask forever, can l?&#34; she teased lightly before letting her tone fall into something steadier.&#34;Katelyn was only one case. Who knows how many more are exploiting my name to trick patients? By stepping forward, I cut off their lies before more people suffer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Miranda didn&#39;t care about frauds or strangers-her worry was for Verena alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you see what you&#39;ve done? This is the same as painting a target on your back.&#34; Her voice softened, though the weight of concern pressed through. &#34;You already know there are plenty of people out there who&#39;d love to hurt you. Now that everyone knows who you really are, you&#39;ve made yourself more vulnerable than ever.&#34; The woman who usually laughed her way through problems now sounded grave, her words heavy with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena felt a warmth stir in her chest at the depth of her friend&#39;s concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miranda, do you know why I chose now to reveal the truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Miranda asked quickly, her voice still tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s gaze wandered to the world beyond the tall windows, her thoughts spilling into words. &#34;In Clokron, I built countless connections, yet I never dared to reveal myself. I knew too well that most people are swayed by greed. That&#39;s why, aside from you and Gavin, I kept it from everyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a thoughtful pause, Verena&#39;s lips curved slightly. &#34;But things aren&#39;t the same anymore. I have Isaac now. With the Bennett family&#39;s influence in Akoitha, they&#39;re practically treated like royalty.Anyone thinking of crossing me would have to weigh the cost carefully.&#34; Her words carried a quiet joy, laced with steady conviction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s brows knitted together in doubt. &#34;You really place that much faith in lsaac? Aren&#39;t you worried he could turn on you someday?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s smile deepened, her voice calm and unwavering. &#34;He&#39;s my husband, Miranda. Trusting him isn&#39;t a choice-it&#39;s a certainty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bennett family&#39;s name alone stood untouchable in Akoitha, especially in Shoildon, the capital,their power beyond question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda sifted through every possibility, but no rival came to mind-no one had the means to oppose them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, she found herself admitting that Isaac was, indeed, a man worthy of Verena&#39;s lifelong trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relieved,she let her worries slip away with a sigh and quickly shifted her tone back to her usual teasing self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get it now. You&#39;ve found your knight in shining armor, and here I was wasting energy fretting over you.&#34;</p>
