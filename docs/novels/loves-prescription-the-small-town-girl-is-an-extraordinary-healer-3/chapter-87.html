                <p>A sharp clink rang out as Isaac&#39;s grip slipped, sending the glass tumbler toppling onto the coffee table with a noisy crash. Water splashed out, soaking into his trousers and leaving a dark, unmistakable patch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color rushed to Isaac&#39;s cheeks as he scrambled to retrieve the glass. He cleared his throat, pretending nothing was wrong, and answered Verena, &#34;N-no, that&#39;s alright. I&#39;ll take a bath on my own later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marriage paperwork might have been finished, but that did not make it easy for lsaac to let go of his self-doubt or bare his vulnerabilities so quickly, even for something as simple as a shared bath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house wNas quiet, which made it easy for Verena to catch every/bit of the scene outside the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A suspicion grew in her mind that lsaac had missed her meaning entirely, and she decided to have some fun with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving toward the bathroom door, she folded her arms and leaned against the frame. Her lips curled in a teasing smile as she watched him closely, her eyes bright and mischievous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac, the bath is ready. We just got married today, and you&#39;re already planning to leave me hanging? Isn&#39;t that just a little bit heartless?&#34; she said, her voice softening as she stretched out the last part like a playful complaint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the very beginning, Verena always seemed to know the perfect way to keep him off balance. That was what Isaac believed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac knew his own body&#39;s limits better than anyone. Even though Verena had seen the damage to his legs countless times, he still felt uneasy about letting her see all of him. There was more to it, too. Living with the reality of his condition, he dreaded the idea of exposing his physical shortcomings, especially when it came to intimacy. The thought only deepened his sense of shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac, come on, don&#39;t leave me waiting. The water is going to turn cold soon. Are you really going to let me shiver in here?&#34; Verena called out, her tone playful yet persistent. Refusing her seemed impossible, but Isaac wanted to protest. Looking up, he caught sight of her open expression and gentle concern in her eyes. In that moment, every argument vanished, and he realized there was no way he could turn her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac set his jaw, drawing in a breath for courage, and guided his wheelchair toward the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena caught sight of him coming closer, one eyebrow arching upward while her lips curled into a mischievous grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac rolled inside, the scent of herbs greeted him, sharp and comforting. Steam drifted above the bath,hinting at the heat within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Isaac stared in confusion, and then the truth dawned on him and his cheeks reddened in embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this for treatment?&#34; he asked, his voice quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter sparkled in Verena&#39;s eyes as she nodded, her face all wide-eyed innocence. &#34;Of course. What else did you think I asked you to comein here for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s ears burned as he pressed his lips together,staying silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amusement flickered in Verena&#39;s expression as she circled behind him, her arms slipping around his neck.Cool fingertips crept under his suit jacket, stopping at the first button of his shirt, playing with it teasingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle chill passed through the thin cotton and settled on Isaac&#39;s chest, sending his Adam&#39;s apple moving up and down as he swallowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every muscle in Isaac&#39;s body tensed, his neck stretching as he tried to block out the cold touch against his warm skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena leaned in close, her lips grazing the edge of his ear as she spoke with a light laugh in her voice.&#34;Surely you didn&#39;t think I invited you in here for something romantic, did you? Isaac, I just moved in, and you&#39;re already misbehaving?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first button was undone, and her hand inched further, starting to undo another button, but Isaac caught her hand and pulled her down so she landed squarely on his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough, Verena. You have to stop teasing me,&#34; he said, his breath growing heavier, voice low and warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, seeing his face flushed and serious, Verena softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her forehead rested gently against his as she whispered, &#34;You don&#39;t need to hold back, Isaac. Kiss me if you want. It&#39;ll help you heal, you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No explanation was needed. Isaac understood perfectly what she meant about his health.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s grip tightened around her wrist as he brought his other hand up to cradle the back of her head.Suddenly, he leaned in, his lips claiming hers in a kiss that started soft but quickly grew deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the bathroom was filled with the sound of their breathing, each moment more heated than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like ages, quiet settled around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breathing hard, Verena slumped against his shoulder, her mind spinning with disbelief. She had only told him not to hold back his feelings-she hadn&#39;t expected him to take her so literally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s arms slid around her waist, and he pressed a kiss to the top of her head, eyes lowered in affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she gathered herself, Verena moved to help Isaac out of his clothes, supporting him as she guided him into the waiting tub.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steam rose from the water, which was tinged with the rich brown color of medicinal herbs, hiding anything beneath the surface from view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That detail allowed Isaac a moment of relief, easing some of the self-consciousness he felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After soaking in the bath, heat colored Isaac&#39;s cheeks and sweat clung to his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lifted him gently, wrapping him in a soft robe as he reached for the wheels of his chair to leave.She placed a gentle hand on his arm to stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on, you&#39;re not done yet. The herbal bath is just the start. You need a massage next, and after that, a special treatment. Let&#39;s begin with your legs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a seat nearby, she loosened the robe and began working her hands over his legs, her fingers skillfully pressing and kneading each spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her touch moved up from his ankle, pausing at key points that might help his body heal and regain strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though his legs were numb, watching her careful, attentive movements made Isaac&#39;s throat tighten, his Adam&#39;s apple moving twice as he gripped the sides of the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat dotted his forehead by the end of the massage. Once finished, Verena rolled his chair toward the elevator and together they rode upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the doors opened, she glanced his way and asked, &#34;Which one is our room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her say &#34;our room&#34; sent a small shock through Isaac. The simple words made it clear-she had no plans for separate bedrooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle smile threatened to break through Isaac&#39;s tightly closed lips. Her words made it clear she had forgotten his warning from the very first day they met. Deciding not to bring it up, he chose to let it slip from his mind as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nod toward the far end of the hall signaled the answer. &#34;Our room is at the very end,&#34; he remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, walking just behind him, missed the way happiness flickered across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They entered together, and Verena moved quickly to help lsaac onto the bed before reaching into her medical kit for a set of needles, ready to begin the special therapy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the treatment, she checked in as always, asking him what he could feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As usual, Isaac shook his head. However, this time, with warmth lingering from the herbal soak, he failed to notice the faint burning that flickered through his legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the last needle was removed, Verena neatly packed away her tools.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac grabbed his phone. A glance at it revealed a long list of missed calls waiting on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The number surprised him-more than a dozen, and every one came from Bobby.Isaac&#39;s brow creased as he stared at the notifications</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening the chat app, he found message after message piled up from Bobby, nearly twenty in all. Each onerepeated the same thing: &#34;You and Dr. Willis got married!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pressed his lips together again, puzzled by Bobby&#39;s excitement over the news.Casting a look at Verena, lsaac&#39;s eyes danced with amusement as he typed his reply to Bobby, &#34;She&#39;s yoursister-in-law now. You&#39;d better get used to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby could hardly believe what he was reading. lsaac was clearly acting smug about itDeciding to push back, Bobby responded deliberately, &#34;Not happening.Two words summed up his rebellious mood. Only behind the safety of the screen could Bobby get away withthat attitude. Deep down, he knew his place-timid in person, but unexpectedly daring when hiding behind screen.</p>
