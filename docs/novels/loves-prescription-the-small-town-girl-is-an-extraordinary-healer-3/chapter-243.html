                <p>A lingering warmth filled the office,still echoing the intimacy they&#39;d just shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s face glowed with a blush as she slipped away from Isaac&#39;s embrace, her hair slightly mussed and lending her an easy, captivating charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spoke softly. &#34;You go ahead and finish your work.I&#39;ll be over here reading a magazine, so you won&#39;t be distracted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Isaac&#39;s eyes lingered on her with clear longing,considering her pregnancy, he knew he couldn&#39;t go any further now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a gentle nod.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena crossed to the sofa,picked up a magazine,and flipped through the pages in a relaxed way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac turned back to his paperwork, but every so often he looked over at her, watching the golden afternoon light surround her with a gentle glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being quietly waited for brought a warmth he hadn&#39;t expected. That thought made him smile to himself, eyes soft with affection as he gazed at Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, in one of Shoildon&#39;s upscale nightclubs, a hazy VIP room hummed with low lights and curling smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis lounged on a plush leather sofa, dressed sharply in a black suit, exuding effortless ease as he leaned back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers tapped out a steady rhythm on the armrest while a heavyset, middle-aged man beside him launched into a desperate plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man, all smiles and anxious bows, looked at Luis with hope and urgency. &#34;Mr. Sampson, please. Only you have the power to help me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words dripped with both flattery and desperation,as if Luis was the only chance left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis barely spared him a glance, his expression cold and uninterested, eyelids half-lowered in complete indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently swirled his wine, watching the deep red shimmer beneath the soft light. His voice was ice-cold when he finally replied, &#34;You want my help? What makes you think you deserve it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man looked ready to plead further, but Luis &#39; phone buzzed before he could speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One glance at the screen, and Luis gestured to his security team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting a second, they moved in and hauled the middle-aged man out with zero regard for formality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone else in the room got the message and slipped out in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone at last, Luis answered the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice on the line wasted no time with formalities.&#34;Mr. Sampson, our search revealed Simon recently returned from abroad and immediately took a job as a psychologist at Evelyn Model Hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That caught Luis&#39; interest. &#34;Evelyn Model Hospital?What draws him to that place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short pause, and then the report continued.&#34;It was considered the leading hospital in Clokron. The founder, Evelyn Rowe, gained fame for taking on tough surgeries at a young age and has built a reputation for medical breakthroughs. Most of the hospital&#39;s prestige is thanks to her. Powerful business leaders in Clokron hold her in high regard. The hospital only relocated to Akoitha not long ago.Since Simon studied medicine, it&#39;s possible he looks up to Evelyn. She&#39;s a big name in the industry, and admiration isn&#39;t out of the question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis leaned back, quietly rubbing his chin as he mulled it over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For all his experience reading people, Luis doubted someone as secretive and ruthless as Simon truly idolized anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wanting to get close to Evelyn had to mean Simon was chasing after something important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The low light caught the glint in Luis&#39; eyes as the thought struck him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible Simon&#39;s real target was Evelyn herself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With new suspicion, Luis asked, &#34;Do you know what Evelyn looks like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His assistant answered right away, &#34;You&#39;ll find plenty if you search &#39;Evelyn Rowe&#39; online, sir. There are even clips of her speaking at press conferences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking the advice, Luis hung up and looked up Evelyn&#39;s name. The results flooded in instantly, with article after article covering her story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the top, two videos stood out: one where Evelyn revealed her identity during the Fairclough family&#39;s press conference in Clokron, and the other showing her cutting the ribbon at her hospital&#39;s grand opening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clicked one of the videos at random,but what he saw made him freeze in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman on the screen was the same one who had given him a lift days before, and the same woman he&#39;d seen at Isaac&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis muttered to himself, &#34;Her again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It truly was a small world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, a mysterious smile curled across his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked to a search suggestion beneath the video: &#34;Bennett Group CEO&#39;s Wife, Verena Wilis,Revealed as Dr. Evelyn Rowe,the Legendary Surgeon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name Verena caught his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis narrowed his eyes, realizing the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she really was Isaac&#39;s wife. With that revelation, the puzzle pieces finally clicked into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s complicated schemes to target lsaac had nothing to do with chasing power or wealth-they were all for this woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena. That was her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis let out a quiet, mocking laugh, his eyes growing cold as ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon had tried to use his sister to manipulate him into going against Bennett Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,Luis realized he could turn the tables, using Verena as leverage against Simon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Simon had it right-Luis was never one to back down when he set his sights on something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this new angle, Luis was certain he would find his sister soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside Evelyn Model Hospital, the hallways remained calm as nurses and doctors quietly carried out their tasks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that calm didn&#39;t last-within moments, a sudden noise tore through the stillness. A towering figure swept into the hospital, his black trench coat trailing behind him and his eyes sharp with intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was none other than Luis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked right up to the nurses&#39; station, hands buried in his pockets and chin tilted up, barely sparing them a glance. &#34;I&#39;m not feeling well. Go fetch your top doctor-Evelyn. I want her to see me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurses glanced nervously at eachother,unsettled by his intimidating aura but still mindful of their responsibilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One nurse stepped forward, her voice hesitant. &#34;Sir,you&#39;ll need to fill out a registration form first and wait your turn...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; patience snapped. &#34;Stop wasting time. Just get her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurses fumbled for a response, never having dealt with anyone quite as stubborn or striking as this man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief swept through them as Julianna came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly, they flagged her down and filled her in on the situation. After listening, Julianna recognized his type right away.People like this didn&#39;t respond to force, and strog-arming him would only make things worse</p>
