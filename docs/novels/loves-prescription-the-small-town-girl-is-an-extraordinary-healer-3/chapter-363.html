                <p>&#34;Howe, since you&#39;ve started confessing, I want the entire truth-every detail,&#34; Verena said,her stare cold and unflinching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe&#39;s hand shook as he wiped sweat from his brow.&#34;Sherwood called me into his office one afternoon.Once the door shut, he speled everything out. He slid a photograph of you across the desk and told me if l made you disappear, the rewards he promised would be mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He faltered, searching for the nerve to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s voice cut through the silence. &#34;Don&#39;t stall. Tell us exactly how you pulled it off.&#34; His eyes narrowed,glintingwith suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long gulp, Howe added, looking at Verena,&#34;Back then, I&#39;d studied the hospital&#39;s layout and memorized the nurses&#39; rotation schedule. On the third night after you were born, I dressed as a member of the staff and used forged identification to slip into the maternity ward without raising suspicion. Your mother was resting alone in the room when I arrived. I walked up to the crib, lifted you into my arms, and wrapped  you carefully in a blanket I&#39;d brought with me.Without hesitation, I carried you out and left the room behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s voice cracked through the room, raw with anger. &#34;Did you really think you could get away with that? What about the cameras? The security?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The accusation sent a shiver through Howe. He struggled to steady his voice. &#34;Sherwood thought of everything. He paid off the chief of security to cut the cameras near the ward right before I went in. He even set up a getaway car waiting at the back exit. The second I left the building, I got into that car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s tone was razor-sharp. &#34;What happened after that? What exactly did Sherwood intend for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe&#39;s eyes dropped to the floor, his voice barely more than a whisper. &#34;After I took you, I followed Sherwood&#39;s orders and drove out to a remote village I thought my part would end once I handed you off.But things started falling apart. The contact who was supposed to take you vanished, wouldn&#39;t answer any calls. I panicked and phoned Sherwood. He lost his temper and told me to clean up the mess myself. He even said... if there was no way out, I could get rid of you for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the words left his lips, his hands shook. Fear and shame flickered across his face. &#34;I couldn&#39;t bring  myself to do it. No matter how desperate I got,you were just a baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fora split second, regret flashed in his eyes, but the darkness of old choices swallowed it quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I scrambled for another way out. I remembered an old friend who had ties with several maternity hospitals, so I got the contacts from my friend, and then ordered my men to reach out and see if anyone could help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe&#39;s gaze flickered to lsaac and Verena, catching the storm brewing in their expressions. He quickly looked away,voice even softer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It just so happened there was a hospital where a woman collapsed during childbirth, and her newborn didn&#39;t make it. I grabbed the chance and told Sherwood right away. He said to bring you over immediately. He would line up the surgeon to smooth things over. I hurried you to the hospital, and everything went off just as Sherwood wanted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His throat felt like sandpaper as he swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Howe finally glanced up again, his voice came out rough and small. &#34;That couple... they never found out their own baby was gone before you took her place.&#34;</p>
