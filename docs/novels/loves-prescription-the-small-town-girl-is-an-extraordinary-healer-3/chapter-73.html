                <p>Gavin&#39;s words sliced through lsaac&#39;s chest like a thousand unseen blades, as though each syllable tried to pierce the very core of his heart. Jealousy swelled inside him, a black hole swallowing the last fragments of reason, leaving only darkness in its wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac fixed his eyes on Gavin, his memory sharp as ever. Even beneath the bruises that marred Gavin&#39;s face, he recognized him-the same man who had once sat across from Verena at Fortune Garden Restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just friends? The thought rang hollow. Could such closeness truly be brushed off as mere friendship?Ha-people often doubted whether men and women could walk that line without stumbling. Now, the answer seemed clear: no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Isaac could not untangle the truth in Gavin&#39;s words, Bobby&#39;s account of Gavin&#39;s earlier behavior toward Verena was already more than enough to inflame him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes blazed with jealousy and deep-rooted anger, a storm begging to be unleashed on Gavin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bitterness, regret, envy-one after another, the feelings circled him like vultures, tearing at his sanity without rest. His sharply cut jaw clenched tight, and his gaze gleamed with the ferocity of a predator,coiled and ready to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice struck like ice against steel as he demanded, &#34;Who gave you permission to touch her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin flinched beneath that piercing gaze, fear chilling him for a heartbeat before his easy mask returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed lightly, feigning ease, tilting his head in mock amusement. &#34;Ah, Mr. Bennett, you have quite the sense of humor. Didn&#39;t you turn Dr. Willis away yourself? Or are you forbidding her from developing feelings for someone else?&#34; Developing feelings?&#34; Isaac echoed, teeth clenched, his face clouding like a storm on the horizon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin, savoring the chaos, decided to pour oil onto the flames. &#34;Truth be told, I&#39;ve admired Dr. Willis for quite some time. She isn&#39;t only beautiful-her mind and skill are rare treasures. Now that she&#39;s said she&#39;s single, tell me, what man wouldn&#39;t seize such a chance? Don&#39;t you think so, Mr. Bennett?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word Gavin spoke was a spark to lsaac&#39;s fury.His eyes narrowed, cold as frost. This man knew his surname-his very identity. That could only mean Verena had spoken of him. But what had she said?That he had driven her away step by step? That he had rejected her until she stood alone, ripe for another&#39;s pursuit?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lowered his gaze, fury shadowing his brow, but sorrow weighing heavier. That little deceiver-only hours ago she had promised to wait, to give him time. Yet within the span of a night, she called herself single to another man. Isaac suspected Verena had done it on purpose. She was a sly fox, skilled in the art of reverse psychology,weaving snares with calculated ease. And yet, he had walked into her trap willingly-for the mere thought of it being true was a burden too heavy to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Verena had rinsed her face after vomiting and stepped out of the restroom, only to find Gavin restrained by a burly man. Before she could ask,Gavin&#39;s mocking words floated to her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows drew together in mild annoyance. What nonsense was he spouting this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved closer, nudging him lightly on the arm.&#34;What exactly are you rambling about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard by her return, Gavin&#39;s face twisted as if his good intentions were being misread.Leaning close, he whispered, &#34;Don&#39;t spoil it. I&#39;m helping you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still lightheaded, Verena tilted her head, murmuring back, &#34;Helping me with what, exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They bent toward each other, whispers passing between them, their closeness resembling cO- conspirators plotting a secret pact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a short distance, Isaac&#39;s hand clamped the armrest so hard that his knuckles cracked audibly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That nearness-heads brushing, hair mingling-drove him to the edge. Jealousy slithered through his chest like venom, slow yet merciless, pushing him toward the brink of collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fought to hold back the rising tide of fury, his voice finally breaking the tension-low, steady, and edged with fire. &#34;Verena.&#34;</p>
