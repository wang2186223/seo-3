                <p>Katelyn&#39;s arrest spread across Shoildon like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the daughter of a powerful businessman, her fal from grace was scandal enough, but the charges-hiring hitmen and plotting murder-set the city ablaze with attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What made the case explode further was her target:the wife of the Bennett heir, and the famed healer Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The police wasted no time. Their public relations team contacted the media directly, releasing the evidence and laying bare every detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within half a day, the motives, the methods, and the accomplices were splashed across headlines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to make an example of her, authorities positioned the case as a warning, and it dominated the morning news cycle. Shockwaves rippled through every corner of society.This wasn&#39;t just whispered among elites-it became open discussion on the streets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online, the uproar was even louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One stunned user posted, &#34;Am I reading this right?Katelyn actually tried to kidnap and murder someone. Did she really think her family&#39;s name would shield her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another retorted, &#34;Nobody stands above the law. Not the rich, not the royals. Break it, and you pay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And a third chimed in, commenting, &#34;I thought she was just a spoiled brat leading a promiscuous life.Turns out she&#39;s a straight-up criminal. Finally, justice served!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The final comment ignited a storm of replies across the internet. Some argued Katelyn would never be able to slip past the law, while others cynically pointed to past scandals where wealth and influence allowed criminals to walk free. The thread grew more volatile, emotions boiling over as sides clashed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, a cooler voice broke through the noise.&#34;Calm down, everyone. The evidence against her is airtight -there&#39;s no way she&#39;s walking away from this. And don&#39;t forget who she targeted. Verena is married to the future chairman of Bennett Group, and Evelyn&#39;s reputation as a healer is legendary. No one in their right mind would dare cover for Katelyn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That reasoning settled the argument quickly,silencing both skeptics and defenders alike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From there, the discussion took a new direction,focusing on why Katelyn had gone so far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;High society is rotten-fraud, abductions, murder.Nothing surprises me anymore. People have said for years that Katelyn was obsessed with Isaac. Looks like the jealousy over Verena being with him openly drove her over the edge. She&#39;s completely unhinged.&#34; &#34;At least she failed. If she&#39;d actually pulled it off,justice would&#39;ve been a joke.&#34; The online chatter raged on, but in another corner of the city, Danica had just woken and switched on the morning news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen flashed with footage of Katelyn lunging at Verena with a knife, followed by clips of her ranting like a woman unhinged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica stared, stunned into silence, her mind reeling long after the broadcast ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sank back into the sofa, her eyes wide with shock,her chest heavy with regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sheer depth of Katelyn&#39;s madness was beyond anything she had ever allowed herself to believe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of how close Verena had come to death made her grip the armrests until her knuckles whitened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always known Katelyn was unpredictable,but never in her worst fears had she imagined this level of cruelty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories rushed back-how she had let herself be manipulated, lashing out at Verena with cutting words and cold indifference, all because of Katelyn&#39;s poison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When international news first revealed that Verena was actually Evelyn, Danica had seen the truth laid bare. Yet pride and stubbornness had kept her from acknowledging it fully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking back now, she felt nothing but shame for allowing herself to be played so easily, for letting her relationship with Verena shatter over lies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after she finally knew the truth, she had clung to her pride, too proud to extend a hand, too proud to admit her fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, regret gnawed at her, heavy and merciless, for the suffering Verena had endured at Katelyn&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she could turn back time, Danica would have stood by Verena without hesitation, shutting out the poisonous whispers of others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But time didn&#39;t bend to regret. What was done was unchangeable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she had left was the choice to make things right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s brows drew together as she sank deeper into thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She resolved then and there to find a way to apologize to Verena with sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t expect forgiveness overnight-but perhaps it would quiet the guilt gnawing inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At ten o&#39;clock sharp, Verena&#39;s press conference was scheduled to begin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reporters had filled the hall early, equipment ready,questions rehearsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameras clicked into place, microphones tested,anticipation building like a hum in the air. &#34;She&#39;s here! She&#39;s here!&#34; someone whispered, and instantly every head turned toward the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A figure in a khaki coat walked out, her posture elegant, her slightly wavy hair cascading down her back like a sheet of silk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was striking-refined features, luminous skin, and eyes so bright they seemed to hold light of their own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For many reporters, it was their first time seeing Verena in person, and her beauty stunned them. But it was her quiet strengthn that truly held the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stepped to the podium with poise, a soft smile curving her lips as she inclined her head in greeting. &#34;Good morning, everyone. I trust you all already have an idea why I called this press conference.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried a quiet elegance, delicate yet steady, drawing the room into her rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite their awe at finally seeing the elusive figure in person, the reporters remained focused, aware that today&#39;s announcement would ripple across the medical world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today&#39;s announcement carried weight-Verena was set to reveal the relocation of her world-renowned hospital back to Akoitha, a headline no reporter dared miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One journalist leaned forward eagerly. &#34;Mrs. Bennett -or can I call you Evelyn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile was warm but measured.11Ofcourse.Either is fine with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The follow-up came quickly. &#34;Evelyn, can you confirm whether the hospital will indeed be moved to Akoitha? And if so, when will it happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing her lips together for a moment, Verena answered with clarity and poise, &#34;The plan to relocate has been in discussion for some time. Today I&#39;m making it official. As for when-it won&#39;t be long before this vision becomes reality.&#34; Another reporter raised their voice above the clicking of cameras. &#34;Evelyn, your hospital is known for offering free care to underprivileged patients overseas. After the move, will this practice continue here at home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s reply came without hesitation, her tone steady yet full of conviction. &#34;Of course. To me,every life carries the same weight, and everyone deserves the chance to live. But reality is crueler to the poor. They&#39;re the ones who struggle most to even see a doctor-that is their misfortune. So wherever my hospital is, my promise remains.We&#39;ll continue providing treatment to those who truly cannot afford it. But let me be clear, free care isn&#39;t for those who have the means but simply don&#39;t want to spend. A hospital isn&#39;t a charity. That&#39;s why we have a team dedicated to carefully verifying every case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were clear, compassionate, but firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena wasn&#39;t naive. She offered mercy, but never at the cost of fairness. The policy drew a line: only the truly helpless would receive free treatment, while those with resources would shoulder their own responsibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moved by her stance, the reporters broke into applause, the room filling with the sound of respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the very back, a young man stood silently, his presence almost overlooked. Gold-rimmed glasses framed his refined features, lending him an air of restraint and intellect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the others clapped, he remained still, his hands tucked into his pockets, his eyes locked on the striking woman at the podium. The intensity in his gaze carried words he barely whispered, &#34;Evelyn, I&#39;ve come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his voice was drowned beneath the wave of applause,swallowed by the noise that celebrated her resolve.</p>
