                <p>Luis narrowed his eyes, the veins at his neck throbbing as though anger itself pulsed through them. &#34;So you forged a birth certificate to aid and abet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bohumil gave a silent nod, his head sinking as if the weight of the world pressed upon it. &#34;Later, I followed their orders and resigned, hiding on the outskirts of the city to open a small clinic. On the fifteenth of every month, Howe would send me some money...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every word, his voice ebbed away, softer and weaker,heavy with resignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis no longer spared him a glance. His gaze shifted instead to Reginald, strung up in the air like a marionette without strings of his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He unfastened the cuff of his suit jacket, revealing a silver watch that gleamed coldly beneath the harsh white light. His tone cut through the silence like steel.&#34;And you? Aren&#39;t you going to confess?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question had barely left his lips when Reginald&#39;s inverted body thrashed violently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bohumil&#39;s confession had been a spark in dry tinder,  and Reginald&#39;s buried fury roared to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood rushed to his face, swelling it into something grotesque,his eyes red and near to bursting. &#34;Bohumil,you traitor!&#34; he howled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis stepped closer, producing a yellowed photograph from his pocket. It showed Reginald&#39;s son, radiant and proud, receiving an award at an international piano competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A prodigy, was he?&#34; Luis&#39; finger traced the photo&#39;s edge as a bitter smile curved his lips.&#34;And yet I heard hisleft pinky was severed more than twenty years ago?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words struck Reginald like a hammer blow,leaving him rigid and mute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A broken whimper escaped his throat, and the defiance in his eyes collapsed into dust. &#34;It was Sherwood... he forced me!&#34; he gasped. &#34;After I helped Howe,Sherwood ambushed me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding his teeth, he pressed on. &#34;He said I knew too much-either take three million and vanish, or...&#34; His voice cracked.&#34;He clamped my son&#39;s hand with pliers right before my eyes. He swore if I dared to speak a word,he would cut off all ten fingers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory dragged Reginald back into that nightmare: Sherwood&#39;s smile cold as ice, his son tied to a chair, staring with hopeless eyes. When Sherwood first demanded that he sink to the life of a truck driver, Reginald could not bear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the slightest hint of resistance was enough.Sherwood severed his son&#39;s pinky without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reginald&#39;s face burned crimson, his voice thick and heavy. &#34;I had no choice but to yield. I changed my name and went into hiding. For over twenty years, I&#39;ve been driving freight, nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; expression shifted, a storm of emotions flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,most of the truth had surfaced, yet his hatred for Sherwood burned hotter than ever in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenched his jaw, forcing his fury into silence.He knew these two were only pawns on the chessboard,and keeping them alive might serve a greater plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis raised a hand and rubbed at his temples, steadying his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes fell on Reginald, whose face was purple and swollen from hanging, and he spoke with chilling casualness. &#34;Let him down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguards moved without delay, stepping forward to loosen the ropes. Reginald dropped heavily to the floor, coughing violently as he gulped for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis stood over him, gaze sharp and disdainful. &#34;Give him some water.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned to Neville, his words low and frigid,each one precise as a blade. &#34;Keep them under strict watch. Ensure they have enough food and water.Don&#39;t let them die. And be wary of Reginald-he knows how to fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his orders delivered, Luis turned on his heel and strode toward the warehouse door.</p>
