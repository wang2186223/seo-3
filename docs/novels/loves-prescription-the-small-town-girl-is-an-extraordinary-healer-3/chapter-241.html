                <p>After the elevator doors slid open, Luis found himself answering a call from his assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half-listening, he wandered through the lobby, the routine work updates barely registering. His mind kept circling back to the woman&#39;s voice he&#39;d heard on Isaac&#39;s call earlier,leaving him oddly distracted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, someone brushed past, bumping his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My apologies!&#34; Two pleasant voices overlapped-Luis &#39; magnetic voice and a gentle woman&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After offering the courteous apology, he moved along and disconnected his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden realization hit him. That voice rang a bell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis paused, turned to look behind him, but only caught a glimpse as the elevator doors closed. The woman&#39;s face slipped out of view before he could be sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition struck. He was sure the voice belonged to the young woman who had given him a ride the day before. Now it seemed clear-the voice from lsaac&#39;s call matched the one he&#39;d just heard in the lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he pieced it together, Luis&#39; eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be? Was she really Isaac&#39;s wife?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought left a trace of unease on his face,lines creasing his brow as he considered the implications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If his plans ever put him at odds with Isaac, she might get caught in the crossfire as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis thought back to the one time he&#39;d met her, and the memory still carried a quiet kind of ease that hadn&#39;t faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He liked her-not with any romantic longing, but in the way one appreciated calm in the middle of noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something about being near her that simply felt safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As that thought settled in, a sharp focus lit up his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he pulled out his phone and placed a call to one of his men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find out who Simon Moss has been talking to lately,&#34;said Luis, his tone firm and deliberate. After relaying his orders, he ended the call and squinted thoughtfully at the closed elevator doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding his sister took priority before he tangled with Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Simon had managed to track her down, Luis felt confident he would not be far behind in the search.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever his motivations, Luis had no interest in making lsaac an enemy. Their exchange today had proven Isaac was not someone to take lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew a steady breath, cast one last look behind,and walked out of Bennett Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside the elevator, Verena heard Isaac&#39;s confused voice come through her phone. &#34;What&#39;s this surprise about?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly smile tugged at her lips as she teased, &#34;I&#39;m keeping it a secret for now. You&#39;ll see soon enough.Bye!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hung up before he could reply, ending the call on a playful note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator doors opened with a soft ding, signaling her arrival at the correct floor. Verena stepped into the bright hallway, her steps echoing as she made her way down the wide corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob spotted her right away and stood to greet her,calling out, &#34;Mrs. Bennett, have you come to visitMr.Bennett? I&#39;ll let him know you&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cut him off with an easy smile. &#34;There&#39;s no need for that, Jacob. I&#39;d rather go in on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded in agreement. &#34;Of course, Mrs. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,Verena smiled back and continued toward the office at the end of the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she reached the door, she gave it a soft, polite knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Isaac was buried in a stack of documents,his mind miles away from everything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he heard the gentle tapping, he didn&#39;t bother to look up and simply called out, &#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then returned to his work without missing a beat.</p>
