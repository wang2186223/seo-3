                <p>After this bombshell hit the internet, users swarmed the comments section,their words dripping with irony and ridicule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those in the industry who knew Katelyn couldn&#39;t resist spilling the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I recall, isn&#39;t she employed at Cloverland Hospital?No wonder she rose so high.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought her success came from extraordinary skill.Turns out, it&#39;s her talent for winning favors that&#39;s extraordinary. She plays her cards well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her family bragged endlessly about how she walked straight into Cloverland Hospital right after graduation,a place others could only dream of. And in just two years,she became head of the department. Back then,I wondered how she managed it. Now the fog has cleared-it was all strings pulled behind the scenes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait a minute! Isn&#39;t the hospital director already married? And his wife isn&#39;t someone to be trifled with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right. I live in Clokron, and the director&#39;s wife commands one of the strongest underground networks here. By clinging to the director,Katelyn has set herself against a stone wall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable. Katelyn really dares to walk on thin ice.Isn&#39;t she afraid of payback?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scrolling through the comments, Katelyn felt her chest tighten, her hands trembling so badly she could scarcely hold her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line &#34;Isn&#39;t she afraid of payback?&#34; echoed like a bell in her ears, sending a chill down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she first entangled herself with the director,she had weighed the risks of discovery. Yet at that time,securing a post at Cloverland Hospital meant more than fear of exposure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had acted with painstaking caution,convinced no one would ever uncover her secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn dared not finish the thought,swallowed whole by a storm of dread and rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, she clenched her teeth and hissed, &#34;Verena...this must be Verena&#39;s doing. She&#39;s the one behind it all...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Buzz...buzz...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone suddenly rang, startling her so much she nearly dropped it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching it tight, she glanced at the screen, bit her lip,and braced herself before answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,what&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had the words left her lips than her mother&#39;s icy voice cut in, sharp as a whip.&#34;How dare you ask me that? Tell me, what is this trending scandal online? And what&#39;s going on with those men in the photos?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dahlia Fuller, decisive and commanding by nature, had a presence that silenced rooms. When she scolded,the weight of her authority crushed like a mountain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn shivered beneath her reprimand, her voice breaking. &#34;Mom,please,let me explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Dahlia was too furious to hear her out; rage made her dizzy. She cut in sternly, &#34;After all the years we raised you to walk the straight path-is this your repayment? Do you know your father has collapsed from the shame you&#39;ve caused?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing a sharp breath, Dahlia pressed on, &#34;From childhood, we gave you everything, never denying you a thing. And this is how you repay us? Deeds so sordid we cannot lift our heads? Do you know no shame at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears blurred Katelyn&#39;s eyes, regret and pain spilling over as she cried, &#34;Mom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t call me Mom!&#34; Dahlia shot back&lt;like lightning.&#34;I have no daughter like you. Once you brought me pride,now you bring me disgrace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn shook her head in desperation, her sobs choking. &#34;Mom, listen, it&#39;s not what it seems...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Dahlia had already verified the photos and videos.They were genuine, and so she hung up coldly,refusing another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The abrupt end of the call left Katelyn hollow,as though the floor had caved beneath her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in truth, her world was crumbling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scandal spread like wildfire, aided by Jacob&#39;s contacts who released it overseas with precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t long before the wife of the director of Cloverland Hospital heard of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Known for her demand for perfection,she wasted no time. She ordered the media to publish Katelyn&#39;s dismissal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amid her panic, Katelyn read the foreign reports with trembling eyes: she had been publicly expelled by the  director&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One calamity piled upon another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with her strong will,she could not withstand blow after blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had returned to the country dreaming of curing Isaac and remaining by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she failed to win him, she could still flee abroad,living in comfort and basking in envy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why she had not resigned her post-only applied for a year&#39;s leave, quickly approved thanks to her ties with the director.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now Isaac despised her, her parents turned their backs, society scorned her, her job abroad was ruined,and she was hunted by the director&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each blow fell like thunder upon her head, leaving her dizzy, staggering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clutched her collar, agony tearing at her. Her chin quivered, lips bitten until blood welled, and at last she broke into sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, she bit down hard, forcing the tears back. This was no time for weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sniffled, steadying her breath, willing her frantic heart to calm, and pushed her mind toward the question of survival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reputation had to be salvaged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her disgrace spreading both at home and abroad,no safe haven remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she told herself, &#34;Restore your name, and everything may yet change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To do so, she needed to uncover the hand behind the trending storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she prepared to call for an investigation,another call came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the caller ID, her brows furrowed deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would he call now, of all times?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dreadful thought seized her, making her heart lurch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered, her voice sharp with accusation.&#34;Isaac,was this your doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t deny it. Calmly, almost coldly, he said,&#34;Yes. It was me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s anger flared. Her voice shook as she demanded, &#34;Why? Why would you ruin me like this? How can you be so heartless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s lips curved into an indifferent smile. &#34;Heartless?I only gave you a taste of your own medicine.You smeared my wife, fanning the flames of slander.As for you,I merely uncovered the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words cut sharper than a knife. Katelyn&#39;s pride crumbled under the weight of his cruelty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac, we grew up together. Do you really have no regard for our past?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Isaac&#39;s reply was colder still. &#34;I warned you not to lay a hand on my wife. You chose to ignore me,leaving me no choice. Continue to meddle, and you&#39;ll see how far my patience stretches. I will not hesitate to strike at the Fuller family itself. What you suffer now is only the beginning. Out of respect for your parents, I&#39;ve spared the Fuller family. But defy me again, and you&#39;ll lose not only reputation, but wealth and standing.You will no longer be the Fuller heiress.&#34;</p>
