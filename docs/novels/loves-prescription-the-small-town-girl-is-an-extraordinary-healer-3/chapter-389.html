                <p>Luis&#39; eyes glittered with a cold, amused irony. To him,Rowland&#39;s declaration of loyalty was nothing more than a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing. His lies, full of seams and weak stitches, looked laughable under that stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis fought down the laugh that wanted to burst free,the corner of his mouth barely twitching as his narrow,deep-set gaze roved over Rowland&#39;s flushed face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One look told him everything: the man&#39;s forced calm,the eagerness for approval. A pawn desperate for a favor-already the most obvious piece to be sacrificed on the board-and he didn&#39;t even know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis set the photo frame back with deliberate cae,turning it face down on the desk. He neatly folded and smoothed the handkerchief beside it with precise,almost ritualistic motions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, lifting his head, he asked softly, &#34;You&#39;ve worked under me for years. I want to hear your thoughts. If we were to deal with Darrell, how do you think we should proceed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rowland blinked, taken aback for a heartbeat, and then pasted on a sycophantic smile so fast it might have been rehearsed. Excitement threaded his voice.&#34;Mr. Sampson, if it were up to me, we&#39;d gather everyone tied to the underground businesses. Make an example of Darrell in front of them. Let those punks see that breaking your rules leads to only one end: death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands sketched phrases in the air as he spoke,nervous flourishes betraying his confidence. &#34;Think about it. If word spreads about Darrell, the underlings will riot. Authority has to be established-in public.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis leaned back into the leather, fingers tapping a slow, measured rhythm on the armrest. A small,almost amused smile curved his lips. &#34;Rowland, that makes sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pride swelled in Rowland&#39;s chest. He fought to wrap the feeling in deferential humility. &#34;All thanks to your guidance, Mr. Sampson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go,&#34; Luis said,waving a hand without looking up. His voice dropped, flat and certain. &#34;I&#39;ll handle Darrell&#39;s mess myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,sir,&#34; Rowland answered, bowed, and left the room with practiced, respectful steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the door shut, Luis let his eyes narrow until they were slits; the warmth drained from them like color from a photograph. Silence settled in the office, broken only by the steady tapping of hs fingertips against wood-a slow,dangerous metronome in the hush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lounge door slid open without a sound. Verena and lsaac glided in, exchanging a brief, loaded look with Luis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac broke the quiet first. &#34;Looks like this drama&#39;s headed for its climax.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; hand closed on the photo frame and flipped it upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the yellowed photograph, a younger Joseph stood in a dark blue suit, Sherwood&#39;s hand thrown over his broad shoulder; the old courtyard wall behind them crawled with ivy, both men smiling into the sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now the glass reflected Luis-cold, hard, implacable.He pressed a fingertip to Sherwood&#39;s faint smirk as if trying to blur the man from existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood in that image was, to Luis, nothing more than a snake that had learned to grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fixed his gaze on that frozen smile, the words low and bitter as gravel. &#34;Those who stir trouble from the shadows will be paid back in the same coin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena settled herself across from him, pearl earrings  swinging softly, catching the lamp&#39;s light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rested her elbows on the desk, thumb and forefinger supporting her temple, and spoke in a controlled,thoughtful cadence. &#34;Sherwood is trying to pin serious crimes on the Sampson family, but he can&#39;t do it alone: Daren-the old fox-is the linchpin Sherwood needs him to manufacture the frame. We need to have the police monitor their calls and record transactions, timing of deliveries. That&#39;s how we expose his setup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening, the hatred in Luis&#39; eyes refashioned itself into something sharper-an icier, more focused light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set the frame down with the same deliberate calm and looked at Verena and Isaac. &#34;You reminded me of something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let his plan show in the corners of his mouth. &#34;I&#39;ll put a few trustworthy officers on Sherwood-24/7surveillance of his communications.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He met their eyes, a cold promise curling into a smile.&#34;This time, let&#39;s make Sherwood taste the sting of his own trap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s someone else we&#39;ve overlooked-someone crucial.&#34; Isaac drummed his fingers against the desk,each dull thud echoing like a ticking clock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena leaned back in her chair, brows knitting as she  studied him. &#34;We&#39;ve already accounted for all of Sherwood&#39;s cards, haven&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis halted his pen mid-spin, his confusion mirroring hers as his eyes settled on lsaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thin sneer curved Isaac&#39;s mouth. &#34;Sherwood&#39;s a wily old fox. He&#39;s willing to throw himself into the fire, but notice how he keeps his daughter under lock and key at home. That&#39;s his weak point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their network of informants had mapped Sherwood&#39;s daily life to the smallest detail-his routines,his guards, even the rhythm of his household.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac folded his arms, gaze dipping with cold certainty.&#34;We could track him forever and still come up short.But if we hold his daughter, he&#39;ll fold. No questions asked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding flickered across Verena&#39;s face like sudden light. Her eyes brightened as she leaned forward. &#34;You&#39;re suggesting we use Molly as leverage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low laugh slipped from her lips. &#34;Sherwood hides her away with guards at every corner. Getting her out of that fortress will take more than brute force-it&#39;ll take finesse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac opened his mouth, but Luis was already sliding his pen aside. He reached for a leather-bound calendar, fingers skimming across its pages until they came to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In three days,&#34; he said, his voice carrying a cold edge,&#34;the Mile Art Museum is holding its Emerging Artists Exhibit. Molly will be there without question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Painting was Molly&#39;s passion, though her canvases betrayed no natural gift. Backed by Sherwood&#39;s inexhaustible wealth, she staged annual shows regardless, each one swarming with social climbers eager to curry favor with her father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half a year ago, she had pressed an invitation into Luis &#39; hand. He&#39;d declined, but his mind catalogued details with the precision of a blade; one glance was all it took for the memory to resurface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After listening to his explanation, Verena nodded slowly. &#34;So that&#39;s our window.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze lingered on Luis&#39; tightened jaw, and then shifted to the fire burning behind Isaac&#39;s eyes. At last she straightened, lips curling with a confident tilt.&#34;Neither of you fits that crowd. Molly&#39;s circle is all about high society ladies. I can pass as a staff member-slip in, slip out, no one the wiser. Let me take the lead on this one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; expression softened, pride flickering through the warmth in his eyes. He reached out, laying a steady  hand on her shoulder. His voice was low, threaded with the quiet authority only an elder brother carried. &#34;No one sees details the way you do. You&#39;re the only one who can pull this off. I can breathe easier with you in charge, but promise me you won&#39;t take reckless chances. Your safety comes first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena covered his hand with hers, giving two light pats of reassurance. &#34;I know. Don&#39;t worry. Trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her,Isaac lifted a hand, brushing a loose strand from her face with reverent care. His touch lingered,thumb grazing her cheek as though she were something too rare to mishandle. &#34;I&#39;ll see the museum&#39;s cameras disabled, and my best men stationed nearby,&#34; he promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice, indulgent yet commanding, pressed close.&#34;Stay sharp. If anything feels wrong, signal me. I&#39;ll bring backup and break the doors down myself if l have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lips curved in amusement at his tension.She tilted her face up, eyes glittering with mischief. &#34;With my husband watching over me, what could I possibly fear?&#34;</p>
