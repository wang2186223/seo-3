                <p>Looking back now, Laura couldn&#39;t recall a single moment when Verena had purposefully concealed her talents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, it was Laura and Alec who refused to recognize their daughter&#39;s strengths, never once asking how she truly felt or what she faced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible that Verena had always possessed such remarkable abilities?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither parent had ever reached out with real care,nor had they taken the time to sit down for an honest conversation. Understanding her had never been their priority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, they simply shaped Verena in the mold of their own assumptions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That realization hit Laura with the force of a revelation, and waves of regret washed over her,leaving an ache in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions churned in her mind. This was the child she&#39;d carried for months, the girl she brought into the world with so much hope. How had she treated Verena like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frozen where they stood, both Alec and Laura found themselves lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec recovered his composure first. Surrounded by an audience of powerful figures, he made sure not to betray a hint of emotion. Smiling with pride, he told them, &#34;Verena has always been bright, never once giving us cause for concern. We&#39;re thrilled by all she&#39;s accomplished. Still, I can&#39;t match my daughter&#39;s abilities. These days, the business world is filled with risks, and managing a company has never been tougher. All of you are leaders in your own fields, and I hope you&#39;ll give us your support moving forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never one to let family drama stand in the way of opportunity, Alec used the moment to strengthen business connections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Verena&#39;s reputation shining so brightly, the other businessmen were smart enough to show some respect for Alec.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever disagreements simmered beneath the surface, blood ties remained untouchable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing with Alec was a move nobody here would regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glasses were raised all around, and the group repeated, &#34;Certainly, Mr. Willis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the rest of the meal, both Alec and Laura seemed distracted, their thoughts elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once dinner ended and Alec finished small talk with a few business acquaintances, they left for home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at Willis Villa, Kaia lounged on the couch,deeply absorbed in a newly released movie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of footsteps at the entryway made her pause the film, slip on her slippers, and hurry to welcome Alec and Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bright smile on her face, Kaia called out, &#34;Dad,Mom, you&#39;re home. Come join me-the movie&#39;s really good!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tugged gently at Laura&#39;s hand, hoping for a little warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Laura pulled away, leaving Kaia&#39;s smile to fade. She stared at her parents&#39; clouded expressions,the silence between them was heavy and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the day she fled home, a wall seemed to stand between her and her parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec&#39;s distant manner made her nervous, and that fear lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused by their sudden cold shoulders, Kaia hesitated and finally asked, &#34;Dad, Mom, did something happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec snapped, his anger barely contained as he flung his phone toward her. &#34;You still have the nerve to ask? Take a look for yourself! Your constant clashes with Verena have held the Willis family back from reaching real success.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, on the drive home from the dinner party, both Alec and Laura had watched the entire livestream unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger smoldered between them, threatening to boil over. The moment they saw Kaia acting as if nothing was wrong, they unleashed all their frustration in her direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Puzzled, Kaia caught the phone and glanced down at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s face stared back at her from the video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught up in a school competition, Kaia only recently managed to relax and watch a movie, all while remaining oblivious to what had been happening online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a result, Maxton&#39;s live broadcast had gone completely unnoticed by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at the screen in confusion, uncertain what to make of it. &#34;What&#39;s this about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s voice cut in, icy and distant. &#34;Just watch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Kaia pressed play, Verena appeared on camera,introducing herself as Evelyn, her tone steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next to her, Maxton openly praised Verena, vouching that she was not romantically involved with Tobin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. I am Evelyn Rowe, and I came to Clokron for one reason-to treat Mr. Maxton Fairclough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words echoed in Kaia&#39;s head, turning her face ashen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion settled over her as she struggled to process what she was seeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands started to shake, and she nearly lost her balance as the reality hit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could this be true?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t Katelyn always claimed to be Evelyn? How was Verena suddenly revealed as Evelyn? Somebody had to be lying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Verena have pulled off such a deception?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia quickly dismissed the idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena might have reason to lie, but the chairman of Smoothdeed Group would not, which made his information unquestionably reliable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deceiving him was something Verena wouldn&#39;t have the courage to attempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that Verena was truly Evelyn?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But where did that leave Katelyn?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia had been told outright by Katelyn that she was Evelyn, and Katelyn had vowed to stand with her in bringing Verena to justice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s lashes fluttered, and panic swept across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization struck; Katelyn had been the one to mislead her all along. That same resentment Katelyn held toward Verena had been used as a weapon, turning Kaia into a pawn in her schemes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes grew wide as everything fell into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was unthinkable. The doctor she&#39;d admired from afar, the very person who had given her a sense of direction and taught her how to fit in, was Verena,her own flesh and blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what did she do to her sister?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What choices had she made since Verena stepped into her life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afraid that their parents&#39; love might shift away,she had done nothing but stand against Verena,spreading rumors, setting traps, and wishing her gone for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of seeing the truth, Kaia believed every word from Katelyn&#39;s mouth, sided with her, and even plotted against Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All this time, Evelyn, the person she idolized and respected above all, had been Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of guilt crashed over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unsteady on her feet, Kaia stumbled backward, tears streaming down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her voice trembling and lost, she pleaded,&#34;Dad,Mom, I never meant to hurt Verena...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec&#39;s cold voice cut her off, &#34;Don&#39;t call me that.I have no daughter like you.&#34; He left wvithout another glance, heading straight upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sobs shook Kaia&#39;s shoulders as she watched him disappear.Desperate, she grabbed Laura&#39;s sleeve.&#34;Mom, please, you have to believe me. If I&#39;d known Verena was Evelyn, I could never have acted this way.She&#39;s been the person I looked up to for so long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s stare remained icy and unmoved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Kaia not targeted Verena from the beginning,maybe things could have been different between Laura and Verena. Still, Kaia constantly pushed her to take sides against Verena, a pressure that eventually shattered their bond as mother and daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought made Laura pull away, giving her a final look full of disappointment. &#34;Kaia, you&#39;ve truly let us down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, please,it&#39;s not what you think...&#34; Kaia&#39;s words broke down into sobs as Laura turned and walked away, refusing to look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her parents walked past without a trace of warmth, Kaia collapsed into tears, her body trembling with each sob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret tangled with bitterness as it consumed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she&#39;d known the truth about Verena, she would have kept her distance from Katelyn, never letting herself be used against her own sister.</p>
