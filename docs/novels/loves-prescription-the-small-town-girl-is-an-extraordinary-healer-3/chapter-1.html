                <p>By the time March rolled around, Shoildon was buzzing with one jaw-dropping news afteranother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word spread first that Isaac Bennett-the eldest son of the city&#39;s wealthiest and most influential family-had been in a devastating car crash, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another shock followed quickly: the prestigious Bennett family had chosen to bind themselves to the newly risen Willis family/ through marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The biggest stir came from the pairing itself-the groom, none other than the now-disabled Isaac, and the bride, the Willis family&#39;s eldest daughter, a young woman raised far from the city&#39;s refinement in an isolated rural backwater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miles away from the glittering skyline, Verena Willis, the name on everyone&#39;s lips, remained in Trisas, the rural place she&#39;d always known.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chime of an incoming message broke the silence of the modest living room where she sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One glance at the screen showed a message from her assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The text read, &#34;Evelyn, I&#39;ve got a patient with an extremely rare case. They&#39;ve been waiting for you for six months.When can you come take a look?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen dimmed as Verena pressed the power button, her delicate fingers lingering over the device.In her clear eyes, sorrow flickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around the world, people knew her as Evelyn Rowe-the miracle-working healer-but fame meant nothing when she couldn&#39;t save the person she loved most. Her grandmother had slipped away the moment she picked up her scalpel, unable to wait any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From behind her came the muffled edge of her parents&#39; voices, their quarrel leaking through the thin walls of the house. &#34;Alec, the company is drowning in unfinished business, and Kaia&#39;s eighteenth birthday party is right around the corner. Tell me, which is more important-a pile of work and a major family celebration, or a dead person? Besides, we need Verena back in the city so she can learn proper manners. If she acts like some country hick girl after joining the Bennett family, it&#39;ll be the Willis name everyone laughs at!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop calling her a country hick girl. She&#39;s your daughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If she weren&#39;t my daughter, do you think I&#39;d bother making the trip to fetch her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stifled a small laugh as their bickering went on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two people arguing in the room were not strangers but her own parents, Alec Willis and Laura Willis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once,they had been ordinary employees, clawing their way up inch by inch until success finally came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in those early years of scraping by, they had no time for a child, so her grandmother, Shawna Willis,had taken her in when she was only a month old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with their hectic schedules, her parents had still managed to think of her now and then, sending word or a token of affectionwhen they could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The change in their priorities began the moment their business took off and they launched their own company. At seven years old, Verena gained a younger sister, Kaia Willis, and from that day forward, her arents&#39; interest in her began to fade. As the Willis fortune grew, they slid seamlessly into the ranks of high ociety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>aura would call from time to time, but her conversations were never about Verena&#39;s schooling or health.stead, she would go on about Kaia, the younger sister she called the family&#39;s lucky charm, as if Laura&#39;s ly mission was to brag about the child who supposedly brought them prosperity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hor narents came back to Trisas for a visit. sunuori, Laura became pregnant again and gave birth to a son. From that point on, all of their attention went to Kaia and the boy. Money arrived regularly, but they themselves stayed away for fifteen years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Shawna hadn&#39;t passed away, Verena was certain her parents would have gone on ignoring them entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after the funeral rites were done did Verena agree to travel to Shoildon with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They spoke warmly, as though eager to have her close, but she understood what was really at play. After all,it was easy enough to learn the news in Shoildon with a quick search online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura broke the silence as they neared the Shoildon residence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, keep in mind-if anyone asks about your education, you tell them you graduated from Acorith College of Medicine with a master&#39;s degree and that you&#39;re about to start your internship...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, Laura had never pictured Verena as anything more than a small-town clinic doctor.Trisas,after all, was nothing but a secluded mountain town in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Verena had never attended college-or so she believed-Laura assumed she&#39;d only picked up a few simple skills from the local medics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The few comments she&#39;d overheard from Shawna about Verena studying medicine had been enough for her o settle on that assumption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>corith&#39;s medicine program was ranked first in the country, and Laura had no qualms about using its name prop up her own image. Heaven forbid anyone discover that her eldest daughter&#39;s practice was in some ural backwater. That, she thought, would be humiliating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>erena sneered at Laura&#39;s vanity, knowing Laura had never cared to truly understand her. In all her life, Laura had never once asked about her education. Once, Verena missed two of the exams due</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to illness, resulting in low scores. When Laura later learned her scores were low, she had concluded her daughter was unfit for higher learning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when Shawna tried to tell them the good news of Verena&#39;s admission to a top-tier university,both parents brushed it aside, mentioning work matters before abruptly ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, Verena and Shawna stopped trying to share anything meaningful with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena looked Laura in the eye and said evenly, &#34;I never studied at Acorith College of Medicine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bluntness made Laura&#39;s lips press together. In her eyes, Verena&#39;s refusal to play along wasn&#39;t strength -it was stubbornness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course she knew Verena had never been a student there; that was the whole point of telling her to lie.Compared to Kaia, who might not match Verena&#39;s beauty but had achievements to show for herself, Verena was nothing but an embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could scold her, Alec&#39;s pointed cough from the front seat forced her to bite back the words.Letting the matter drop, Laura shifted her focus with a softened tone, the indulgence in it clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway, your sister&#39;s used to being spoiled. Try not to provoke her, alright? She gets upset easily and refuses to eat when she&#39;s in a mood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena couldn&#39;t help finding it all a little ridiculous. Almost eighteen and still carrying herself like a pampered child, Kaia was the very picture of being spoiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their exchange ended as the car rolled to a stop in front of a lavish villa that all but flaunted its wealth.Verena stepped out first, taking in the grand facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the entrance, a girl in a cute T-shirt and short skirt came dashing toward them-Kaia, in all her youthful eagerness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, Mom, you&#39;re finally back!&#34; Kaia&#39;s voice rang out, bright and eager. The brightness dimmed when her gaze landed on Verena. Her eyes lingered, scanning Verena from head to toe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clad in aplain cream hoodie and pale yellow pants with clean white sneakers, Verena&#39;s look was ordinary at first glance. Yet her delicate features, flawless skin, and calm, distant aura gave her a beauty that couldn&#39;t be ignored.Nothing about her spoke of years spent in some remote countryside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia knew exactly who she was looking at-her full-blood sister-but the two had never shared a home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life in Shoildon had made Kaia the untouchable little princess of the Willis family, the jewel in their parents&#39;eyes. This sudden reappearance of an elder sister left her with a subtle, uneasy knot in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Kaia, honestly. How can you come outside wearing so little? Aren&#39;t you freezing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s eyes went straight to the thin fabric Kaia wore before she quickly slipped off her own coat and draped it over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a giggle, Kaia leaned against her mother. &#34;Ha-ha, Mom, it&#39;s really not cold at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a scene warm enough to melt the chill from the air-but Verena had never been part of such moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughing together, Kaia and Laura headed inside, leaving Verena standing where she was, as though her arrival had already been forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she walked, Kaia&#39;s eyes found Verena for a brief moment, casting a lingering, unreadable look over her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sight of his younger daughter, Alec&#39;s expression softened, and he turned to bridge the gap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s your sister, Kaia. She&#39;s done very well for herself. Scored high marks on her college entrance exams and already secured her spot at Acorith College of Medicine...&#34;</p>
