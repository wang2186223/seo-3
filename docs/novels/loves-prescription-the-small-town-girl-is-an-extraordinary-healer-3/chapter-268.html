                <p>Verena&#39;s brow furrowed in clear annoyance. A spark of impatience flickered in her eyes as she replied,&#34;Absolutely not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blunt refusal hit Luis hard. He felt his confidence drain away, leaving him slumping in his chair. With a defeated sigh, he pressed a hand to his forehead,at a complete loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t help feeling disappointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yesterday, he&#39;d blurted out the wrong thing and left in a rush, and today he&#39;d only made it worse by suddenly asking for her chat app number. He figured his reputation in Verena&#39;s mind was probably shot,but he promised himself he would find a way to make up for it later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, he had to focus on getting that strand of her hair for the DNA test. After thinking it over, Luis finally settled on a plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave the spoon a calculated flick, sending it tumbling to the floor near Verena&#39;s feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a touch of regret in his expression, he said,&#34;Mrs. Bennett, would you mind picking that up for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena barely hesitated, reaching down out of courtesy to retrieve the spoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she bent over, Luis quietly reached out and snagged a few stray strands of hair from her shoulder, moving so quickly that she didn&#39;t notice a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened up and handed him the spoon,but before she could say anything, Luis shot to his feet.&#34;Sorry,Mrs.Bennett. Something just came up. I need to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, he turned and left the restaurant in a hurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena sat there, the spoon still in her hand, watching Luis&#39; retreating figure with a puzzled frown.His behavior left her feeling irritated and confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t make sense of his odd actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Luis clutched the tiny plastic bag holding Verena&#39;s hair as he hurried to his car and made straight for a hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached the hospital in record time, heading straight for the lab where DNA tests were handled.Without wasting a minute, Luis handed the hair samples to the lab technician. &#34;Please, I need this processed as fast as possible,&#34; he said, urgency sharpening his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, these results took days, but Luis wasn&#39;t just any person. He leaned on his connections,making sure the request jumped to the front of the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff recognized his name and status, and no one dared delay. They got to work right away, prepping the samples for immediate testing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With nothing left to do, Luis paced the hallway, and then dropped onto a bench near the lab, his nerves stretched tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept glancing at the closed door, every second stretching longer than the last. His heart hammered in his chest, and his thoughts ran wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the test said Verena wasn&#39;t his sister, what then?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would everything he&#39;d been searching for disappear in an instant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if she really was his long-lost sibling, how could he possibly make up for missing all those years?How could he face her now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiting felt endless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, the lab door swung open. Luis shot to his feet, unable to keep his anxiety from spilling out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A doctor stepped out, test results in hand. Luis met him halfway, barely keeping his voice steady. &#34;Do you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>have the results?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor scanned the report, and then offered a small, reassuring smile. &#34;Congratulations, Mr.Sampson.The results confirm the blood ties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Luis stood rooted in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears stung his eyes as he whispered, &#34;She&#39;s really my sister. After all this time, I finally found her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wiping his eyes, Luis hurried to his car,fumbled with his phone, and dialed a number, hands still trembling with emotion.</p>
