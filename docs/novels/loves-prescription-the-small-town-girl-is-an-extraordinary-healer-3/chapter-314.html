                <p>The moment the announcement was made, the hall froze as though time itself had stumbled. Shock rippled through the crowd,leaving everyone silent and wide-eyed,unable to digest what they had just heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air grew heavy, disbelief written across every face,as if trust had suddenly become too costly to afford.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly, just stepping out of the restroom, caught Luis &#39;voice as his words fell like a hammer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stride faltered, feet rooted to the floor.She lifted her gaze toward the stage, her expression clouded with incredulity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis was placing the reins of Benedict Pharmaceuticals into Verena&#39;s hands?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes clung to Verena, blazing with a mix of shock and bitterness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly had poured years of sweat into managing Benedict Pharmaceuticals, brick by brick, like building a fortress in stormy weather. And now, Verena appeared out of nowhere, only to have the whole fortress delivered to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Molly herself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she expected to bow before Verena, as though the years of her labor were mere shadows?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought gnawed at her, feeding a deep well of resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew well that Benedict Pharmaceuticals was the Sampson family&#39;s property, but without her father&#39;s devotion, it would have been a withered tree long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Verena even fathom the labyrinth of management? A pharmaceutical company was no corner store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could a young woman, freshly acknowledged by the Sampson family and untested in business, hope to steer such a mighty ship?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dissatisfaction, envy, and anger twisted together in Molly&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glared from below the stage, teeth clenched tight, and then stalked toward the guest seating area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, faint gasps fractured the silence,and the audience slowly regained its voice. Soon the hall stirred like waves in a restless sea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can Verena truly manage such a company right after joining the Sampson family?&#34; someone muttered,brows furrowed with doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed! Benedict Pharmaceuticals is the lifeblood of Sampson Group. Though young, its future is bright,&#34;an elegantly dressed woman agreed,her tone sharp with skepticism. &#34;To entrust it so hastily to a novice -what on earth is Luis thinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bespectacled man stroked his chin,eyes narrowed in thought. &#34;There must be a hidden reason. Surely,he doesn&#39;t genuinely believe she&#39;s capable... does he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could she be incompetent?&#34; A firm voice cut through the murmur like a bell ringing clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads turned toward a stout middle-aged man who had just spoken. &#34;Have you forgotten who Verena truly is? She is Evelyn, famed for her unmatched medical skill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, sweeping the crowd with a knowing smile.&#34;When it comes to medicine, or leading a pharmaceutical venture, who among you holds more weight than she? And beyond that, remember her husband. Isaac commands Shoildon&#39;s business world with an iron grip. His judgment could outwit a hundred men.&#34; The man&#39;s lips curled, as though mocking the narrowness of the crowd.&#34;With these two truths alone,how could you still call her unfit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words struck like sparks, stirring commotion anew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone nodded thoughtfully. &#34;Yes, there&#39;s an old saying in business: &#39;Ochrerayd&#39;s Sampson, Shoildon&#39;s Bennett.&#39; Both families stand as pillars. Under Isaac&#39;s lead, the Bennett family has flourished,his foresight razor-sharp.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A middle-aged woman added, &#34;If the Bennett family has embraced Verena, it must be for more than her skill in healing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another guest sighed, &#34;Perhaps Luis&#39; choice to entrust her with Benedict Pharmaceuticals is a masterstroke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the growing chatter, Molly froze mid-motion,her wine glass suspended just shy of her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; The word escaped her, loud and raw, carrying her astonishment tothe room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scanned the hall, heart thudding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes landed on lsaac, seated quietly in his wheelchair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze never wavered from the stage, fixed solely  on Verena, as if the rest of the world had ceased to matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even strangers could read the tenderness etched in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s mind buzzed. Her breath caught as she looked back at Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never had she imagined that Verena&#39;s husband was none other than Isaac Bennett-the formidable leader of Bennett Group, the man whispered about in boardrooms as both savior and storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never seen his methods firsthand, yet his reputation alone was legend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And legends, she knew, were not to be tested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in a long breath, Molly fought to steady her thoughts, her resentment bending under the weight of reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Antagonism,she realized,would be foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Better an ally than an enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze drifted again to Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guests, now enlightened to lsaac&#39;s identity,approached him with eager smiles, each angling for favor. But Isaac remained cool, nodding politely at best, his eyes unfailingly returning to Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly saw it clearly-his devotion,his fierce protection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she knew, should she openly cross Verena, the price would be more than her position. With Isaac&#39;s fiercely protective heart and his reputation for ruthless precision, Molly might find herself unable to plant even a single firm step in the business world, no matter how strong her father&#39;s backing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that were all, it would be a small mercy.Worse still -her very life might hang in the balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing this bitter truth, Molly forced a smile that tasted of defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her wine glass slowly, taking a measured sip to mask her unease, while her mind whirled,calculating the best way to weave a bridge toward Verena instead of burning one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On stage, Verena and Luis stood side by side,bringing their closing words to a graceful end. Verena inclined her head, her gratitude flowing toward the assembled guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis,steady and composed,lifted his hand in a guiding gesture, escorting Verena as they descended the steps together. The audience&#39;s eyes trailed after them, whispers rising and falling like the rustle of leaves in a restless breeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena stepped off the stage, she caught sight of Isaac steering his wheelchair toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his broad hand, he carried a glass of water, his long fingers finely cut, glimmering faintly beneath the lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped before her, tilting his head in quiet affection, and extended the glass. His voice,low and steady, reached her gently. &#34;Here.Have some water.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s smile deepened,lighting her face like dawn.&#34;Thank you,honey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She accepted the glass with both hands, feeling its warmth seep into her palms, anchoring her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her gaze,she sipped lightly, the water easing the dryness in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis, watching the exchange, let his eyes rest on Isaac and arched a brow ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that small gesture, it was clear he had seen enough -his brother-in-law was not only capable, but devoted to Verena with genuine care.</p>
