                <p>Katelyn&#39;s calm certainty left Kaia little room to doubt.A woman as cunning as her would never risk a lie that could be shattered so easily-if she wasn&#39;t truly Evelyn, the real one would step forward to expose the fraud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure Kaia had idolized for years now stood before her, and the awe inside her chest swelled until it drowned everything else. She couldn&#39;t say if anyone alive could defeat Verena, but if Evelyn was involved,Kaia believed it was possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze softened into adoration as she clutched Katelyn&#39;s hand, her voice trembling with devotion.&#34;You&#39;re really Evelyn? I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m meeting you -after all these years, and we&#39;ve even crossed paths before without me knowing. This is incredible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In this country, just call me Katelyn,&#34; Katelyn replied,her smile perfectly composed, though her eyes betrayed nothing. &#34;We&#39;ll have plenty of time together, so there&#39;s no need for such excitement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Kaia&#39;s joy overflowed. She nodded over and over, grinning wide. &#34;Of course, of course. I get it -you don&#39;t want to attract attention. But tell me,when do we strike back at Verena?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s voice flowed like silk, smooth and unhurried. &#34;Not yet. First, you need to regain your strength. When the time is right and the plan is ready, I&#39;ll let you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still sniffling from the cold she&#39;d caught in the storm,Kaia lowered her head and whispered, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of the reason behind Katelyn targeting Verena still gnawed at Kaia, and confusion spilled into her words.&#34;Katelyn, I don&#39;t get it. Isaac isn&#39;t who he used to be. Even with his money and power,he&#39;s a broken man now. Why would someone as extraordinary as you still want him? Honestly, he doesn&#39;t deserve you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her protest was fueled partly by admiration for her idol and partly by the resentment she carried for Isaac&#39;s constant defense of Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added, her tone sharper, &#34;And his legs-they&#39;re ruined. Everyone knows he&#39;ll never walk properly again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn rose to her feet, her confidence radiating.&#34;With me by his side, do you really believe Isaac can&#39;t recover?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze slid past Kaia and out the window,her voice low and resolute, as if she were speaking more to fate than to anyone in the room. &#34;Isaac will be mine.And Verena-she won&#39;t escape me. I&#39;ll drag her down with my own hands. This isn&#39;t only about helping you.I despise her for taking what&#39;s mine, for wearing the title of his wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold smile curved Katelyn&#39;s lips. &#34;One day,Verena will understand that the role of Isaac&#39;s wife belongs to me-and me alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After lingering long enough to let her words settle,Katelyn urged Kaia to rest, and then swept out of the  room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler, waiting just outside, leaned in close and murmured, &#34;Miss Fuller, the guest has arrived. He&#39;s waiting in the study.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without breaking stride, Katelyn gave a single nod,her eyes fixed forward. &#34;Keep watch on the woman inside.I want every move reported back to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler bowed his head respectfully. &#34;Yes, Miss Fuller.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn walked steadily down the hall until she reached the study door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing it open, she stepped inside and greeted the man on the sofa. &#34;Mr. Baldwin, forgive the delay.I hope you haven&#39;t been waiting long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Foley Baldwin, the most powerful voice in Shoildon&#39;s news world, immediately rose to his feet. &#34;Not at all.I only just got here myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, sit,&#34; Katelyn said before lowering herself onto the sofa opposite him. They faced each other across the polished table, and Katelyn laced her fingers together on her lap. Her voice was smooth, deliberate. &#34;Mr. Baldwin, I&#39;m sure my butler has already filled you in on the basics.People like us don&#39;t waste time dancing around. The fact that you&#39;re here tells me you&#39;re ready to do business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other day, following Katelyn&#39;s instructions, her butler had lured Foley out, drowned him in liquor, and set two heavy lockboxes before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By morning, when he woke, the sight had been enough to stun him-neat stacks of cash piled high,far beyond what a man in his position could ever earn in years of honest work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler had whispered at the dinner meeting that this was only the down payment, with far more to come once the job was finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The temptation was too much to resist. And after all,Katelyn&#39;s request wasn&#39;t outlandish-half the news in entertainment was embellished anyway. Not long after, Foley had picked up his phone and asked the butler for the meeting time, greed outweighing hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, recalling the gleam of those banknotes, he grinned broadly. &#34;Miss Fuller, your generosity speaks louder than words. How could I possibly disappoint you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Foley leaned forward eagerly. &#34;Just say the word,Miss Fuller. Whatever you require, I&#39;ll see to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s smile was cool and calculated. &#34;My request is simple. Push the stories of my successes abroad.Dress them up with a little mystery-use phrases like &#39;an enigmatic figure&#39; or &#39;a hidden talent.&#39; Don&#39;t reveal too much. The goal is to nudge the narrative toward Evelyn without ever confirming it. Keep the language vague, leave the speculation hanging. The rest is your craft, not mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After laying out her instructions, she checked the time on her watch, her expression softening into a polite smile. &#34;You&#39;ll have to excuse me now-my trainer is due any minute.&#34; Taking the hint, Foley rose to his feet, bowing his head slightly. &#34;Ah, yes, I just remembered I have pressing matters waiting at the office. Consider it done, Miss Fuller. You&#39;ll have no complaints from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed slightly, a flicker of mock confusion sharpening her gaze, the unspoken warning clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching it instantly, Foley straightened with a nervous chuckle. &#34;Of course. For the record, I&#39;ve spent the entire day at home, handling business privately. No visitors, no conversations. You can count on my discretion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Katelyn&#39;s smile return, her voice smooth. &#34;Good. Safe travels, Mr.Baldwin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Money greased every wheel, and Katelyn&#39;s money in particular worked like oil on fire. Foley wasted no time. By the very next morning, headlines blazed across Shoildon&#39;s media outlets, Katelyn&#39;s name stamped everywhere and whispered in elite circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The banner story read: &#34;Katelyn Fuller Returns with Stellar Credentials! Enigmatic Background Stirs Curiosity among High Society.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the article went live, Foley wasted no time. As Katelyn instructed, he unleashed a wave of paid influencers to flood the comment sections and steer the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first voice popped up. &#34;Wait a second-wasn&#39;t Katelyn living in Clokron all this time? She&#39;s really back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another quickly followed, commenting, &#34;Didn&#39;t she study medicine? I&#39;ve heard rumors she comes and goes like a ghost-totally mysterious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A third comment read, &#34;Oneof my friends swears she went to the same school as Katelyn. They say she might have a second identity... though nobody knows for sure.&#34; Then came a fourth comment. &#34;Word is, she once cured a patient that even top professors couldn&#39;t save. The guy walked away completely healed under her care!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chatter spread, and soon the city&#39;s wealthy began adding their own speculation to the mix.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Shoildon&#39;s upper circles, the gossip spread like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We all knew she came from a family of doctors and was a top student,&#34; one socialite remarked. &#34;But if she&#39;s handling cases beyond even professors,maybe she&#39;s returned for a particular patient?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another leaned in, curiosity piqued, &#34;That could be it.But who would have the power to bring her back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone gestured toward the earlier thread and muttered, &#34;And what about that rumor of a hidden identity? Could it actually be true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An internationally recognized doctor, famous for solving impossible cases... doesn&#39;t that sound exactly like the elusive surgeon, Evelyn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way-that&#39;s what the article was hinting at too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, rumors don&#39;t just appear out of nowhere.Even entertainment reporters wouldn&#39;t dare print that without a shred of truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speculation grew wilder, some debating the real reason behind Katelyn&#39;s return and whispering about her supposed secret identity, while others dredged up stories from her school days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember how obsessed she was with lsaac back in high school?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course! That&#39;s when I realized chasing a man isn&#39;t as easy as everyone claims.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was so relentless, every woman in school avoided even looking at Isaac, terrified Katelyn would &#39;welcome&#39; them with a not-so-friendly warning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Katelyn sat with her phone in hand,scrolling through the comments. A slow, satisfied smile curved her lips. The narrative had taken root exactly the way she wanted-public opinion was shifting, and the stage was set for her next move.</p>
