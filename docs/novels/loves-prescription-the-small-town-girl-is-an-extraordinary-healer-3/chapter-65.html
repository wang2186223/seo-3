                <p>Andres smiled at Verena. &#34;Please allow me to go in and announce your arrival, Miss Willis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave a slight nod. &#34;I appreciate your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andres turned, entered the house, and went upstairs,halting before lsaac&#39;s door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knocked twice-silence answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knocked again, yet the room remained still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he raised his hand to try once more, a voice,cold as steel in winter, cut through the silence. &#34;Who is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were few, but the chill in them pierced like ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andres instantly sensed Isaac&#39;s fou mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With due respect, Andres answered, &#34;Mr. Bennett,Miss Verena Willis is here to see you. She&#39;s at the gates. Shall I invite her in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was at the gates?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s head, which had been bowed low, suddenly lifted, his gaze locking on the closed door before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had spent the whole day in that room, doing nothing but staring at his crippled state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Verena&#39;s name was mentioned, his heart thundered, and then clenched painfully as if gripped by an unseen fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, he understood his feelings with painful clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He liked Verena-and he knew she felt something for him,too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet he also knew that no emotion ever sprang up without roots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He admired her character, treasured the way shetreated him differently from how others did to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He liked her gentle, intelligent manner, the kind that drew admiration wherever she went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what about him? What reason could she possibly have to love him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a man bound to the wheelchair,shackled by personal challenges. What could she see in him besides his name and background?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t that lsaac lacked self-respect; it was that her sudden affection felt too abrupt, too fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If his legs could ever be healed, he would not mind her initial intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that hope was a distant star-barely within sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What right did he have to expect Verena to stay with him for a lifetime?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight on his chest felt like a millstone,suffocating him with every breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his head again, eyes shimmering faintly,  his throat swollen with unshed words, each one painful to release. &#34;Tell her I&#39;m already asleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andres caught the strange note in lsaac&#39;s voice.Though he longed to persuade him, experience told him not to meddle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he simply nodded. &#34;Got it, Mr. Bennett. I&#39;ll inform Miss Willis right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Andres&#39; footsteps retreated, Isaac closed his eyes, battling the storm of bitterness within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands, resting on his useless legs, slowly curled into fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They trembled under the strain, veins rising against the skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long struggle, he resisted the burning urge to call Andres back and let Verena in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Andres could head downstairs with the message, Bobby appeared and blocked his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andres turned, puzzled. &#34;Mr. Bennett, what can I do for you?&#34; Moments earlier, Bobby had been on the phone with Slater. Heading for water, he had spotted Andres outside his brother&#39;s door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had approached, overheard their exchange, and quickly muttered to Slater, &#34;Something urgent has come up-we&#39;ll talk later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had cut the line without waiting for an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stopping Andres, Bobby threw a glance at lsaac&#39;s firmly closed door before asking quietly, &#34;Is Verena outside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although uncertain why Bobby brought her up,Andres nodded honestly. &#34;Yes, she is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby broke into a sly grin. So Isaac had finally seen Verena&#39;s true colors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My brother&#39;s clearly awake, yet he tells you to say he&#39;s asleep. Do you know what that means? It means he&#39;s tired of her and doesn&#39;t wish to see her. Unless absolutely necessary, he won&#39;t even give her the time of day. That&#39;s why he made up an excuse to avoid her.&#34; Wearing mock regret, Bobby leaned closer and whispered, &#34;Just go to the gates and tell V/erena straight out that my brother doesn&#39;t want to see her,and she should leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andres frowned. Something about Bobby&#39;s reasoning felt wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated. &#34;Mr. Bennett, isn&#39;t that a little improper?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s improper about it?&#34; Bobby clicked his tongue. &#34;Andres, you&#39;re old enough to know when to adapt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Andres still uneasy, Bobby thumped his chest confidently. &#34;Just do as I say. If anything comes of it,I&#39;ll take responsibility.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andres finally yielded. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll follow your instructions, Mr. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Andres walked downstairs, Bobby whistled lightly and strolled back into his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Andres bowed slightly and, as Bobby had ordered, told Verena, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Miss Willis. Mr.Bennett said he doesn&#39;t want to see you. Please leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes narrowed. She didn&#39;t believe Isaac had uttered those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then again... perhaps he had. Isaac was not one to speak harshly, but in a moment of despair, he might say those words to turn her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered the hoarseness in his voice that day on the phone, and a sharp sting pricked her nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blinking, she steadied herself and looked at Andres.&#34;Forgive me, but I must intrude.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped past him and dashed into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she passed, Andres heard her murmur, &#34;I want to hear lsaac say it himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still stunned, Andres watched her pause midway and ask, &#34;By the way, which room is Isaac&#39;s?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faced with her resolve, he recalled Isaac&#39;s strained tone and pointed upstairs. &#34;The room at the far left on the second floor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena smiled gratefully. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried upstairs and found the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knocking firmly, she called, &#34;Isaac, open the door!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Isaac&#39;s spine went rigid, but he made no move, thinking his ears deceived him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Verena, Isaac. Open the door.&#34; Her voice was muffled by the heavy wood, but it carried through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, Isaac lifted his head, eyes fixed on the sliver of light beneath the door, as if confirming reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His room was dark, and the faint glow outside cast a small shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena was truly there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was at his door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac dropped his gaze again and said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, realizing his deliberate stillness, spoke firmly. &#34;lsaac, have you forgotten everything we talked about? Just because you face difficulties, you retreat? You think by shutting me out, I&#39;ll simply give up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes stayed locked on the faint shadow beneath the door. He longed to tell her to leave,yet his throat closed with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before her, he could not summon a single harsh word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stood before the sealed door, her gaze steady, her tone unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen to me, Isaac. I&#39;ve already committed myself to you. If you won&#39;t open this door, then I&#39;ll wait right here.I can outlast you, no matter how long it takes.&#34;</p>
