                <p>Henson was still new to the corporate world, hardly more than a beginner among sharks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stories about powerful tycoons had always floated around him-lsaac&#39;s name seemed to echo everywhere,a living legend in the business world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d heard plenty about Isaac&#39;s achievements, but he had never crossed paths with the man himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, even though the real lsaac stood inches away,Henson didn&#39;t recognize him as the force everyone whispered about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once his nerves settled, he started believing that these strangers just didn&#39;t understand what true influence looked like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With misplaced confidence, Henson&#39;s boldness returned, his fear vanishing as he tried to put on a show of authority borrowed from his boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twisting and squirming,Henson&#39;s face turned scarlet as he shouted, &#34;Since you&#39;ve realized I work for Sherwood Kirk, you&#39;d better let me go now! Around here, Mr.Kirk&#39;s word is law. The whole business district  answers to him! Ever heard of Sampson Group?Joseph and Luis might have clout, but even they have to show respect when they stand in front of Mr. Kirk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He worked himself into a frenzy, voice cracking and flecks of spit spraying with every boast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac said nothing, simply narrowing his eyes and fixing Henson with an icy stare from above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One mercenary shot a look at Isaac and spoke. &#34;Want me to shut him up for good,Mr.Bennett?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had the threat been made than the other mercenary slipped a dagger from his boot, pressing the sharp tip right beneath Henson&#39;s chin,his movements calm and silent as he waited for the signal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the cold steel kissing his skin, Henson&#39;s confidence vanished. Fear seized him, leaving him frozen and breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face was distorted, his eyes so wide it looked as if they might burst from their sockets. Stammering,he tried to muster another threat. &#34;Y-you-if you lay a hand on me, Mr. Kirk will destroy you all. He&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re left with nothing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clung to Sherwood&#39;s name like a lifeline, hoping it would be enough to scare his captors. But his bluff shattered instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knife at his throat pressed even closer, the steel biting into his skin, cold enough to steal the breath from his lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each shallow breath fogged the blade, and his mouth went dry, the words catching painfully in his throat until he couldn&#39;t force another sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac remained unmoved, his expression carved from stone. &#34;You think tossing Sherwood&#39;s name around will save you? l, Isaac Bennett, am not the sort who bows to anyone-not even your Mr. Kirk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed, a dangerous glimmer flickering in their depths. &#34;It&#39;s a waste of breath to threaten me.Out here, no name carries enough weight to shake me.If you want to keep breathing, forget about Sherwood and start following orders. Even if he showed up in person, he couldn&#39;t pull you out of this mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pulled his foot back, giving the floor a lazy tap that sent Henson&#39;s head snapping sideways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knife beneath his chin moved with him,leaving behind a sharp, red line on his cheek that beaded into a thin trail of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, Henson hardly registered the sting. His shock rooted him in place as he looked up at Isaac. His eyes traveled up from the gleaming shoes, taking in the imposing length of Isaac&#39;s frame, the set of his powerful shoulders, and finally landed on that unyielding, stone-cold stare that sent a chill racing down his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henson&#39;s throat bobbed as he swallowed hard,lips quivering as he muttered,&#34;You-you&#39;re Isaac Bennett?From Shoildon&#39;s Bennett Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words came out broken, terror and disbelief twisting his voice. He had never imagined he&#39;d cross someone so powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold dread washed over him, leaving him breathless and on the verge of collapse. Desperation overtook his pride as he crawled toward Isaac&#39;s feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never done anything to you, Mr. Bennett! If anyone&#39;s caused trouble, it&#39;s Sherwood Kirk-not me,&#34;Henson begged, his voice hitching as he pleaded for mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac remained silent, watching with cold detachment.Seeing no response, Henson rushed to add, &#34;Ask me anything-anything about Sherwood. I&#39;ll spill it all.I know every dirty trick he&#39;s ever pulled, all his secrets!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears and snot streaked down his face as he continued to grovel. &#34;Just let me go. I&#39;ll do whatever you say,I swear! If I lie,may I have a miserable fate!&#34; Isaac finally looked down, his eyes filled with nothing but contempt as he regarded the pitiful sight at his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t picked Henson at random. Luis&#39; list made it clear-Sherwood trusted Henson, keeping him close as a trusted right hand. But clearly, the man crumbled under pressure. On top of that, Henson and Howe had a long-standing feud that made him all the more useful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glimmer of cold amusement flickered across Isaac&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With arms folded, he stared down at Henson, his voice sharp as ice. &#34;You&#39;re going to tell Sherwood you saw Verena and Howe have a private meeting. Say you couldn&#39;t catch their conversation, but you know exactly where and when they met. Make sure you repeat every detail I give you-word for word. Don&#39;t slip up, not once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Howe?&#34; Henson echoed, his surprise quickly giving way to something darker. The realization dawned-Isaac was setting up Howe,and Henson found himself relishing the idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, he hesitated, and then old resentments came flooding back. He remembered all the times Howe looked down on him, always pushing him into the shadows. Now, for once, the upper hand  was his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding his teeth, Henson nodded hard. &#34;Understood,Mr. Bennett. I&#39;ll handle it-just the way you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crooked smile broke across Henson&#39;s face. He&#39;d never cared for Howe, never understood why Sherwood put him on a pedestal. Now, with Isaac&#39;s plan in motion, Henson saw his chance to bury Howe for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac spotted the hint of satisfaction in Henson&#39;s expression, recognizing just how perfectly the pieces were falling into place. Men driven by envy and ambition were the simplest to manipulate-and the most disposable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He folded his arms, lifted his chin, and delivered a warning that cut straight to the bone. &#34;Just do exactly what I told you. Don&#39;t even think about pulling any stunts. If you mess this up, you won&#39;t get another warning from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chill in lsaac&#39;s voice sent a tremor through Henson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate to please, Henson bobbed his head,forcing a shaky smile. &#34;Of course, Mr. Bennett. I won&#39;t slip up,I promise. Everything will be exactly as you ordered.&#34;</p>
