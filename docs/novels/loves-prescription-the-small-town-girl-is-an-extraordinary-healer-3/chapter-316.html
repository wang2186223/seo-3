                <p>At Sampson Villa, after receiving the news, Joseph and Marisa stood waiting at the villa entrance, their eagerness written across their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph,ever thoughtful, supported his wife&#39;s arm,his eyes shifting between the gate and her pale features,gently adjusting her coat now and then to shield her from the evening chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marisa&#39;s gaze never left the entrance. Her expression,worn thin by years of illness, seemed a little vacant,yet her eyes sparkled with a fierce light-an odd marriage of surprise and longing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers tightened together as she murmured over and over, &#34;My little girl... I&#39;m waiting for my little girl to come home...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About five minutes later, three cars appeared in the distance, their headlights glimmering as they rolled steadily toward the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vehicles halted in unison, and one after anoter,the passengers stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis was the first to emerge from the lead car, calling  out a greeting to his parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph returned his son&#39;s gesture with a small nod of acknowledgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the middle car, Verena and Isaac came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Marisa spotted her daughter, her whole face lit up with a smile that seemed to peel away years of sorrow. She slipped from Joseph&#39;s hold,her steps shaky but determined, and cried out,&#34;Sweetheart! My darling daughter is home!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her joy was unguarded, almost childlike in its purity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac offered Joseph a polite nod and said warmly,&#34;Good evening,Joseph.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s smile carried both welcome and relief. &#34;Here you came,lsaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that brief exchange, his eyes were drawn back to his wife and daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight before him stirred a storm of emotions-joy interwoven with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew too well that through the years of Verena&#39;s absence,countless nights had found Marisa clutching the pillow their daughter once used, grieving silently despite her fragile state of mind. And Joseph himself had spent many hours imagining the face of the grown woman their child would become,hoping against hope that she might one day return to their door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had waited for this reunion for more than two decades, holding their breath against disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now,the long-desired moment had finally arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought brought tears stinging to Joseph&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Marisa rushed forward, Verena quickly embraced her. Feeling the cold in her mother&#39;s arms, Verena&#39;s heart throbbed with ache. &#34;Dad, Mom,it&#39;s so windy and chilly. Why are you both standing at the gate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph brushed away the tears at the corners of his eyes,his look torn between resignation and affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, he explained softly, &#34;The moment I told your mother you were coming, she couldn&#39;t keep still.She refused to wait inside-she had to be at the gate to welcome you herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Marisa gripped Verena&#39;s hand tightly,her words stubborn and tender all at once. &#34;Sweetheart,I missed you. I missed you so much...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena knew her mother&#39;s mind had unraveled after her disappearance. For years, Marisa had been ground down by the double burden of illness and longing, enduring a torment no one else could measure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle touch, Verena tucked a few windblown strands behind her mother&#39;s ear. &#34;Mom, I&#39;m here now.I will never leave you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was soft, her gesture even softer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Marisa, caught between hope and disbelief, tilted her head and searched Verena&#39;s face with wary eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching his wife&#39;s reaction, Joseph&#39;s heart clenched with sorrow and resignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through all the years, Marisa&#39;s condition had wavered,but her yearning never weakened-it had only grown roots, deeper and deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis stepped closer, resting a comforting hand on his mother&#39;s shoulder. &#34;Mom, isn&#39;t my sister right here?From now on, we&#39;ll see her often.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Marisa&#39;s doubts eased, and she nodded slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the heaviness lingering in the air, Luis lifted his hand, motioning toward Sherwood and Molly, who had stood quietly at the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, Mom,&#34; Luis said a little louder, &#34;Mr. Kirk has come especially to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marisa barely reacted, still clutching Verena&#39;s hand as if it were her lifeline, her gaze drifting inward to a world of her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph,however,turned from Verena to Sherwood,his expression breaking into one of gratitude and delight. He strode forward quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Sherwood, how wonderful to see you again!&#34;Joseph clasped his old friend&#39;s hand firmly, his eyes brimming with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s smile was warm. &#34;With everyone gathered for such a joyful day, I couldn&#39;t bear to stay away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his side, Molly offered a courteous greeting. &#34;Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Sampson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice rang clear, a touch of shyness beneath its melody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening, Molly.&#34; Joseph beamed, nodding repeatedly in heartfelt approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, glancing at Sherwood, he remarked with fondness,&#34;Sherwood,your daughter grows lovelier by the day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly blushed and lowered her head, whispering,&#34;Thank you,Mr.Sampson.&#34;Sherwood chuckled gently and patted her shoulder.&#34;She&#39;s just a little shy. Spending more time with Luis and Verena will do her good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with a wave of admiration, he continued,&#34;Tonight at the party, both Luis and Verena shone brightly. But Verena especially-her eloquence was striking. In front of so many people, she showed not the slightest fear. Her grasp of business theory was sharp and clear, and she handled the media with effortless poise. Even a man like me,who has seen a fair share of the world, could not help but admire her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s chest swelled with pride at Sherwood&#39;s praise,his smile widening with satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Verena, his eyes shone with paternal affection. &#34;I always knew my daughter would not disappoint.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Marisa didn&#39;t fully understand the details,the joy on everyone&#39;s faces was enough for her. She broke into a wide smile and murmured again and again,&#34;My daughter is incredible. My daughter is incredible ...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s features softened into a gentle smile at her mother&#39;s words. She inclined her head politely toward Sherwood. &#34;Thank you for your kind words, Mr.Kirk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced around at the group, her hair swaying  lightly in the breeze, and added with concern,&#34;The wind is biting. Let&#39;s head inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she wrapped her arm around Marisa, guiding her carefully toward the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis stepped aside quickly to usher Sherwood in.&#34;Please come in,Mr.Kirk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood,smiling,walked with Joseph into the house,followed by Isaac, Luis, and Molly.</p>
