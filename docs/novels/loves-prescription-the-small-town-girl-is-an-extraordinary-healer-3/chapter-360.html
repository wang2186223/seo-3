                <p>Howe hobbled out of the restaurant, struggling to keep his composure as he slid into the back seat of his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slumping against the leather, he fought to catch his breath,his pulse still drumming wildly from everything that had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking back on the showdown with lsaac in that private room left his nerves raw and his mind unsettled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood that walking away wasn&#39;t the end of it.Turning Isaac down was only going to make things messier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s suspicions had already been circling, and now Howe felt like he was trapped in plain sight,just waiting for disaster to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But staying silent would only look like an admission of guilt,and he knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at his phone, Howe&#39;s fingers trembled as he hesitated before finally pressing Sherwood&#39;s contact. Sherwood&#39;s voice came through the line a moment later,low and unreadable. &#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing his throat, Howe forced himself to speak up.&#34;Mr. Kirk, it&#39;s me. Howe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a beat of silence, and then Sherwood replied, his tone flat, &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic rising, Howe rushed to explain himself. &#34;Mr. Kirk,that video and transaction record you&#39;ve seen-they&#39;re fake. Isaac set the whole thing up to make you doubt me. You have to know l&#39;ve always stood by you,no matter what. Please, you&#39;ve got to believe me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy pause lingered on the other end before Sherwood finally answered, voice unshaken, &#34;I&#39;ve heard what you have to say. I&#39;ll decide for myself what&#39;s real and what&#39;s not. Just focus on the work l gave you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call ended, Howe let out a shaky breath,but relief never came. His nerves felt as tight as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he could do now was hope his loyalty would count for something in Sherwood&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across town, Sherwood set his phone down on the desk, a deep furrow in his brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left his seat and crossed the room to the wide  window, hands clasped tightly behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring down at the traffic below, his eyes grew cold and distant, like a storm gathering on the horizon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe&#39;s desperate words rang hollow in his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Real or not, the video and transaction record changed everything. Howe was too involved, too knowledgeable-and with Isaac fixing his eyes on him,things had reached a breaking point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold sneer twisted Sherwood&#39;s lips as he muttered to himself, &#34;So this is how it is. If you&#39;ve forced my hand, don&#39;t expect any mercy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He strode over to his desk, picked up the phone, and dialed a number with a sinister glint in his eye. A cold,twisted smile touched his lips as he said, &#34;Tell the men I&#39;ve trained for years it&#39;s time for a real job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low murmur came from the other end. Sherwood listened,his grin only sharpening, the threat in his eyes becoming unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened, voice as sharp as broken glass. &#34;No loose ends. I want him gone. That&#39;s the price for betraying me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob caught wind of Sherwood&#39;s orders and wasted no time, rushing back to the restaurant where Isaac waited. Jacob entered in a hurry and delivered his report. &#34;Mr.Bennett, Sherwood&#39;s already set things in motion.He&#39;s got his most trusted enforcers ready to make a move on Howe. These men aren&#39;t amateurs-they&#39;re hitmen,and Howe doesn&#39;t stand a chance if we don&#39;t act fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting for further instruction, Jacob fixed his gaze on Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single brow lifted as Isaac let a cold smirk slip onto his face. His voice was low and resolute. &#34;Good work.We stick to the plan. Reach out to Howe right away.Tell him we have proof Sherwood is sending men for him. He needs to disappear now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob gave a crisp nod. &#34;Understood. I&#39;ll see to it immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spun on his heel and hurried from the private room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at home, Howe sat talking with his wife when Jacob&#39;s warning came through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the news registered-assassins were coming for him on Sherwood&#39;s orders-Howe froze in shock, disbelief etched deep in his face. &#34;Are you serious?&#34; he asked,voice strained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob wasn&#39;t surprised. He stayed calm and moved fast. &#34;Check your inbox. I just sent the evidence. Look it over and call me when you&#39;re ready to talk.&#34; As soon as the call ended, Howe opened the file and stared, thunderstruck by what he saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabby Adams, his wife, walked in from the kitchen carrying two mugs of coffee. Noticing the horror on Howe&#39;s face, she set the mugs down and leaned in,her gaze falling on the strange tattoos in the photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey, what&#39;s with those tattoos on their necks?&#34; she asked,worry lacing her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words failed Howe. He just sat there, throat tight,unable to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Howe found his voice. &#34;These men-Sherwood&#39;s private killers. He trained them for years,planning to take down the Sampson family. Now he&#39;s decided I&#39;m the first to test their abilities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold shudder ran through him, settling deep in his bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was unthinkable that after all his loyalty, Sherwood would turn around and mark him for death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand slackened around the phone, and he slumped back against the sofa, weighed down by the impossible choice he now faced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood was ready to see him gone. Isaac, on the other hand, was offering a lifeline-but only if Howe was willing to cooperate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long inner battle, Howe finally called Jacob back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made his decision. For now, he would go with Isaac&#39;s plan and disappear before Sherwood&#39;s men could find him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,with Isaac&#39;s help, Howe and Gabby slipped away into hiding at a safe house no one else knew about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days passed, and when Sherwood realized Howe had vanished, his temper exploded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed the nearest cup and sent it flying across the office. The crash echoed off the walls,coffee splattering everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Useless! Every last one of you!&#34; he shouted,the veins on his forehead throbbing with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Sherwood, Howe&#39;s escape screamed guilt. In his mind, only someone with something to hide would run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stormed around his office, curses tumbling from his lips, the fury in him building by the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find him. I don&#39;t care what it takes-track him down!&#34;Sherwood&#39;s voice boomed,cold and absolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes burned with a wild intensity, promising  retribution if Howe was ever brought back alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood the risk. Howe knew every secret,every hidden detail. If the wrong people got to him first, Sherwood&#39;s empire could come crashing down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Isaac took the news of Sherwood&#39;s meltdown in stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back in his chair, he crossed his arms, the hint of a smile on his face as Jacob waited for instructions.&#34;Now&#39;s our window,&#34; said lsaac, his gaze sharp.&#34;Sherwood&#39;s scrambling. We need to act.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob nodded. &#34;Just say the word, Mr. Bennett.What&#39;s next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s lips curled into a calculating smile. &#34;Spread the news. Let everyone know Howe&#39;s got evidence that Sherwood was behind the Sampson family&#39;s troubles all those years back, and he&#39;s ready to take it to the police.&#34;</p>
