                <p>Inside the car, Isaac pulled a small recorder from his pocket, the device still warm from running nonstop through Howe&#39;s confession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He studied Verena with a look of grim resolve.&#34;This recording is our ticket to finally taking Sherwood down.But audio alone won&#39;t hold up in court. We&#39;ll need to work with Luis, dig up the evidence Howe talked about. Luis has the connections to make that happen -he knows Sherwood&#39;s every weakness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave a determined nod. &#34;Let&#39;s not waste any time.We need to see him right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without delay, they made their way to Luis&#39; office.Luis looked up in surprise as they entered but quickly flashed a welcoming smile, motioning for them to sit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t bother with small talk. He set the recorder on the desk and pressed play, letting Howe&#39;s confession fill the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis listened, his expression growing darker wvith every passing second. Deep lines furrowed his brow as Howe&#39;s voice spun its tale of betrayal and greed. By the time the audio finished, Luis&#39; anger could no longer be contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot to his feet, hands slamming down on the desk with a thunderous crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Papers jumped, a mug nearly toppled, and a pen clattered to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherwood Kirk is a monster!&#34; Luis screamed,his voice raw with rage. His face reddened, veins bulging at his temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes burned with hatred, as if Sherwood were standing within arm&#39;s reach, and he was ready to rip him to shreds. &#34;I actually used to see him as someone worth admiring. But he threw all that away for money and went as far as using a newborn to get what he wanted. Verena has spent all these years drowning in misery because of what he did, robbed of the life she should&#39;ve had. And my parents, they were dragged through all that heartache for absolutely nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; next words came out hard and slow, anger sharpening each syllable. &#34;All this time, I thought we were indebted to him and repaid his family with money and projects. Without us, the Kirk family never would&#39;ve gotten so far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis turned toward Verena and Isaac, determination blazing in his eyes. &#34;Verena. Isaac. I swear to you-Sherwood will answer for everything he&#39;s done,&#34; Luis said, voice steady but trembling with the force of his resolve. His fists clenched so tightly his knuckles blanched, every muscle in his arms coiled with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac held Luis&#39; gaze, his tone measured but firm.&#34;There&#39;s no forgiveness for a man like Sherwood.I promise you, he&#39;ll face every consequence, down to the last.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stood silently beside them, watching the fire in Luis&#39; eyes, a swell of gratitude blooming inside her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped closer, her words gentle yet unyielding.&#34;Luis, we need your help to finish this. We came to discuss a plan with you. Sherwood has run free long enough, and now it&#39;s time for justice. We won&#39;t let him walk away from what he&#39;s done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s life had begun with hope-she was the child everyone in the family longed for, the center of their dreams. Before any of that love could reach her, she was stolen away and lost to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That loss never faded for Luis. The pain ran deeper each time he remembered it. He squeezed Verena&#39;s shoulder, meeting her gaze with unwavering conviction. &#34;You mean the world to me, Verena. No one will ever lay a hand on you again. I&#39;ll see to it personally that anyone who tries will regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Belonging washed over Verena, a feeling so powerful it stung her eyes with tears. She managed a shaky smile and nodded, voice soft with gratitude. &#34;I believe you,Luis.I always have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac stepped forward, enveloping her in a protective embrace. &#34;With the three of us standing together,there&#39;s no way Sherwood&#39;s getting away.&#34;</p>
