                <p>Once the call with Verena ended, Isaac kept his attention on the live stream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had told him she needed to deal with urgent matters, so spotting her on stage didn&#39;t catch him off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, after days of separation, with only a video call bridging the distance between them, seeing her appear through the broadcast felt strange and unexpected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the screen, Verena carried herself with a brilliance that seemed almost supernatural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s lips curved faintly, his eyes softening as they lingered on her image.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment Maxton uttered Evelyn&#39;s name, Katelyn hadn&#39;t dared to tear her gaze away from the broadcast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath caught when the camera cut to Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she possibly be there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What in the world was she planning?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s brows knitted tight as unease crawled through her chest, squeezing her heart until she could hardly breathe. The sense of dread prickled all the way to her scalp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whispers online calling Verena reckless and clueless for barging onto the stage didn&#39;t sit right with Katelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew from experience that Verena wasn&#39;t a woman who acted without purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking onto a stage of that magnitude without hesitation could only mean one thing...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought jolted her so badly that her complexion  drained of color. She quickly shook her head,muttering under her breath to calm herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no, that&#39;s impossible. It can&#39;t be true!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers clamped down on the table edge, nails dragging with a piercing screech. &#34;She&#39;s just some obscure doctor. There&#39;s no way she&#39;s Evelyn. If she really were, then all those times I flaunted myself in front of her, all my efforts to win over Danica,would have been nothing but a cruel joke to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn whispered to herself over and over, but each repetition sounded less certain than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She failed to notice the way her chin quivered or how all the color had drained from her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could accept losing to Verena who was shielded by lsaac, but to lose directly to Verena was unthinkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would make her nothing more than a fool in Verena&#39;s eyes since the beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in a shaky breath, Katelyn forced herself to  the idea that Verena could ever be Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had to be some other explanation for why Verena dared to step onto that stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze stayed locked on the broadcast, waiting anxiously for Verena to finally speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audience, too, leaned forward, their attention riveted to the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plenty of people who disliked Verena were convinced she couldn&#39;t possibly be Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They tuned in eagerly, hoping to see her stumble,humiliate herself, and get thrown out in disgrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every eye in the hall and watching the live stream bored into Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters, who watched with a mixture of pity and scorn, were bracing for the moment Maxton would rebuke her and have security escort her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, something no one could have predicted happened. Live on camera, Maxton&#39;s weathered face grew flushed, his eyes lit with unmistakable excitement,and he reached out to clasp Verena&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of Maxton eagerly holding onto her left the entire room stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had been expected to be her downfall suddenly turned into the most astonishing turn of events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in the room knew the name Maxton Fairclough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t just another wealthy man-he was Clokron&#39;s towering business legend, a figure whose reputation stretched far beyond the nation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, here he was, grasping the hand of a woman most had dismissed as insignificant, a woman with no public standing worth mentioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight left the reporters frozen, their jaws slack as if the scene defied reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One beat. Another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A third.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the sharp crack of a camera shutter.Click! Click...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound jolted the others, and suddenly the hall filled with frantic clicks as every reporter scrambled to capture the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their instincts told them this handshake was no simple courtesy. Maxton&#39;s eager expression, the spark in his eyes, spoke louder than words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This woman could not possibly be just Tobin&#39;s romantic partner whispered about in rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the Shoildon wealthy young people&#39;s group chat, the live broadcast sent shockwaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who had mocked Verena moments ago now felt an icy weight settle in their chests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maxton&#39;s demeanor made everything clear, and it was obvious to anyone with sense that he held Verena in high regard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, denial clung stubbornly to them; they wouldn&#39;t admit the truth until it was spoken outright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every eye in the hall and watching the live stream fixed on Verena once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remained steady on stage, her posture graceful,a faint smile curving her lips as she faced the cameras after Maxton released her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good day, everyone,&#34; she announced, her voice steady and confident. &#34;First of all, I want to express my gratitude to Mr. Maxton Fairclough for his generous words and for acknowledging my contributions to the field of medicine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maxton stood at her side with a warm smile, nodding several times in quiet agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But let me be clear,&#34; Verena said, her tone calm yet firm. &#34;Mr. Fairclough agreed to accept this interview so that certain rumors about me could be addressed.You&#39;ve all read the gossip linking me to Mr. Tobin Fairclough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The press stared at her, puzzled and eager to make sense of her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did she mean by &#34;Maxton acknowledging her contributions to the field of medicine&#34;?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she suddenly talking about rumors?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she admitting to being tied to Tobin...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait! No... Could it be that she was...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The implication hung heavily in the air, and the sharpest minds in the room already suspected the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s correct.&#34; Verena raised her voice just enough to carry through the room, her bright smile never faltering as she continued, &#34;Tobin and I are not involved in the way some might think. My presence here has nothing to do with that and is actually for another purpose. I&#39;m mainly here to oversee Maxton&#39;s treatment. However, Maxton became so enthusiastic about praising my work that he overlooked explaining the situation, so I felt it was better to step up and clarify things myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lighthearted tone carried a hint of humor,and it was only then that Maxton realized his excitement had led him to gush about her skills without addressing such an important point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her light remark drew a ripple of chuckles, while Maxton, realizing his oversight, rubbed his forehead in embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, that&#39;s exactly it. I let myself ramble and nearly forgot the main point,&#34; Maxton admitted with a hearty laugh before turning to the crowd. &#34;Allow me to clarify once and for all. This young lady is Evelyn Rowe, my attending doctor, and she has no connection to the gossip about my eldest son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The declaration stunned the audience. Jaws dropped, and the room filled with an almost audible gasp as the revelation settled in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn? She was Evelyn?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revelation left everyone stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elusive physician who had remained hidden for years was suddenly revealed as a strikingly young woman. Her appearance alone was enough to leave jaws hanging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The exposure of Evelyn&#39;s identity carried even more weight than the announcement of Maxton&#39;s recovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maxton&#39;s awakening was surprising, yes, but Smoothdeed Group had long been stable under Tobin&#39;s leadership, so his condition hadn&#39;t threatened the company&#39;s strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether he recovered or not, the group would have endured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Verena&#39;s identity surfaced, however,chaos broke out. Reporters swarmed forward,shoving microphones in her direction as if afraid to miss a single word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss, are you really Evelyn Rowe?&#34; one of them asked eagerly, his camera trained squarely on her,hoping for confirmation straight from her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s smile was radiant as she lifted her chin,meeting the camera with poise and unwavering confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With deliberate emphasis, she announced, &#34;Yes. I am Evelyn Rowe, and I came to Clokron for one reason-to treat Mr. Maxton Fairclough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There it was. The doctor whose face and background had remained a mystery, whose very name carried an almost legendary status among the wealthy,was standing before them in plain sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization was staggering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement lit up the reporters&#39; faces. Today was history in the making, and they were right there to capture it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Click! Click!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cameras went wild, flashes exploding across the room, yet Verena stood firm, her expression composed, her gaze steady as if the chaos around her couldn&#39;t touch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words echoed across the live broadcast: &#34;Yes. I am Evelyn Rowe, and I came to Clokron for one reason-to treat Mr.Maxton Fairclough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena&#39;s words carried through the live broadcast, Shoildon wealthy young people&#39;s group chat exploded with activity, and some quickly sent messages filled with excitement.</p>
