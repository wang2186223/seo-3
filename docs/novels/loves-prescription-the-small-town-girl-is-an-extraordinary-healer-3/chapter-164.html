                <p>Earlier,when the argument broke out, Danica had accidentally ended the call. Once she&#39;d left, Isaac noticed and immediately dialed Verena&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry about earlier, the call dropped by accident,&#34;Isaac said, his tone gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft laugh came from Verena&#39;s side. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it,&#34; she replied easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been wanting to bring something up, but Isaac jumped in first. &#34;What&#39;s your flight time tomorrow? I&#39;ll pick you up at the airport.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was warm, carrying a note of genuine care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had considered bringing up the earlier incident,but it was obvious Isaac preferred to let it slide. He was trying to protect her from any lingering awkwardness,but with Danica&#39;s voice ringing out so loudly earlier, it was impossible for Verena not to notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused for a moment, and then answered, &#34;I don&#39;t have the details yet. Once I get my ticket, I&#39;ll send you the info.&#34; &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll be waiting,&#34; Isaac responded, his voice reassuring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had never been one to dodge difficult topics,so she asked outright, &#34;Did your mom come by to give you a hard time after she read that news article from abroad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac hadn&#39;t planned on discussing it, but the way she phrased her question left no doubt she&#39;d caught part of his exchange with Danica.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, she did.&#34; He let out a quiet sigh, his frustration showing. &#34;My mom doesn&#39;t know the full story yet.She got upset after reading the news, and no matter how I tried to explain, she just wouldn&#39;t listen. Don&#39;t worry, though. When you&#39;re back, I&#39;ll go with you to clear things up. She&#39;s not totally unreasonable. She&#39;s just reacting to the shock of the news. Once she settles down, she won&#39;t be so harsh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mistrust was understandable. to Verena since she hadn&#39;t spent much time with Danica.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena kept her tone steady as she replied,&#34;You really don&#39;t need to worry about me. I can handle this myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still worried that she might feel hurt, Isaac offered a gentle promise. &#34;No matter what anyone says, Verena,I&#39;ll always be on your side.&#34; Something inside her softened. In that moment, it almost felt like nothing had changed. Isaac&#39;s faith in her was unshaken, just as it had been before his amnesia. Despite everything Danica had said and everything he&#39;d forgotten, he was still the same lsaac:trusting her completely, refusing to doubt her for even a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of emotion swept over Verena, and her eyes stung. She couldn&#39;t let him carry the burden by himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, asking Tobin to suppress the news wasn&#39;t enough; the truth needed to be made public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood that if she tried to clear things up after she returned home, no one except Isaac would be convinced. But if Tobin came forward with an official statement,it would carry real weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica might never accept her word, but she wouldn&#39;t question a public declaration from Tobin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, if she were simply Tobin&#39;s romantic partner,he wouldn&#39;t have publicly defended her and explained the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having reached a decision, Verena&#39;s lips curved into a small smile as she spoke into the phone. &#34;Thank you for always believing in me, sweetheart. I&#39;ve got something I need to take care of, so I&#39;ll talk to you  again soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word &#34;sweetheart&#34; caught lsaac off guard. His eyes brightened, and a quiet smile played on his lips.&#34;Alright, just be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, Verena stepped out of her room,determined to act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Tobin was still at his family&#39;s hospital,so she went directly to the medical wing at the back of the estate. After riding the elevator up,she spotted Tobin waiting alone on a bench at the far end of the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Fairclough,&#34; Verena greeted in a polite tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin shot to his feet, concern etched across his face.&#34;Evelyn, what brings you here? After everything you&#39;ve just been through these past few days, you should really be resting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a warm, reassuring smile, Verena replied, &#34;1wanted to talk to you about something important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin felt a deep sense of gratitude and admiration for the woman who had rescued his father&#39;s life,making him determined to keep their relationship on good terms. He understood better than anyone how unpredictable life could be, and no one was ever truly safe from unexpected tragedy. Even the best ddoctors had failed where she had succeeded, solving a problem others deemed hopeless. Building a strong relationship  with someone of her skill and character was a priority in both his personal and business affairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in, eager to help. &#34;Of course. What&#39;s on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena was just about to explain when chaos erupted.A nurse rushed out from the intensive care unit,her voice trembling with urgency. &#34;Mr. Fairclough, there&#39;s an emergency! It&#39;s your father&#39;s vitals; they&#39;re dropping once again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock froze Tobin in place. &#34;What did you say?&#34; he demanded,barely able to process the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of uncertainty and worry crossed Tobin&#39;s face as he glanced at Verena. Noticing his distress,Verena&#39;s brow creased with concern. &#34;Let me check on him,&#34; she said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she hurried after the nurse,heading straight into the ICU.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the monitors showed alarming drops in Maxton&#39;s vital signs. Wasting no time, Verena slipped into protective gear and moved to his bedside for a closer look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long for her to spot the problem. Earlier, after the operation, she&#39;d been forced to leave the final steps to her assistant so she could intercept Erick. It seemed likely that Maxton&#39;s setback was caused by the rushed and unfinished care he&#39;d received after surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling back the blanket and carefully inspecting the surgical area, Verena discovered a clear sign of infection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, the problem was discovered early enough to prevent any lasting damage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the nurse, Verena requested tweezers and other tools. Then she carefully cleaned the wound again and applied advanced treatment to steady Maxton&#39;s condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s quick actions paid off. Soon, Maxton&#39;s vital readings on the monitors began climbing back to normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once everything was under control, she peeled off her gown, mask, and gloves and stepped back out of the ICU.</p>
