                <p>A sly smile tugged at Sherwood&#39;s lips as he let his palm smack the tabletop, annoyance pulsing beneath the gesture. &#34;So that&#39;s how it is, Daren? You&#39;re not worried about the Sampson family; you just don&#39;t trust me.Luis wouldn&#39;t hand this off to anyone but me, but you keep treating me like some outsider.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Sherwood snatched his phone from his pocket, flicking through contacts with quick,sharp movements. &#34;If you&#39;re so desperate for proof,I&#39;ll get Luis&#39; right-hand man on the line right now.Maybe he can convince you. Sure, my family isn&#39;t the Sampson family,but everyone in Ochrerayd knows the bond we have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rose from his seat,jaw clenched in frustration,and let the chair screech loudly as he shoved it back. &#34;If you&#39;re set on doubting me, maybe we should call this off and stop wasting each other&#39;s time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made a show of turning toward the door, hand outstretched,already halfway out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of anxiety stirred in Daren&#39;s chest. But years spent maneuvering through the ruthless world of  business had taught him how to keep his composure,no matter how stormy things felt beneath the surface.Within seconds, he pushed the tension aside,steadying himself as his thoughts turned toward weighing every risk and advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew in a deep breath from his cigar before grinding it out in the ashtray with a firm hand. He understood just how rare a chance like this was.Working alongside the Sampson family didn&#39;t come often, and missing it might mean waiting years for anything close. Sherwood&#39;s payment terms carried their share of risks, but with the weight of the Sampson name behind it, locking in a long-term deal could send him climbing quickly through the ranks of the industry. On the other hand, if he pushed too hard and lost Sherwood now, the fallout wouldn&#39;t just be the loss of profit; it could mean crossing the Sampson family and bringing a storm he didn&#39;t need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Sherwood could leave, Daren shot to his feet,a new, eager smile plastered across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, Mr. Kirk, let&#39;s not be hasty! I misread the situation, and I&#39;ll admit it. You&#39;re absolutely right. Let&#39;s work it out your way. The payment terms are fine, and I want this partnership just as much as you do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the voice behind him made Sherwood scoff silently, though his face gave nothing away Daren had responded just as he expected. The  moment Sherwood brought the Sampson family into play, the outcome was already tilting in his favor.Businessmen were always chasing the next big opening, and Daren, despite being a seasoned schemer, wouldn&#39;t be able to resist for long.The promise of profit would eventually push him to weigh his choices and give in where it mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood kept his back turned, masking the satisfaction curling through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let the moment stretch, and then finally turned around,his features set in a stern mask, but a spark of victory lighting his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood let out a short sigh and fixed Daren with a steady gaze. &#34;I always pegged you for a man who didn&#39;t mince words,&#34; he said, voice even but edged with warning. &#34;For the sake of moving forward,I&#39;ll let this slide. But remember, when it comes to the Sampson family, there&#39;s no room for carelessness.Even one mistake could be costly for everyone involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing the distance, Sherwood joined Daren at the table, both men reclaiming their seats as if sealing an unspoken agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daren gave a slow, measured nod that struck a careful balance between modesty and quiet self-assurance. Every movement was deliberate, keeping  up the appearance of deference toward Sherwood while letting just enough of his street-smart edge slip through the cracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No worries, Mr. Kirk. My team and I will handle everything. You have my word that this deal is my only priority.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of curiosity crossed Daren&#39;s face. Swirling the wine in his glass, he glanced at Sherwood with a casual air, though his eyes were sharp and probing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me for asking, Mr. Kirk,&#34; he said, turning just enough to reach for the wine glass on the table. He lifted it and gave it a slow swirl, watching the liquid catch the light. &#34;If I&#39;m not mistaken, the Sampson family has always kept things clean around here.They&#39;ve never shown much interest in this kind of business before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped for a moment and lifted his eyes to Sherwood.The look seemed relaxed, but there was a sharpness hidden in it. &#34;Tell me, what made Luis suddenly decide to jump into this line of business?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood didn&#39;t answer right away. He reached for the glass of wine on the table and gave it a lazy swirl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dark red liquid shimmered beneath the light as it turned in slow circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting his head just slightly, he let a faint smile tug at the corners of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Big money changes people faster than anything else,&#34;said Sherwood. He let his gaze drift across Daren as if measuring him. &#34;And I&#39;m sure you know Isaac Bennett from Shoildon, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood leaned into the name,making sure it landed with weight. &#34;Luis&#39; sister just came back, and she&#39;s not someone who likes to play small. She and her husband have already planted their flag in Ochrerayd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a quiet smack of his lips and shook his head,looking like a man sighing at life&#39;s ironies. &#34;You know the saying. There can only be one at the top. Luis has no choice but to push back, and putting together money is just one of the ways he&#39;s planning to do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood lifted the glass to his mouth and took an unhurried sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daren kept his composure, though his thoughts moved quickly. He was no stranger to the Bennett family&#39;s reputation in Shoildon. Isaac had built their power with cold precision, stronger than those who came before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daren had heard plenty about Isaac&#39;s ruthless style,and he knew the man wasn&#39;t someone to cross. Then there was Verena, the Sampson family&#39;s daughter who had recently returned, already making waves of her  own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed a touch as he thought about the stories tied to her name. She was young, yet already seen as Isaac&#39;s equal. Her boldness had given her a reputation that few could ignore. Together, those two had made their entrance into Ochrerayd, and no one in the Sampson family could afford to dismiss them.Families like these always wore polite faces in public,but when money and power were at stake, blood ties never stopped them from turning into enemies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the thought made him sneer inside, Daren&#39;s expression softened into a charming smile as he looked back at Sherwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Kirk, you&#39;ve really given me clarity,&#34; said Daren,nodding as if grateful. &#34;If that&#39;s the case, we&#39;ll move according to your plan. We&#39;ll get things ready at once and make sure the shipment meets Mr. Sampson&#39;s expectations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, holding Sherwood&#39;s eyes with a confident grin. &#34;As for the payment, we&#39;ll follow whatever arrangements Mr. Sampson sets. His family is known for their precision, and I&#39;m sure every detail has already been thought through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word Daren spoke carried respect for the Sampson family, but beneath it lingered a quiet reminder that promises carried weight.</p>
