                <p>Verena was momentarily speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audacity it took for Katelyn to make such a bold declaration in front of Danica was almost shocking.During their last meeting, Katelyn had always skirted the truth, hinting at who she was but never saying it out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s sudden bold move clearly came from feeling cornered after her offer to treat lsaac was turned down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk tugged at the corners of Verena&#39;s mouth.&#39;&#34;SO,, Danica, are you truly convinced that Katelyn is Evelyn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed right ahead, not pausing for Danica&#39;s reply. &#34;But in the end, whether she&#39;s Evelyn or not isn&#39;t really the point. I already promised to give Isaac my all, and I&#39;m confident about his chances. The truth is,Isaac&#39;s sex function has been making incredible progress lately. Just yesterday, he was doing almost everything he could before. So I see no need to change doctors now, and I won&#39;t agree to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica heard those words and something clicked. Her hands reached for Verena&#39;s arm as she blurted out,&#34;Wait,do you mean Isaac is regaihing his potency? Are you serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when Verena last shared an update, Danica thought Isaac was still far from healthy. Now, the idea that he might be close to a full recovery left her speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena did her best to ignore the pain in her arm. She nodded, steady and calm.&#34;It&#39;s true. He&#39;s back to normal in terms of sex function. The only thing left is to confirm that his fertility is back as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she heard the answer repeated, Danica&#39;s joy washed over her, bringing a rush of color to her face as her eyes welled up with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy weight seemed to lift from her shoulders as the news sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile lingered, and she found herself thanking Verena again and again. &#34;Verena, it&#39;s amazing that you were able to help Isaac heal. I always believed my faith in you was justified.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, another worry came to mind. Danica turned quickly, voice hopeful and anxious. &#34;If his sex function is restored, what&#39;s happening with his legs now? How much longer before he&#39;s able to stand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doctors once thought there was no chance Isaac&#39;s legs would ever recover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rapid-fire questions tumbled out of Danica&#39;s mouth, leaving Verena unsure where to begin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hope shining in Danica&#39;s expression pushed Verena to be honest. &#34;I&#39;m giving Isaac&#39;s legs my all, but the progress has been slow,&#34; she admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer drained the excitement from Danica&#39;s face. &#34;So you&#39;re saying there hasn&#39;t been much improvement yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena exhaled and nodded. &#34;It&#39;s true that things are moving slowly, but we&#39;re on the right track. The goal is to get his condition stable enough for surgery. Once we reach that point, you&#39;ll see real change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of disappointment settled over Danica as she listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had managed to resolve Isaac&#39;s other health issues, but when it came to his legs, there were still no guarantees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long pause followed before Danica spoke again. &#34;Verena, I do appreciate everything you&#39;re doing for Isaac. Still, I plan to move forward with what I decided.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena met her gaze, and Danica continued, &#34;Katelyn already mentioned having a talk with you. I know you&#39;re worried about how close she and Isaac once were, and that&#39;s why you&#39;d rather keep her away.I get it.But not everything is about that. I have no intention of coming between you and Isaac. All I want is for Katelyn to be his doctor-nothing more. You&#39;re the one he&#39;s married to, the person he&#39;ll spend his life with.I know you want to see him recover as soon as possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking Verena&#39;s hand, Danica tried to appeal to both her heart and her head. &#34;You know the name Evelyn Rowe-she&#39;s practically a legend in the medical field. Katelyn&#39;s skills are top-notch, and letting her treat Isaac is the best move for him. I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll put aside any doubts about Katelyn and let her help. Maybe you could even convince Isaac to accept her treatment.&#34; After listening to Danica, Verena couldn&#39;t help but admire Katelyn&#39;s silver tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena slowly pulled her hand back. &#34;Danica, no one wants isaac to recover more than I do. But you&#39;re wrong about Katelyn. She isn&#39;t who she claims to be. There are things I can&#39;t share yet, but one thing I know for certain-Katelyn is not Evelyn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words had barely left her mouth when Danica retorted, &#34;That&#39;s nonsense!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s expression hardened. &#34;Professor Wendell Branson worked side by side with Evelyn in Clokron. He personally confirmed Katelyn is her. Verena, I understand you don&#39;t want Katelyn near Isaac, but accusing her of lies only hurts your credibility. I&#39;ve known that girl since childhood. She has her flaws, but she wouldn&#39;t risk inventing something so easily disproven.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell Branson&#39;s name stopped Verena cold. Why would he vouch for Katelyn of all people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell&#39;s reputation was built on honesty. A man like him would never cover for Katelyn unless... she had backed him into a corner and forced him to lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization sank in, and Verena understood just how dangerous Katelyn really was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice steadied as she faced Danica again. &#34;I have no reason to slander her. If you choose to believe Katelyn instead of me, that&#39;s your decision. But Isaac&#39;s condition is too serious to gamble on. Another failed attempt will make things worse for him. I will never allow her to treat him. If you want to convince lsaac otherwise, then speak with him directly, because I won&#39;t help you sway him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica stared at her as though she didn&#39;t recognize her anymore. &#34;What are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her frustration boiled over. &#34;You&#39;re being unbelievably stubborn! Precisely because Isaac can&#39;t afford another failure, I want someone more dependable to take over. Andyet you cling to this out of jealousy. Fine,if you won&#39;t listen, I&#39;ll talk to Isaac myself. I won&#39;t waste another word on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spun on her heel and stormed off, the sweep of her dress tailing behind her like a final word unspoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left behind, Verena sat still, her mind circling back to the troubling matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell had publicly vouched for Katelyn, calling her Evelyn. That thought tightened Verena&#39;s eyes as suspicion stirred within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for the phone resting on the table and dialed quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Wendell was leaving the lecture hall, papers tucked under his arm, heading toward his office.His phone buzzed in his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caller ID showed no name, just an unknown number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With little hesitation, he accepted the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello? Who&#39;s calling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smooth, unmistakable female voice drifted through the line. &#34;Professor Branson, it&#39;s been a long time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound stopped Wendell mid-step, so abruptly that a passing student nearly collided with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The student offered a quick greeting, and Wendell returned a distracted nod before veering into a quieter corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice wavered with disbelief. &#34;Evelyn... is that really you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft reply confirmed it.&#34;Yes. It&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell&#39;s hand grew damp around the phone. From the moment he allowed Katelyn to use Evelyn&#39;s name and backed her with his false testimony, he had dreaded the day he might be confronted by Evelyn herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never imagined the real Evelyn would seek him out this quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn had never relied on a fixed number, and he should have recognized that from the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the call was already live, and hanging up now would only make things worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even through the static of the line, Wendell&#39;s chest tightened with guilt, the weight of shame pressing down harder than he cared to admit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts scattered until Verena&#39;s calm voice cut through. &#34;Professor Branson, let&#39;s meet this afternoon -same place as always.&#34; The simple request made his stomach twist, and his first instinct was to back out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelyn, I... this afternoon I&#39;m supposed to be at the school,&#34; he stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reply came smoothly, leaving him no room to hide. &#34;I already checked. You&#39;re free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell froze, realizing once again how easily Evelyn uncovered the smallest details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a stretch of silence, he said nothing, until her voice returned, lighter this time. &#34;Good. Then we&#39;ll meet.See you later.&#34;</p>
