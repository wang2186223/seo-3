                <p>Luis gently set down the small spoon and leaned back in his chair, his eyes still fastened on Verena,as though waiting for her response-or perhaps simply studying how she would take his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena caught the playful glint beneath his gaze. Her face remained composed, her heart unruffled, like still water untouched by wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted slightly, her voice cool and firm.&#34;It&#39;s not shameful for a man to fall for a woman. But knowing well that I am already married, and still nursing such thoughts, still speaking such words-that, Mr. Sampson, is truly shameful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis faltered for a heartbeat, and then offered a smile that neither agreed nor denied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning to the matter at hand, Verena said evenly &#34;Enough circling around. Let&#39;s get straight to the heart of it. Who is it you&#39;re trying to protect? Can you finally tell me now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis did not delay further. He reached for the document folder resting on the nearby chair, the one containing detailed information about his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at that moment, a server passed by their table with a tray holding a steaming cup of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether the floor betrayed him with its slick&lt;surface or his own haste did, his foot slipped. He lost balance, the tray tipped, and the cup spilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scalding liquid splashed directly toward Verena,a small portion striking her leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; A sharp gasp escaped her lips, her brows knitting instantly as pain seared her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The server blanched. He set down the tray in a flurry,bowing deeply, words tumbling out in panic. &#34;I&#39;m terribly sorry! I truly am! It was my carelessness.This order will be on the house-please forgive me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s frown flickered, and then softened into calm. She waved lightly. &#34;It&#39;s fine. Just be more careful next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The server, greatly relieved, hurried to clean the mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis quickly drew out a few napkins and handed them across the table. Verena lifted her gaze, saw his hand extended, and murmured, &#34;Thank you.&#34; She accepted the napkins and lifted the hem of her dress slightly to blot the spill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her movements were swift, almost anxious, for the burn still stung her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis leaned forward, intending to show concern,but his eyes caught upon her left leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That one glance struck him like lightning. His breath stilled; his pupils widened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just above her knee was a scar-shaped unmistakably like a butterfly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shape, the placement-it pierced him to the core. A single thought burst through him. Was she...his sister?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart raced. After only a second, his eyes hardened with certainty. He was almost sure-the woman before him was the sister he had sought for more than a decade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That scar was no coincidence. He had caused it himself all those years ago. The memory was carved into his bones, impossible to forget,even in death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis stared, breath growing ragged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her. It was truly her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, the puzzles of the past seemed to fall into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder, from the very first meeting, he had felt a pull toward her-a bond unspoken, a comfort that made him want to linger at her side, to confide his heart without reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder, even when he had agreed to help Simon against Isaac, he found himself recoiling at the thought of harming her once he knew she was Isaac&#39;s wife. His hands had resisted, his heart refusing to see her hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was because this woman-this source of strange,inexplicable emotions-was none other than his own sister, the one he had longed for since childhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest swelled with a storm: wild joy at what was found, bitter regret for nearly harming her. Hope and shame twisted together,leaving him adrift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a thought froze him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had he just said to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis snapped back. A wave of embarrassment crashed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had actually told her to leave her husband-to come to him. To her own brother! The thought was absurd,monstrous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His stomach churned; he cursed himself silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The folder in his hand now burned like hot iron. Should he still hand it to her, or withdraw it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers clenched it so tightly the edges bent and creased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassment and regret gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Verena discovered that the man spouting such reckless words was her brother, how would she see him? Would she not shrink back in disgust?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she was only a stranger, it mattered little if she mistook him for a man shameless enough to covet another&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now-now she was his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could even rebuild the bond fate had severed, he had already tainted it with folly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Verena remained unaware of the tempest on his face. She bowed her head, quietly tending to her dress, dabbing away the stain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finished, she raised her hand, reaching for the folder he still held. But just as her fingers brushed close, Luis recoiled as though the file had scorched him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena blinked, startled. Her puzzled gaze rose to him. &#34;Mr. Sampson, what do you mean by this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis could not meet her eyes. His gaze darted everywhere else, his voice faltering. &#34;I-I suddenly remembered something urgent. I must go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could reply, he rose abruptly and fled the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His departing figure was steeped in panic, as though pursued by his own shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena sat still, dazed by his hasty flight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment ago, he had been perfectly calm.Why then did he leave as if chased by fire?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow furrowed as she mulled over his inexplicable behavior, but no answer came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, she sighed. Some riddles could not be solved at once. She straightened her dress, made sure no obvious marks remained, and then left the restaurant and drove back toward the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Bennett Group, Jacob held a folder in his hands as he reported to Isaac, &#34;Mr. Bennett, the arrangements have been made.&#34;</p>
