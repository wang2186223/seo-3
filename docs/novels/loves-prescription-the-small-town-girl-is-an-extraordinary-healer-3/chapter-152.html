                <p>Verena started to get up to plug in her phone, but before she could take more than a step, Isaac reached out and caught her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle pull, he guided her closer, settling her right in the space between his knees, refusing to let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her mouth to say something, but his arms wrapped around her waist, holding her tight, and he pressed his face softly into her stomach,clinging to her for comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, Verena ran her fingers lightly through his hair. &#34;Is something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being close to her like this was the only way lsaac could convince himself that she truly belonged to him and that no one else had a claim on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth of her voice, the slight tremor as she spoke, gave him a peace he found nowhere else,and he pressed his cheek even closer, finding solace in her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he dwelled on it, the tighter his grip became. Isaac let his lashes fall, hiding the redness in his eyes.&#34;It&#39;s nothing. I only wanted to hold you,&#34; he murmured softly, his voice carrying a faint hum that betrayed none of the storm inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Believing he was simply exhausted, Verena cupped his soft head and stroked it gently, letting him embrace her however he wished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft buzzing came from her pocket moments later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac,however, showed no sign of letting go, keeping his head against her and his arms snug around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to disturb himn, Verena let him stay as he was, reaching into her pocket to pull out her phone.After a glance at the screen, she answered, &#34;Gavin,what&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin&#39;s voice came through. &#34;You remember asking me to look for a good plot in Shoildon for the hospital you&#39;re planning? I found one. Come by when you&#39;re free and take a look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Gavin was no longer serving as Verena&#39;s assistant, she still relied on him out of habit and briefly forgot he no longer held that role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin, still eager to be of help thanks to all he&#39;d learned from her, had volunteered himself to track  down a suitable site for the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flickered in Verena&#39;s eyes. &#34;I honestly thought it&#39;d take ages. You really found one this fast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin answered with a playful tone, &#34;Of course. You know who mentored me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena let out a soft laugh. &#34;You can&#39;t flatter me like that. I don&#39;t deserve it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some background noise buzzed through the line, but soon faded, making it clear Gavin had stepped away for a quieter spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came back on the line. &#34;The site&#39;s picked, so just let me know when you want to see it. If you need anything else, don&#39;t hesitate to call. I have to get going for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave a small nod.&#34;Alright,thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t mention it,&#34; Gavin answered her with a warm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended quickly, and Isaac had caught every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up at Verena. &#34;So, you&#39;re planning to open a hospital?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena didn&#39;t try to conceal it and gave a nod. &#34;Since  I&#39;ve returned from abroad, it&#39;s time to bring the medical team here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac fell silent for a moment, his gaze turning thoughtful. &#34;Building a hospita takes a lot of work.Have you managed to get all the permits? I could have Jacob help you out. If there&#39;s anything you need,just let him know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched her with hope in his eyes, wanting to be involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena smiled despite herself and ran her hand through his hair. &#34;I appreciate it, but there&#39;s no need.Gavin has already taken care of everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sounded so cheerful and carefree, her smile shining, but to Isaac it felt like something sharp had just pierced his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked hard, feeling a heat rise behind his eyes,so he pressed his face back against her, hiding any sign of his pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet moment passed before he finally nodded,offering a weak smile that faded before it reached his eyes.His words came out strained. &#34;Alright, I get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac often resented this part of himself, aware that ever since meeting Verena, his heart had grown more delicate and easily shaken.  Some days,he was certain Verena loved him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But other days, it felt like she only cared for him,never truly needing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea that he might be disposable crept in,threatening to unravel all the confidence he had built.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That realization broke through the fragile sense of security he&#39;d built, leaving his heart unsteady and leaving him uncertain about what to do next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never wanted Verena to notice these feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He worried that she would tire of having to handle his emotions, or worse, decide she needed to leave altogether.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Isaac kept it hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the silence, Verena suggested, &#34;Isaac, let&#39;s head to the medical room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac understood what she meant and loosened his grip on her,answering softly, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the medical room, Verena supported Isaac as he eased onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She began by gently performing a treatment session on his legs, and then carefully applied her own herbal remedy below his abdomen. While she sat nearby, Verena watched every reaction in his body, making sure nothing went unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the treatment finished, she made careful notes in her notebook, documenting the results.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bright smile spread across her face as she turned to him. &#34;Isaac, today&#39;s session was just to reinforce the recovery of your sex function. The last treatment for your condition was the final round. Your sex function has made a full recovery.&#34; she announced, her eyes sparkling with excitement. &#34;Do you know what that means?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A puzzled look crossed Isaac&#39;s face as he tried to understand her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning closer, Verena lowered her voice, her gaze fixed on him. &#34;It means you can enjoy a normal sex life now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That simple truth hit lsaac like a wave, stirring his heart in a way he couldn&#39;t hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet smile touched his lips as he reached up,his thumb tracing the soft curve of her cheek. &#34;Is that true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he was asking her, or maybe he just needed to hear it out loud.Thinking he might be doubting himself, Verena quickly reassured him. &#34;Absolutely! You&#39;re fully recovered.Hmm...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t get to finish, as Isaac&#39;s lips captured hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the longing in his eyes, Verena returned his kiss, her arms slipping around his neck, deepening the connection between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That simple gesture sent heat racing through Isaac,lighting him up inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a firm but gentle grip, he pulled Verena onto the bed,drawing her closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lay beside him, cheeks flushed and eyes shining with unshed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac moved in for another kiss, but she stopped him with a soft hand on his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion flickered across his face, mixed with the slightest hint of disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s smile turned playful, her voice gentle and sweet. &#34;Isaac,I really like you doing this to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes sparkled with mischief, and her lips curled into a teasing grin.</p>
