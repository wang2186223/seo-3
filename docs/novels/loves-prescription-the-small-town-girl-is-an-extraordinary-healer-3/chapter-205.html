                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes flickered for an instant, and he hesitated before a gentle smile curved his lips. Reaching out he tucked a stray lock of hair behind Verena&#39;s ear and murmured,&#34;I&#39;m not nervous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, that was a lie. Inside, his heart was a tangled knot of nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, seeing Verena already on edge, he feared that if he admitted his own unease, it would only weigh her down further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Verena knew him like the back of her hand. How could she not see through the thoughts he tried to hide?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised their clasped fingers, laying bare his disguise. &#34;But your palms are damp, and you&#39;re holding me as though my hand were the only rope keeping you from drowning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Isaac instinctively tried to loosen his grip, Verena.held on even tighter, her touch steady and strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac, being nervous is only human. There&#39;s no shame in admitting it. And even,if we don&#39;t have a child this time, there will be many chances ahead. We have a lifetime together, don&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The firmness of her grip and the calm in her words washed over him like balm, easing the storm inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was right-time was on their side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,when faced with the woman he loved most, Isaac was stripped of his composure and left simply an ordinary man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>白</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At times, he foolishly clung to the idea that a child would be the bond tying them forever, proof she would never walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing how childish that thought was, he silently rebuked himself before answering, &#34;You&#39;re right. Sooner or later, it will happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they waited for the results, Isaac never left Verena&#39;s side. Jacob received several urgent calls, yet any project that demanded Isaac&#39;s presence wvas either turned down or postponed without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two hours later, the doctor finally called Verena&#39;s name and handed her the test report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a warm smile, he announced, &#34;Congratulations! According to the results, Mrs. Bennett is indeed pregnant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, Isaac froze, stunned as though time itself had stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, his eyes lit up, and a smile too bright to suppress broke across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clutched Verena&#39;s hand and looked at her, his voice trembling.&#34;Verena... we&#39;re going to have a baby. Is it real?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze overflowed with joy and disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since the accident, he had not dared to dream of a child of his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, the words he had longed for struck his ears like music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news was as beautiful as a dream to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a blessing so dazzling he could hardly trust it, afraid that if he blinked, it would vanish like a dream at A dawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena handed him the report, her eyes alight with warmth and happiness.&#34;It&#39;s true, Isaac. We&#39;re going to be parents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the doctor had witnessed countless couples rejoice over such news, he couldn&#39;t help but be moved by the depth of their emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling, he added a gentle reminder. &#34;For now, everything looks normal. But in the days ahead, Mr. Bennett,please pay close attention to your wife&#39;s diet and rest. Regular check-ups will be essential for a smooth pregnancy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac,still reeling from the joy, absorbed the words slowly before nodding firmly. &#34;I will always look after my wife&#39;s health. Thank you, doctor.&#34; After the consultation, Jacob drove the car up from the underground parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena guided Isaac out of the elevator, pushing his wheelchair gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he saw Jacob, Isaac broke into a wide smile. &#34;Jacob, I&#39;m going to be a father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes shimmered with hope, filled with a light that spoke of boundless anticípation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching on at once, Jacob offered heartfelt congratulations. &#34;Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. You&#39;ll have the healthiest, brightest, and most adorable baby in the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena returned his words with genuine gratitude. &#34;Thank you for your blessing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, still concealing the full tide of excitement within him, gave an instruction brimming with generosity.&#34;Jacob, arrange for all employees&#39; salaries to be increased by twenty percent this month, along with an additional bonus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was his way of sharing joy with the entire company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob&#39;s eyes brightened at the news of a bonus, and he bowed deeply. &#34;Thankyou, Mr.Bennett.I&#39;ll spread the good news at once.&#34;</p>
