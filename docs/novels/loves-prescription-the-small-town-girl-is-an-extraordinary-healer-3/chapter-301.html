                <p>Seeing the lingering sadness in Isaac&#39;s eyes, Verena recalled Luther&#39;s counsel: create more chances for Isaac to rise and even run to her. And whenever despair crept in from his inability to walk, she needed to steer him away from self-reproach,to pull him from that pit before it swallowed himn whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, Verena slid lightly onto his lap,leaning close until the tip of her nose brushed his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s body stiffened in surprise at the sudden intimacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of astonishment crossed his eyes, soon giving way to an emotion stirred only by Verena&#39;s nearness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned in, the space between them dwindling to almost nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So close now, their hearts seemed to echo each other -racing,stumbling,and then finding the same rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting her chin, she drew nearer to his ear, her breath feather-light against him, teasing as a whisper of wind.With a voice soft enough to melt into the air, she murmured,&#34;I want to know... how do you feel here?&#34; Even as she spoke, her hand slipped beneath the fabric of his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze deepened, intensity pooling in those eyes fixed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breathing grew uneven, as though words lodged in his throat,refusing to surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hand on her waist instinctively gripped tighter, as if to anchor this luminous figure and forbid any distance from returning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He parted his lips, but speech faltered; finally, in a husky rasp, he managed, &#34;Verena, you... what are you ...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question trembled, but it was laced less with doubt than with the enchantment she had awakened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lips curved with quiet triumph.Her head tilted,her eyes gleaming with playful affection as she whispered again at his ear, &#34;Lost for words?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s lips quivered, his breath broken and heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice, rough yet charged with desire barely reined in, tumbled out, &#34;Verena, you... you&#39;re going to make me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to say she was going to make him lose  every shred of control, but before he could finish, she lowered her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A burst of light seemed to explode in Isaac&#39;s mind, like fireworks scattering across a midnight sky. Every thought collapsed into chaos, and the world narrowed until there was nothing left but Verena&#39;s face,dangerously close and irresistibly vivid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost without thought, his arm coiled tightly around her slender waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other hand rose urgently yet tenderly to cradle her head,drawing her in until no gap remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only in such closeness did it feel as though they could become whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,the tide of control began to shift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, swept in the same current, looped her arm around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her other hand stirred lightly-then came a crisp sound in the stillness of the study. His belt was unbuckled. The sudden note jolted Isaac, a spark of electricity that cut through the haze, dragging his reason back from the brink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath tore out in gasps, his chest heaving,sweat gathering along his brow.With trembling restraint, he caught her hand mid-motion. &#34;Verena, no...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips drew back from his, her gaze steady on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac, I want to be closer to you.Is that so wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes shimmered like dew, and his heart lurched at the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any other day, he would never have denied her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding his teeth, resignation etched across his features, he sighed and lowered his gaze to her swelling belly. His voice, hoarse and torn, said only,&#34;The baby...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena froze for a breath, but the sparkle in her eyes did not fade-it brightened, mischievous and resolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in once more, she cupped his face between her palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile carried both pride and teasing warmth.&#34;Don&#39;t forget,I&#39;m a doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat surged through lsaac&#39;s chest, threatening to burst out in flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He trusted her judgment-she knew the boundaries  better than anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even knowing that, he could not trust himself.</p>
