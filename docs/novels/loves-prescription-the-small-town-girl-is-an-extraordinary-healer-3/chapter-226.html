                <p>Isaac pressed his lips together and instructed firmnly through the phone, &#34;Jacob, find out what type of men Simon fancies. I need the answer now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob answered without delay, &#34;Understood, Mr.Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the call ended, Jacob leapt into action.Barely twenty minutes passed before he rang back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac picked up, and Jacob&#39;s voice came crisply over the receiver. &#34;Mr. Bennett, according to what I&#39;ve gathered so far,he seems to prefer men who are neat and well-mannered,with gentle features.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neat and well-mannered, with gentle features...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac straightened, his fingers tightening around the phone as the image of a clean-cut, striking face flickered through his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips curved faintly. In a composed tone, he instructed, &#34;I see. Keep tracking his movements closely and inform me at once if anything changes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he ended the call, his gaze drifting toward the window as if weighing invisible scales.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief silence, he dialed another number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line clicked, and Slater&#39;s casual voice came through. &#34;Hello,Isaac?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac drew in a breath before speaking directly.&#34;Slater,I need your help. Would you be willing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater answered without hesitation, his tone resolute,&#34;Of course. You&#39;re my friend, almost like an older brother. We may not share blood, but we grew up side by side. Back then, whenever Bobby and I caused trouble, you took the blame for us. Helping you now is the least I can do. For your sake, I&#39;d walk through fire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater might sound slick, but beneath the polish lay genuine loyalty. His words, while dramatic, carried no falsehood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Isaac,he had always been like a younger brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at Isaac&#39;s lips as he drawled,&#34;No danger involved. I simply need you to test someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Test someone?&#34; Slater echoed with curiosity. &#34;Who is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac forwarded Simon&#39;s photo. &#34;This man is rumored to be interested in men. I need confirmation.Approach him a few times, keep it subtle, but make sure there&#39;s some physical contact. Watch carefully  how he responds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater stared at the photo in silence, his voice eventually breaking the pause, laced with surprise and discomfort. &#34;Isaac, you want me to test a guy? And he&#39;s into men? Did I hear that right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows knitted as he studied the picture,muttering,&#34;His eyes... they look shifty, like someone scheming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac knew the request was no easy pill for a straight man to swallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled softly. &#34;I realize this isn&#39;t simple, but you&#39;re the only one who can manage it. Truly, you&#39;re my best option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater&#39;s brows furrowed until they nearly touched.&#34;Isaac, at least tell me-what&#39;s the purpose?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze sharpened. His voice lowered. &#34;Forgive me, but it&#39;s not something I can explain now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence pressed in again. Slater&#39;s forehead creased deeply. Inside,he wrestled with the task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would risk danger for lsaac without hesitation,but this-approaching a man attracted to men-felt like climbing a wall higher than any peril.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At length, he let out a long sigh. &#34;Alright. You&#39;re like a brother to me. I&#39;ll shoulder this challenge.&#34; A gleam softened lsaac&#39;s eyes at his agreement.&#34;Thank you, Slater. I know this isn&#39;t easy. Think of it as a favor for me. When the day comes, I&#39;ll return it without fail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Isaac had been away from Verena&#39;s bedside for a while, he kept the call brief, ending after confirming the matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant the line went dead, Slater collapsed into his gaming chair, clutching his head as he groaned,&#34;Good grief! What mess have I landed myself in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat there, brooding for a moment, and then sighed in resignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The die had been cast-he couldn&#39;t back out now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But charming women had always been second nature to him; trying to win over a man was an entirely different battlefield. The very thought made him shudder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alone, he knew he wouldn&#39;t survive this test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how he looked at it, he needed a strategist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But who?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He narrowed his eyes, flipping through mental images of his friends. Suddenly, one face popped into focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snapped upright, eyes wide. &#34;Bobby&#39;s always full of schemes. Talking this through with him might just work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting another second, he typed out a quick message. &#34;Hey Bobby, need to discuss something.Meet me at the usual spot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby, already online, replied at once with an &#34;OK&#34;emoji.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, the two met in a chic café.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what&#39;s the deal?&#34; Bobby asked lazily, lounging with one leg crossed over the other, his attention glued to a game on his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater parted his lips, hesitant. &#34;Could you...help me figure out how to win someone over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby sipped his coffee, still absorbed in his screen,assuming it was just another girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is she?&#34; he asked absently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater, awkward, pulled up the photo on his phone and held it out. &#34;This person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Bobby&#39;s character neared defeat, his fingers flew faster. Hearing Slater&#39;s words, he glanced briefly at the photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Handsome,Bobby thought-then froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His casual mask shattered. His phone slipped from his hands and clattered to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A passing waiter kindly retrieved it, but Bobby was too stunned to thank him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widened as he gaped at Slater, jaw slack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few beats later, he burst out, &#34;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater darted nervous glances around, relieved the café wasn&#39;t crowded. Otherwise, the scene would have been mortifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hissed under his breath, &#34;Keep it down, will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can l?&#34; Bobby exclaimed, his voice trembling.&#34;This is earth-shattering! Since when are you into guys?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought spun in his head, almost too much to digest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with mock suspicion, he clutched his chest.&#34;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve had your eyes on me all along.Good thing I&#39;m straight-otherwise, who knows?&#34; Slater rolled his eyes at Bobby&#39;s shamelessness. &#34;I&#39;ve been straight for over twenty years! This is lsaac&#39;s assignment.&#34; He shoved the phone toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby blinked in disbelief. &#34;My brother asked you to do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater nodded firmly. &#34;Exactly. Otherwise, do you think I&#39;d be chasing after a man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby narrowedhis gaze. &#34;Didmy brotherexplain why?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater shrugged. &#34;He said it&#39;s confidential for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see.&#34; Bobby rubbed his chin thoughtfully. &#34;If it&#39;s from my brother, he must have his reasons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater stared at him, almost laughing at the double standard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Slater had volunteered this, Bobby mocked him endlessly. But the moment Isaac was involved, Bobby flipped sides like a coin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater shook his head, feeling their friendship weighed down by bias.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the main issue loomed. He sighed. &#34;The truth is,I have no interest in men at all. That&#39;s why I need your advice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby eyed him suspiciously. &#34;As if I&#39;d be interested.&#34; Slater gave a wry grin. &#34;But you always come up with plenty of ideas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby didn&#39;t argue. He took the phone, studying the photo with a measured gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Handsome,&#34; he admitted slowly. &#34;But something about him doesn&#39;t sit right. He looks like trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater agreed instantly. &#34;Exactly what I thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the way,&#34; Bobby asked curiously,&#34;why would Isaac choose you of all people?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater shook his head. &#34;NNo idea. He just said I&#39;m the best option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The best option?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby shifted his gaze back to Slater, his grin spreading with mischief.</p>
