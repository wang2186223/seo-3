                <p>Katelyn&#39;s jaw clenched tight, fury blazing in her chest,her eyes smoldering with defiance as a storm of tangled emotions coiled around her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger,fear, and pride gnawed at her ribs like restless wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s warning left her cornered. She knew he wasn&#39;t bluffing, and she also knew the Bennetts carried enough weight to crush the Fullers without lifting a finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her parents were already brokenhearted because of her disgrace. She couldn&#39;t let them bleed further on her account-and she couldn&#39;t afford to lose the one thing that kept her afloat: her place as the Fuller heiress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For her, the road had narrowed into a dead end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if her reputation crumbled, her status had to remain untouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without the Fuller family, she would be reduced to nothing but dust in the wind. Her parents might be disappointed now, but she was still their only daughter. Whatever storms came, they would never truly cast her aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting down her humiliation, Kately forced herself to yield. &#34;Isaac, you win. I&#39;ve lost. From today on,I won&#39;t go after Verena again. But remember your word-don&#39;t lay a finger on my parents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words left her mouth, but her heart refused to bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the storm passed, she vowed she would strike back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac read her too well. His voice remained steady, like cold iron. &#34;I don&#39;t believe you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage flared in her eyes, and she snapped, her voice breaking into a shout. &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?Didn&#39;t you call just to make me promise to leave Verena alone? I&#39;ve already agreed! What more do you want from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s tone cut like frost. &#34;Leave the couuntry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind stalled for two seconds before panic spilled out. &#34;Isaac, you&#39;re driving me to the edge! You leaked the news-you know the hospital director&#39;s wife has the underworld in her palm. She&#39;s merciless. If I leave now, I won&#39;t even make it out alive! I can&#39;t leave!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s voice stayed cold, every word deliberate.&#34;Whether you live or die is not my concern. All I want is for you to leave this country. Clokron is not your only path-choose any place you like. Just never show your face here again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His stance was unyielding, leaving no room for plea or compromise.Katelyn realized nothing she said would shake him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding her teeth, she finally muttered, &#34;My passport&#39;s expired. Give me a week to prepare. Once time&#39;s up, I&#39;ll leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While scandal roared across Akoitha like wildfire,Clokron was quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Fairclough estate, Verena had just finished washing up when a servant came dashing toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Verena asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant panted, breathless with excitement.&#34;Evelyn, Maxton-he&#39;s awake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the words hit her ears, Verena didn&#39;t hesitate.She hurried toward the hospital in the estate. Tobin&#39;s eyes lit up when he spotted her. Relief flooded his face as he rushed forward. &#34;Evelyn, my father just woke up. Please, examine him-see if there are any complications.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena slipped on the sterile gown and mask a nurse handed her. &#34;Very well, Mr. Fairclough. I&#39;ll go in and check. Wait outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin nodded at once, his whole face glowing with hope.&#34;Yes,yes-thank you,Evelyn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty minutes later, Verena pushed open the ward door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin darted forward, his voice anxious. &#34;There&#39;s nothing else wrong with him, is there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Removing her mask, Verena offered a reassuring smile.&#34;He&#39;s recovering well. Only some post-op precautions remain-I&#39;ve already explained them to the other doctors. For now, simply spend more time with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that there were no other complications, Tobin exhaled deeply, relief and admiration mingling in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice brimmed with gratitude. &#34;Evelyn, please,make more requests. I want to repay you properly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my duty,&#34; she replied calmly. After a pause,  she added, &#34;I ask only one thing-when your father regains strength, stand beside him before the media.Tell them clearly that I was here to treat him, and that the treatment succeeded.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin nodded without hesitation, almost stumbling over his words. &#34;Of course! You needn&#39;t even request it-we&#39;ll proclaim this good news ourselves!&#34; Later, back in her room,Verena called Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac, I&#39;ve got good news,&#34; she said with a quiet smile.&#34;Maxton is awake. A few more days of rest, and he&#39;ll be ready to face the press with Tobin. Once the truth is out, no one will dare mock you or the Bennetts again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac knew Maxton-one of the great legends of commerce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had heard of his illness, but never dreamed Verena would cure in mere days what had baffled countless doctors for months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tide of pride, joy, and astonishment surged through his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t doubt in her skill, but awe-she had accomplished what others could only call impossible.To him, it was nothing short of a miracle. From the heart, Isaac praised her. &#34;You&#39;re remarkable.You must have hardly rested. It&#39;s been hard on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena laughed softly, accepting the compliment.&#34;I&#39;ve rested well enough. I was only worried you&#39;d be troubled by the rumors swirling about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was gentle, almost languid, as though she were leaning against the pillows while she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lowered his eyes. He knew she was worried about how he was affected by the rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he, in turn, had kept her shielded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t mentioned that Katelyn was behind the rumors, nor that strangers had maligned her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want her weighed down by shadows while she worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that the matter was settled, she would soon return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac steadied his heart, his gaze unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a voice low and steady, he confessed, &#34;It&#39;s been too long since I&#39;ve seen you. I miss you. How much longer before you come back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone dipped at the end, faintly pleading.The sound  brushed against her heart like a whispered secret. Verena touched her ear, her cheeks flushing with warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Soon. At most, three days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, and then added gently, &#34;Isaac,there&#39;s something you don&#39;t know. I&#39;ll tell you in person when I&#39;m back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was time-time he learned she was Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assassination attempts had been one reason for silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the greater reason lay in her own trembling hands.She hadn&#39;t been sure she could heal Isaac swiftly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew the name Evelyn. Everyone knew the legend attached to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had taken on that identity yet failed to cure him after a long treatment, the disappointment would have crushed both Isaac and Danica.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of such expectation might have hindered his recovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, back then, she hadn&#39;t been strong enough to withstand the pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, she had once failed someone she loved. She couldn&#39;t risk failing again. But now, her hands were steady and she had saved Maxton. She finally had the courage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Verena promised to tell him something upon her return, Isaac didn&#39;t press.</p>
