                <p>Danica listened and took a slow breath. &#34;I see. That explains it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s hand squeezed Danica&#39;s a little tighter as shespoke with clear intent. &#34;Mrs. Bennett, I really am the best option for Isaac&#39;s care. I hope you&#39;ll give this some serious thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The urgency in Katelyn&#39;s words wasn&#39;t lost on Danica. She weighed everything carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had already proven herself by curing Barrie, but as Katelyn pointed out, Isaac&#39;s case was far more complex. Even Verena herself admitted she couldn&#39;t guarantee success. Compared to that uncertainty,Katelyn&#39;s confidence and track record offered reaI reassurance. She even promised there was no chance of failure,reminding Danica that Evelyn had treated cases worse than Isaac&#39;s with complete success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That settled it for Danica. Isaac might resist, but for his own good, she would have to push him-no matter how much he disliked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking off her hesitation, Danica gave Katelyn&#39;s hand a gentle pat. &#34;You can leave this to me. I&#39;ll talk things over with Verena, and I promise, I&#39;ll make sure Isaac agrees to your treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of satisfaction flickered in Katelyn&#39;s expression as she smiled. &#34;Thank you. I&#39;Il let you handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica let out a sigh. &#34;Honestly, I should be the one thanking you. If you really can help Isaac, anything within my reach, just ask, and it&#39;s yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s reply was soft. &#34;Please, there&#39;s no need for that between us. Our families have always been close.Isaac&#39;s been a friend since we were children. Even if you never asked, I would do whatever I could to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica felt a wave of gratitude at her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They chatted for a few more minutes before Katelyn glanced up, as if something had just come to mind.&#34;Mrs. Bennett, I promised Professor Branson I&#39;d go over some research topics with him, so I should get going.&#34; She shot a look at Wendell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught her cue and rose. &#34;Yes, we already had plans to meet today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica stood with them. &#34;Of course. I won&#39;t keep you any longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Wendell with a warm but apologetic smile, she added, &#34;Professor Branson, I hope today&#39;s visit was comfortable. Forgive any lapses in my hospitality.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell felt even guiltier at her kindness, barely able to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head and forced a small smile. &#34;You were a wonderful host, Mrs. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the front gates of the mansion, Danica watched as they departed, the car pulling away and disappearing down the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car neared the intersection, the driver glanced back and asked, &#34;Miss Fuller, which way now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn answered smoothly, arms folded with ease, &#34;Drop Professor Branson off at his place first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious that bringing up academic discussions with Wendell had only been a pretext for her to slip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell shook his head, his thoughts drifting to his grandson waiting at home. &#34;No need. Just pull over at the next corner. I&#39;ll grab a taxi from there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Avoiding any needless interaction with Katelyn was his priority, and he had no desire to remain in the same space with someone he saw as insincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver paused for a moment, uncertain. &#34;But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile curved on Katelyn&#39;s lips as she said, &#34;Follow Professor Branson&#39;s instructions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; The driver nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car rolled to a gentle stop at the junction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn, still in a good mood, offered a parting word. &#34;Take care, Professor Branson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his hand on the door, Wendell paused. &#34;I&#39;ve said everything you wanted. Now it&#39;s your turn to honor your end of the bargain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing him directly, Katelyn spoke with quiet certainty. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. As long as you cooperate, your family won&#39;t be harmed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied with her answer, Wendell stepped out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waited on the curb, soon hailing a cab and disappearing from view. The moment he was gone, Katelyn&#39;s pleasant expression dropped. She turned to the driver. &#34;Get two people to watch Danica and Wendell. I want updates on everyone they meet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a respectful nod, the driver responded, &#34;I understand, Miss Fuller.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at Seraphina Villas...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the middle of conducting surgical experiments in the medical room, Verena looked up when Rhonda came in to inform her of Danica&#39;s arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she couldn&#39;t step away just yet, Verena responded, &#34;I understand. Keep her company for the time being.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a nod, Rhonda headed downstairs to speak with Danica. &#34;She&#39;s in the middle of a surgical experiment and isn&#39;t able to leave just yet. Please feel at home in the meantime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity sparked in Danica&#39;s voice as she asked, &#34;Does she perform surgical experiments every single day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda let out a soft laugh and nodded. &#34;She doesn&#39;t just do it once a day; she practically lives in the medical room, working nonstop to find a cure for Mr. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica paused, momentarily stunned by Rhonda&#39;s words. She had come with the intention of explaining her reasons to Verena face-to-face, yet now her emotions felt tangled and uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Verena&#39;s relentless dedication to curing Isaac sparked a quiet sense of gratitude, doubt still lingered beneath the surface. Determination alone wasn&#39;t enough to earn her trust, and she wasn&#39;t willing to risk Isaac&#39;s well-being on unproven medical expertise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up at the second floor, Danica let out a soft sigh, her words tinged with a gentle helplessness.&#34;She really is thoughtful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting in the living room, she felt a flutter of nerves as footsteps echoed down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena descended the stairswith a warm smile and said, &#34;Danica, I just wrapped up a surgical experiment and took a quick shower to get rid of the smell. I&#39;m sorry for making you wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica returned the smile, her eyes warm with concern. &#34;Rhonda told me you spend hours at a time in that medical room. You need to be careful; not even the busiest doctor should neglect their own health.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unexpected care from an elder caught Verena off guard. After a quick pause, she answered with a reassuring smile, &#34;I promise, I&#39;m fine. You don&#39;t need to worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica reached over and gave Verena&#39;s hand a gentle squeeze. &#34;You&#39;ve been on your feet all morning. Sit here and rest for a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a seat beside her, Verena suddenly glanced at the time and said, &#34;I&#39;ll have Rhonda prepare a few more dishes. Why don&#39;t you stay and join us for lunch?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena was about to call out to Rhonda, but Danica quickly stopped her. &#34;That&#39;s alright. I can&#39;t stay long today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer made Verena glance up in curiosity. &#34;Was there something you needed to talk to me about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of hesitation crossed Danica&#39;s face, but she remembered her conversation with Katelyn and pressed on. &#34;I want to talk about Isaac and his treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded, giving her full attention. &#34;Please, go on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a breath, Danica said, &#34;I&#39;ve found the most suitable doctor for lsaac. From now on, you won&#39;t have to worry about his care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s expression sharpened slightly. &#34;The most suitable doctor? Who are you talking about?&#34; Danica&#39;s excitement showed in her eyes. &#34;It&#39;s Katelyn. Verena, do you realize who she really is? She&#39;s Evelyn, the legendary medical genius everyone&#39;s been talking about, both here and abroad!&#34;</p>
