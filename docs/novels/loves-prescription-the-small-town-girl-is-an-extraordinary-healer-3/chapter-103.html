                <p>Both Slater and Bobby clearly thought the world of Verena, didn&#39;t they? Kaia seethed inwardly.Slater even went so far as to post on social media to mock her,just todefend Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia wondered how their faces would look when Verena&#39;s lie was exposed on her big day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she got home, Kaia wasted no time sharing her discovery with Alec and Laura. &#34;Dad, Mom, you&#39;ve both been fooled by Verena. She never graduated from Pine Hill University. I&#39;m telling the truth. I had it checked-her name doesn&#39;t exist in their records.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s eyeswidened in disbelief. &#34;Whatare yousaying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec, on the other hand, barely flinched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot Kaia a measured look, reading her intentions with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dismissive snort, Alec stood up from the couch.&#34;You really expect me to believe you just like that?Even if Verena lied about her education background,what difference does it make?&#34; He stepped closer,his words deliberate and heavy. &#34;I&#39;m telling you this, Kaia: I won&#39;t allow you to drag our family&#39;s reputation through the mud. There won&#39;t be any scenes at Verena&#39;s wedding. Try anything, and you&#39;ll answer to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his warning delivered, Alec turned away and headed upstairs without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The real reason Alec wasn&#39;t in a rush to look into Verena&#39;s education background was simple-she was his own child. If this got out, the Willis family&#39;s standing would take a hit, and so would his personal reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years spent building his public image couldn&#39;t be risked now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura, who had started to question further, caught sight of Alec&#39;s stern face and thought better of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Kaia&#39;s arm a gentle squeeze and murmured,&#34;Your father&#39;s under a lot of stress lately. Don&#39;t add to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then followed Alec up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone in the living room, Kaia stared after her parents as they disappeared from view. Her hands curled into fists, trembling from frustration. She held still for a moment, and then let out a laugh laced with sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, they were talking down to her like she hadn&#39;t heard it all before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since her name had been dragged through the mud online, Alec hadn&#39;t openly confronted her, but the cold shoulder was unmistakable. He kept his distance,barely even speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia knew he was biding his time, waiting for the club mess to quiet down before finally dealing with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All her effort to uncover Verena&#39;s secret had been a desperate attempt to win back their approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If nothing else, she wanted Alec and Laura to see she was not the one deceiving them-it was Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the only thing she received for her effort was a stern warning not to ruin her sister&#39;s wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cared so much about appearances that he&#39;d do anything to prevent Verena from being shamed in public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what about the humiliation she had suffered?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All those people from their social circle had shown up just to see her fail-had Alec ever once stepped in to defend her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why should she be expected to protect his dignity, or Verena&#39;s, when no one ever shielded hers?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Absolutely not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia made up her mind right then: she had no intention of following his orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They could have their turn on Verena&#39;s wedding day -let them feel the sting of embarrassment for once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That morning,Jacob arranged a meeting with the team from the wedding company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing a meeting at Bennett Group that afternoon, Isaac left for his appointment with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News that Isaac would be handling wedding details himself had the entire staff buzzing with anticipation;everyone waited out front, eager to make a good impression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek black limousine glided to a stop moments later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lined up in neat rows, the staff gave respectful bows as the manager hurried forward, anxious not to miss a beat. Once the vehicle was parked, Jacob assisted Isaac into his wheelchair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With practiced hospitality, the wedding company manager greeted Isaac warmly and escorted him into a private VIP suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the walls were filled with displays-photographs of famous weddings, wealthy couples,and global icons, all serving as inspiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac took a measured look around before letting his attention drift back to the task at hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t have to say a word-the manager picked up on his lack of enthusiasm for the wedding styles displayed around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brought over a stack of thick albums and set them down with a soft thud. &#34;These were put together by well-known designers from around the world, Mr.Bennett. You&#39;re welcome to flip through them, and if you&#39;ve got something else in mind, I&#39;d be happy to hear it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac turned a few pages, and then looked up and set the record straight. &#34;My opinion isn&#39;t the one that matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching on immediately, the manager replied, &#34;So,it&#39;s the bride&#39;s wishes we&#39;ll follow, correct?&#34; A faint light flickered in lsaac&#39;s eyes, and a subtle smile touched his lips. &#34;Exactly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few young employees nearby exchanged whispers,clearly smitten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, Mr. Bennett always seemed so distant, but he&#39;s actually so sweet to his wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I got married, my in-laws made every choice.I couldn&#39;t stand anything they planned. Hearing this just makes me jealous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If only I could meet someone like him...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager was quietly impressed-the Bennett Group CEO was actually a devoted husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maintaining her professionalism, she pressed on, her voice friendly. &#34;What sort of wedding does your bride envision? Does she have favorite flowers, or a particular style-maybe classic, rustic, or romantic?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac opened his mouth to answer, but the words never came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did it hit him-he had no idea what Verena actually liked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting the album aside, Isaac told the manager, &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll need to check with my wife before making  these choices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager blinked, caught off guard for a moment,but quickly composed herself. &#34;Of course, Mr.Bennett. Please take all the time you need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out his phone, lsaac found Verena&#39;s number and called her directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, several staff members nearby traded whispers, the mood shifting from admiration to skepticism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were holding a wedding ceremony, but the groom didn&#39;t know his bride&#39;s favorite things.How strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speculation buzzed through the room-maybe lsaac wasn&#39;t as devoted as he seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it just for show?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across town, at Seraphina Villas, Verena enjoyed a peaceful afternoon, tending to the plants with a rare lightness in her step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her phone vibrated, she wiped her hands,checked the screen, and grinned. She answered it and spoke cheerfully. &#34;Hey, honey! Worn out from work?Need your sweet wife to give you a boost?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t realize Isaac was nowhere near his office. The playful endearment made Isaac&#39;s heart skip, and he tightened his grip on the phone, clearing his throat before replying, &#34;I could use that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regaining focus, Isaac moved to his rea reason for calling. &#34;Can I ask-what&#39;s your favorite flower?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena arched a brow,half-expecting he was planning a surprise bouquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of the ring on her finger, she smiled to herself and answered,&#34;Roses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, so wrapped up in worrying about the ring&#39;s origin, hadn&#39;t even noticed the rose-shaped diamond on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued, &#34;What sort of style do you prefer for an event-romantic, classic, or maybe rustic?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena paused, surprised that picking flowers came with so many options.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stll, she answered honestly, &#34;Romantic, I think.&#34;</p>
