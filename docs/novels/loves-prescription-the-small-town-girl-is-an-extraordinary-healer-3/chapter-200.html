                <p>Katelyn had a backup plan. She had feared that if she killed Verena and the matter was ever pursued,fleeing abroad would be as useless as running in circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew her butler valued his son above all else, so she lured him with silver and promises, offering wealth and prosperity for his son&#39;s family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bargain was clear: if things went awry, the butler alone would shoulder the blame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Temptation often blinds judgment, and the butler accepted without much hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, it was the butler who had mostly dealt with Elmore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As far as Katelyn was concerned, she had clean hands-no thread for the police to unravel. Watching her desperate attempt to escape punishment, Verena narrowed her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw plainly that Katelyn was not strong but merely drowning in her own failure, hiding despair and fear behind a mask of frenzy and feigned bravado.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena did not let her savor those delusions. She pierced the bubble without mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You imagine Kaia would still rush to your rescue now? She isn&#39;t like you, hardened by deceit. She&#39;s naive, yes-but not so blind as to stain her hands with crime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lips curved in a wry smile. &#34;You say you came to save me? That&#39;s laughable. Do you think everyone is witless, unable to guard evidence? Kaia recorded every word of your dealings with her. And your butler-the one you believed would gallantly take the fall-I already hold proof of your transactions and your scheme of hiring hitmen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if recalling something, Verena cast her gaze around the factory. &#34;Ah, I nearly forgot. From the moment you stepped inside, every word, every move was caught on camera. You can neither flee nor wash your name clean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile touched her face as she added slowly,&#34;But take comfort-though you wished for my death,I won&#39;t grant you the mercy of dying. Death would free you too easily. Instead, you&#39;ll waste away in prison until the end of your days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mocking gaze fell upon Katelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From Verena&#39;s eyes, Katelyn read nothing but contempt and cold superiority, as though she were a mere insect pinned beneath glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No...no...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn shook her head violently, whispering like someone possessed, &#34;This can&#39;t be, I won&#39;t lose...I won&#39;t lose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest rose and fell in ragged waves as she staggered backward. She clawed at her hair with both hands, desperate to wake from what felt like a nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the tearing pain on her scalp drove home the cruel truth-this nightmare was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization cracked her completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bent low, cursing under her breath, and then broke into a wild, jagged laugh, her figure trembling like a puppet on broken strings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abruptly, the laughter cut off. She jerked her head up, eyes blazing at Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those bloodshot eyes seemed on the verge of bursting, her features twisted like a demon&#39;s mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, do you think this will make me bow my head?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her rasping voice echoed through the vast factory,chilling the air itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze darted to the knife glinting on the floor, anda deranged smile tugged at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As long as you&#39;re dead, I haven&#39;t lost!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lunged down, snatched the knife, and clutched it in her left hand, raising it high to drive it into Verena&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the police were quicker than her madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang-bang-bang!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gunfire cracked through the factory, deafening and absolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three bullets tore into her arm and shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Agony ripped through her, and the knife flew from her grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The searing pain spread like lightning, blood gushing down her arm, dyeing her white coat into a grotesque red shroud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her vision wavered, legs faltering beneath her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy thud, she collapsed unconscious onto the floor.</p>
