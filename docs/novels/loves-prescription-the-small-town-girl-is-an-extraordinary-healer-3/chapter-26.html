                <p>Alec leaned forward slightly and asked, &#34;What kind of achievements has Evelyn made in medicine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s eyes lit up at her father&#39;s interest, and she answered with enthusiasm, &#34;Evelyn&#39;s incredible, Dad!A few years back, in Clokron, they led a groundbreaking heart transplant that shook the entire medical community. That operation alone made Evelyn famous, and since then, many of Evelyn&#39;s successful high-risk operations have been written into medical textbooks. Every medical student looks up to that legendary doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of Evelyn made Alec thoughtful.Years of dealing with society&#39;s elite had taught him how much they valued their health. Forming a connection with someone like Evelyn could open doors in ways money and power couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought in mind, Alec rested a hand on Kaia&#39;s shoulder and instructed, &#34;When the lecture is over, make sure you get Evelyn&#39;s contact information.Don&#39;t let a chance like this pass you by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even without his reminder, Kaia had already resolved to do just that. To her, Evelyn wasn&#39;t only a famous doctor-they were her greatest inspiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a cheerful nod and said with a smile, &#34;You don&#39;t need to worry, Dad. I&#39;ll definitely take the opportunity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock ran through Bobby when he learned Isaac and Verena&#39;s wedding date had already been set. He had assumed there was still time to derail what he considered a mismatched marriage, but his mother and the Willis family had moved faster than expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he didn&#39;t act quickly, Verena, the girl he believed to be deceptive, would officially become part of the Bennett family. He was determined to see her in person and decide for himself what sort of woman she truly was. In his mind, she couldn&#39;t possibly be beyond his ability to control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acting on imnpulse, Bobby hurried into his room,grabbed his phone, and dialed Kaia&#39;s number. Though he had never thought much of her, she was his only link to Verena in this urgent moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call connected not long after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It struck Bobby that they hadn&#39;t spoken once since the last birthday party. When Bobby&#39;s call lit up Kaia&#39;s phone, the memory of being left hanging at her birthday party rushed back,souring her mood. Still, his decision to reach out stirred a faint hope that he might finally be giving her some thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s voice was soft as she asked, &#34;Mr.Bennett,what can I do for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of polite chatter, Bobby got straight to the point. &#34;I want to meet Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit Kaia like a shock. Her face stiffened,and after a stunned pause, she stammered, &#34;Wha... what did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea sounded so unbelievable that she questioned whether she had heard him correctly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby repeated himself without hesitation, &#34;Let Verena know | expect to see her tomorrow. If not,just pass along my number.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia struggled to understand what she had just heard.What reason could Bobby possibly have for wanting to meet Verena? No matter what drew people near her or what their intentions were, they always seemed to be asking about Verena in the end. It had happened with Cayden before, and now it was happening again with Bobby. Forcing herself to keep calm, she asked in a tentative tone, &#34;Why exactly do you want to meet Verena, Mr.Bennett?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows drew together in irritation. &#34;I don&#39;t owe you an explanation. Just give her the message.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s mind raced. The last thing she wanted was for Bobby to see Verena, especially since she had once sent a message in the group chat, hinting that Verena wasn&#39;t attractive, and everyone had believed her. If he saw Verena in person, that lie would unravel instantly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a shame,&#34; said Kaia flatly, spinning the lie without a hint of emotion. &#34;Verena hasn&#39;t been around much lately, and even I barely run into her. She keeps to herself most of the time. Our family hardly speaks with her, so I doubt she&#39;d be open to someone she doesn&#39;t know. I don&#39;t have any way to reach her,either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Kaia spoke made Verena seem cold and full of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doubt crept into Bobby&#39;s mind as he listened to KCaia.He figured Verena might be distant, but it seemed unlikely that Kaia didn&#39;t have a chance to speak with her sister at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than press the issue, Bobby picked up on Kaia&#39;s unwillingness to help and decided not to question her motives any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby&#39;s voice was flat. &#34;Alright, if you&#39;re not interested in helping, I&#39;ll just handle it on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all he said before he ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she heard his words, Kaia felt panic rising in her chest. Someone like Bobby, with his influence,wouldn&#39;t struggle for long if he set his mind on finding Verena. The chance of them meeting seemed impossible to avoid. If Bobby ever saw Verena and thought she was beautiful, he might stop objecting to the marriage with Isaac altogether.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As these thoughts spun in her head,Kaia&#39;s anxiety only grew. Even though her feelings for lsaac had faded after his accident, she hated the idea of Verena ending up with the man she once wanted but could never have. The thought alone was unbearable, and she simply couldn&#39;t allow it to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry twisted Kaia&#39;s expression as she gnawed at her lip and tried to come up with a way to keep Bobby and Verena apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Kaia&#39;s eyes landed on the steaming bowl of soup a maid had just brought to the bedside table, and an idea sparked in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Bobby had never met Verena, he wouldn&#39;t recognize her. If something happened to ruin Verena&#39;s appearance before their meeting,Bobby would surely turn away in disgust and refuse to accept her as a future sister-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image of a scarred Verena flashed through Kaia&#39;s mind, and she burst out laughing at the thought</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena finished washing up and headed downstairs,making her way to the dining room for breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia had already been lingering in the kitchen for more than thirty minutes, waiting for just the right moment. She scooped up a bowl of steaming soup with extra care when she heard footsteps approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Verena took her seat at the table, Kaia moved slowly toward her, balancing the bowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena took a small bite of the bread the maid had handed her and noticed a flash of pink in her peripheral vision. That shade of pajama belonged to Kaia alone, making it clear who had been lingering in the kitchen the entire time. She wondered what ridiculous scheme Kaia might be brewing now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One eyebrow lifted, Verena kept a close watch on Kaia without turning her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Kaia tripped and came stumbling in Verena&#39;s direction. In a split second, Verena set her bread aside and sprang out of her chair to avoid the collision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her quick move made the chair scrape loudly against the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia was so startled by the sudden noise that she backed away, completely forgetting the bowl she was holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hot soup sloshed over the rim, burning her hand and making her cry out as she dropped the bowl. Some of it even splashed up onto her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears filled Kaia&#39;s eyes while she clutched her burned hand,blaming Verena for startling her on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Verena an angry glare, clearly about to start yelling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could speak, Verena interjected coldly,&#34;Not a great feeling, is it, Kaia? Burns pretty badly when your own scheme turns against you.&#34;</p>
