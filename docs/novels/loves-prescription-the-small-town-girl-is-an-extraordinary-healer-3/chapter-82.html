                <p>After everything was made clear, Bobby and Verena ate their breakfast in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Bobby still carried a trace of awkwardness and shame, sharing a private breakfast with his flawless sister-in-law felt like standing face-to-face with a childhood idol. Naturally, he was thrilled. Once he returned, he would surely brag about this encounter to Slater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When breakfast was done, they went their separate ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena returned to the hotel, while Bobby drove back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he stepped into the living room, Bobby caught sight of Isaac sitting squarely on the sofa,positioned directly toward the entrance, as though he had been waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of surprise darted through Bobby&#39;s mind. At this hour, Isaac was usually buried in work at the company-why was he still at home?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Bobby could open his mouth to greet him, Isaac spoke first. &#34;You&#39;re back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby&#39;s lips parted but froze midway, as though strung with silent questions. Had he heard correctly? Isaac showing concern for him? That was something new. Isaac had never cared about his comings andgoings.Even if he stumbled home at dawn after a wild night, Isaac never uttered a word. So why now...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby shifted uneasily, stealing a glance outside as if expecting the skies themselves to signal an unusual omen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping out of it, he asked carefully, &#34;Isaac, did you need something from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze lingered briefly on Bobby&#39;s overly formal suit, and then slid away. Without answering directly,he gestured at the seat beside him. &#34;Sit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bewildered, Bobby obeyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lifted a cup of coffee from the table, his fingers curving in a deliberate grace. He blew across the Fun Merge surface, took a sip, and lowered his eyes. The rising steam blurred his vision, pricking faintly at his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Isaac asked in a voice that seemed calm, almost casual, &#34;Haven&#39;t seen you at the company lately. Something troubling you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike Isaac&#39;s steady tone, Bobby&#39;s heart lurched. Troubling him? If Isaac ever discovered that each missed day at the office was spent dealing with his fiancée, Bobby&#39;s life would not be worth a dime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wanting no part in that danger, Bobby shook his head with all the force he could muster. &#34;No, no, no,nothing at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dared not even entertain such thoughts anymore-better to bury them where they belonged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac rested his fingers on the table&#39;s edge, tapping lightly. Each hollow thud sounded like a slow drumbeat.His gaze lifted, calm but probing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Out so early today. Where did you go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby felt another chill crawl down his spine. What kind of perilous question was this? Why was Isaac cornering him with words that felt like a knife&#39;s edge between life and death?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of the harsh remarks he had once made about Verena, Bobby dared not confess he had just met her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scratching his head, his face flushed crimson, he stammered, &#34;Just... personal matters. Isaac, please don&#39;t ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Isaac pressed further, Bobby would have no courage leftto face either him or Verena. After all, hadn&#39;t he once warned that if Isaac truly married Verena, he would regret it? And yet-ironically-the one regretting now was him. Wasn&#39;t this like swallowing his own pride wwhole?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby&#39;s halting reply was a far cry from his usual lighthearted manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s tapping ceased. He studied Bobby&#39;s awkwardness-the reddened face, the restless hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew Bobby&#39;s character too well, as his brother had stuck close to him since childhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this expression-lsaac had seen it once before, when Bobby first entered high school and secretly admired a girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The resemblance now was uncanny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Isaac remembered Bobby&#39;s strong opposition to his relationship with Verena. And considering his own condition now...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s Adam&#39;s apple shifted as he clasped his hands on his lap, his voice turning grave. &#34;Bobby, I&#39;ve always told you: the things you should not do, never do; the thoughts you should not harbor, never let them take root; and the desires you cannot force, never force. Before you act, you should consider whether your action will wound others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The abrupt weight in his tone left Bobby startled. But he quickly concluded Isaac was simply scolding him for his past recklessness. With a forced cheer, he nodded. &#34;I understand. I&#39;l remember your words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s brows drew together slightly as he searched Bobby&#39;s eyes, as though confirming his sincerity. After a long moment, he looked away, expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence thickened across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby admired Isaac more than anyone, yet feared him more than anyone too-especially when he wore that calm,impenetrable mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stillness pressed in, leaving Bobby restless beneath its weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning ease, he rose to his feet. &#34;Isaac, if there&#39;s nothing else, I&#39;ll head to my room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he watched his brother&#39;s retreating figure ascend the stairs, Isaac narrowed his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, his cold voice drifted through the room. &#34;Andres, prepare the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast with Bobby, Verena returned to the hotel and immersed herself in her work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was carefully sorting through her materials when the doorbell rang. A flicker of curiosity flashed in her eyes. Not long ago, she would have immediately thought it was isaac. Butever since Laura&#39;s uninvited appearance, she could not be sure whether the visitor was friend or foe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marking her place on the document, she rose to open the door</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant the door swung open, a firm hand seized her wrist, and before she could draw breath, she waspulled into lsaac&#39;s lap,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled yet delighted, Verena gasped, &#34;What are you-mph!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were swallowed by the cool press of his lips</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He guided her hand to his shoulder, circling her waist with one arm, while his other hand skillfully turned the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wheelchair into the room and shut the door with finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire movement flowed with unbroken rhythm, not a beat wasted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though startled at first, Verena quickly melted into his embrace, her arms winding around his neck as shereturned his kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was urgent, yet tender, stirring a hunger that grew the more she yielded</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lt was less a kiss than a search for solace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking down from where she sat, Verena saw him gazing upward, lips pressed with unwavering devotion.lsaac parted her lips, gently catching her tongue between his teeth, drawing from her a shiver and a faintwhimper before he let go</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was warm with the hotel&#39;s heating, and Verena, having come in from outside, wore only a light outfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking from her lips, saac lowered his head, his nose brushing against her collarbone and bare shoulderHer slender frame and loose clothing made her seem even more delicate, as though one careless breathmight shatter her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed a kiss to her shoulder, and then stiled-calming himself as though resisting the pull of impulse</p>
