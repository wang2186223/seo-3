                <p>Gavin&#39;s eyes followed Verena&#39;s fading silhouette, his mind reeling. Was she truly walking away without another word?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs,the second floor held rows of private rooms,usually reserved for the wealthy and influential to hold their serious negotiations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she climbed the stairs, Verena moved down the long corridor until her eyes landed on Isaac&#39;s assistant posted outside a door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sight confirmed it-Isaac was definitely inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she quickened her steps toward the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plush carpet absorbed the sharp click of her heels,rendering her footsteps nearly noiseless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not until Verena stood right at the doorway did the assistant finally notice her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, he nodded in respect. &#34;Miss Willis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, he politely asked, &#34;What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offering only a small nod, Verena ignored his question and shifted her gaze toward the closed door. &#34;Is Isaac inside?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He confirmed with a nod. &#34;Yes, Mr. Bennett is currently discussing a business deal with a partner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he added cautiously, &#34;Would you like me to let him know you&#39;re here?&#34; | Choose scandal reporter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she added, &#34;Go ahead and enjoy your food,then head home. Don&#39;t wait around for me.Think of this meal as my treat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost at once, a simple OK emoji popped up on her screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding her phone into her handbag, Verena patiently waited for the meeting inside to end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within the private room, the business associate checked his watch and realized their discussion had stretched close to four hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere around lsaac carried such an oppressive weight that every passing minute felt longer than it was. At first, the negotiations had gone smoothly, but once Isaac stepped outside for a phone call and returned with a storm locked behind his eyes,the atmosphere never lifted. His reputation for being aloof and commanding suddenly felt understated-the pressure in the room bordered on suffocating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, after offering one compromise after another,the man saw lsaac give a faint nod of approval. His endless persuasion throughout the afternoon had finally paid off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising to his feet, the partner reached out for a handshake,which lsaac accepted with cold composure before responding evenly, &#34;You may go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking the cue, the partner smiled politely. &#34;In that case, I&#39;ll take my leave, Mr. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence reclaimed the room, yet lsaac&#39;s mind refused to quiet. He kept replaying the image of Verena adjusting that man&#39;s tie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ties and belts-those were touches reserved for someone close, someone trusted. Even though Verena had clarified in the message that the man was a friend, and he warned himself not to read too much into it, the thought gnawed at him all the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his head bowed, Isaac&#39;s eyes lingered on his useless legs, a shadow of ridicule flickering within. The man she had been with earlier was whole, strong,walking freely-everything Isaac no longer was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Isaac sank deeper into his thoughts, the quiet creak of the door breaking open drew his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Believing it must be his assistant, Isaac didn&#39;t bother to look up, murmuring in a subdued tone, &#34;Give me a little time alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of the expected polite reply, a warm, melodic voice chimed in, &#34;So even I&#39;m not allowed to enter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That gentle tone carried both lightness and ease. A jolt ran through his spine, and a dull ache pressed at his temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising his head abruptly, he found Verena only a short distance away, her head slightly tilted as a playful smile curved her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How...&#34; His voice caught, the word slipping out in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment it felt unreal, and he blinked to steady himself,half afraid she would vanish if he looked away.&#34;How did you even know I was here?&#34; he asked at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,&#34; Verena replied. Her eyes gleamed with mischief as she borrowed the very line he had once used while pursuing her. &#34;Maybe I just felt it. You were thinking of me, weren&#39;t you? So of course I came.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her playful words slipped out as naturally as breathing,yet each one stirred his chest like pebbles tossed into still water, unsettling his guarded calm. His jaw clenched,and an unfamiliar warmth rose to his cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34; The denial hovered on his tongue, yet he knew uttering it would betray the truth that she had indeed occupied his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac didn&#39;t seem to remember this playful line he had once used, Verena felt no real disappointment,for she had prepared herself for this ever since his treatment began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, I&#39;ll stop teasing you.&#34; Watching his silence stretch on, Verena&#39;s face brightened as she explained,&#34;I actually came to clarify things. The man downstairs is both my assistant and my friend. He arrived back from overseas today, so I collected him from the airport, and we shared a meal together. And besides that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a knowing smile, she looked directly at Isaac and added, &#34;He returned because of the woman he loves.So please don&#39;t misread the situation, or else he might refuse to come to our wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac realized Verena had sought him out just to clear things up, it was as if fireworks burst inside his chest, chasing away every shadow of doubt. The weight pressing on him disappeared, leaving behind a joy so fierce he struggled to contain it. Yet with her sincere gaze on him,he found himself unable to show that happiness openly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallowed hard and turned his head to the side,holding firm as he murmured, &#34;I didn&#39;t misunderstand anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t-he simply couldn&#39;t let his emotions slip through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Verena arched a brow at his awkward and then chose to humor him with a soft reply.&#34;That&#39;s fine then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quiet settled over the room, and once more Isaac let his eyes fall to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hush was broken by the sound of light footsteps steadily nearing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he even raised his head, gleaming silver stilettos came into view against the ornate red carpet beneath him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena halted before him, lowered herself to her knees, and guided his hand to her cheek with gentle intention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter if you misunderstood or not,&#34; she whispered. &#34;I explained because I want you to understand that no matter how impressive someone else might seem, they mean nothing to me. You are the only one I choose, and I couldn&#39;t bear the thought of you being hurt by jealousy or sorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The softness in her voice carried the patience of someone calming a sorrowful child, and at times her cheek brushed lightly against his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Isaac, it felt as though she was shattering every unspoken boundary, for who could lace such tender sweetness into words spoken with such innocence? A lump rose in his throat, and faint moisture shimmered in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again and again his lips moved without sound, and at last all he managed was a faint nod in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the look in his eyes, Verena understood that every word she had spoken had settled deep within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon arriving back at the Willis Villa, Verena slid her car into the garage, and the moment she entered the living room, Kaia&#39;s voice rang out to meet her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m honestly amazed. Who would&#39;ve thought my dear sister kept such surprising talents tucked away?&#34;Kaia remarked, letting every word drip with sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Experience told Verena that whenever Kaia came looking for her, trouble usually followed. Wanting no part of it today, she moved to pass by, but Kaia stretched out her arm to block the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena turned toward Kaia,her brow pulling tight</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing wasn&#39;t something Kaia ever liked to own up to,least of all when Verena was watching</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting Verena&#39;s steady stare, Kaia responded with a frown of her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia had no idea that her baby-faced looks didn&#39;t carry the weight that Verena&#39;s calm,sculpted features did, and the fierce look she tried to pull off ended up looking more silly than serious.</p>
