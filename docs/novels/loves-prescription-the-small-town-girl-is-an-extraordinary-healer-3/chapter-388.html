                <p>Rowland moistened his parched lips, cleared his throat,and spoke with a hint of foreboding. &#34;Mr. Sampson,unless fate takes an unexpected turn, trouble is about to knock at our door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh?&#34; Luis paused mid-flip through his files,his brow furrowing in doubt. &#34;And what kind of trouble would that be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Darrell,&#34; Rowland stepped forward boldly, his voice dropping to a hushed urgency. &#34;Last night...I caught him red-handed. He was using that stuff-the contraband! I saw it myself, sealed in tiny plastic bags.He was sneaking about with someone-looked very much like a deal in the making...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darrell Sugden had been Luis&#39; handpicked man to oversee the entire network of underground clubs in Ochrerayd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis had entrusted him with enormous authority, a domain stretching from polished private lounges to the darkest gambling dens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the years, Darrell had managed the underworld with meticulous care, sending Luis a steady  stream of staggering profits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was this very success that secured Darrell&#39;s seat at the heart of the organization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Rowland could finish, Luis&#39; palm struck the desk like a hammer, sending the pen springing half a foot into the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you just say? How many times have I told you all-keep your hands off that poison! Do my warnings echo into a void?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis shot to his feet, his eyes flashing like drawn steel,his presence weighing heavily on the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled by his fury, Rowland staggered a step back,his shoulders hunching instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many years has Darrell commanded Ochrerayd&#39;s underworld affairs? And now this? As if my words were mere whispers in the wind!&#34; Luis&#39; voice dripped witha frost so cold it froze the air. &#34;Tell me, how can I keep my standing in the underworld with this mockery hanging over me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snatching a porcelain ornament from the desk, he hurled it with force against the wall. It shattered in a sharp crash, fragments scattering like icy snow and leaving a veil of dust settling over the carpet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rowland trembled at the violent outburst, his knees  quivering beneath his trousers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fought down his fear, his Adam&#39;s apple rising and falling as he forced a shaky smile. &#34;Mr. Sampson, I know your anger is justified...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Luis whirled.on him before he could go on,his stare sharp as an eagle&#39;s beak, cutting the air between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rowland&#39;s throat tightened. He swallowed hard, and then pressed on with caution. &#34;But the real danger lies ahead. If Darrell&#39;s case isn&#39;t dealt with, others may take courage from it and follow the same path.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He deliberately softened his voice, trying to sound earnest as he bent to gather the broken shards,stealing a glance at Luis&#39; clenched jaw while doing SO.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rowland had seldom uttered a falsehood in his life,yet here he stood, lying to one of the most intimidating men he knew. His heart thundered in his chest,his hands trembling so much that they betrayed the anxiety he worked hard to conceal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave it,&#34; Luis said slowly, his tone firm as stone.&#34;Someone else will see to the cleaning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rowland quickly set the fragments aside, straightened up, and answered with respectful haste, &#34;Yes, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis lowered himself back into his chair, his icy gaze  sweeping over Rowland&#39;s taut expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rowland.&#34; His voice dropped to a deliberate calm.&#34;I&#39;ll ask you once more-are you absolutely certain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question, though mild in tone, struck Rowland&#39;s ears like thunder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenched his teeth, his nails digging into his palms,and forced himself to meet Luis&#39; gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he saw those eyes that seemed to strip away every pretense, a flicker of panic crossed his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With sheer will, he smothered the fear,lifted his head abruptly, and declared with strained conviction, &#34;Mr.Sampson, I swear it on my very life. Darrell carries a gun at his back, and the crates are filled with those contraband goods-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice broke, and he slammed his left hand on the desk. &#34;If I&#39;m lying, take this hand as the price!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his words rang with trembling intensity and his legs shook beneath him, Rowland forced himself to stand steady, determined not to let his fear betray him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his vow fell into the air, silence swallowed the office whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rowland&#39;s unease grew unbearable-his Adam&#39;s apple  bobbed visibly, cold sweat trickling down his neck and seeping into his collar, spreading into a dark stain at his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every heartbeat of Luis&#39; silence was like the blade of a guillotine dangling above his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, just as Rowland was about to collapse under the weight of it, Luis suddenly threw back his head and laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rowland blinked in confusion, caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis lifted a handkerchief and calmly wiped the photo frame beside him. &#34;Rowland, you&#39;ve done well.Few dare keep such a watchful eye on Darrell. I&#39;ll remember this courage of yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his gaze, concealing the flicker in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rowland, hearing this reprieve and sensing no mnore suspicion from Luis, loosened his stiff back and exhaled heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening his posture, he stretched a sycophantic smile across his face. In a tone thick with devotion,he said, &#34;Mr. Sampson, I never forget whom I serve. No matter how fearsome Darrell may seem, I&#39;ll face him head-on. Whatever danger lies ahead, I&#39;ll bear it for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis kept polishing the frame, his gaze fixed downward. Rowland&#39;s fervent oaths rang through the office, yet in Luis&#39; heart, a quiet, mocking sneer had already taken root.</p>
