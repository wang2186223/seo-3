                <p>Verena was striking, polished, and talented-no wonder people held her in such esteem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Isaac, though he cloaked it well, felt a flicker of envy stirring in his chest, a shadow he dared not show Barrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the urgency in Barrie&#39;s tone, Isaac knew the old man&#39;s concern was fixed on Verena. HHe kept his own voice calm, carrying warmth. &#34;Barrie, don&#39;t trouble yourself. Verena is my wife. No one knows her heart better than I do, and I trust her completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That quiet certainty in Isaac&#39;s words drew out Barrie&#39;s hearty laugh on the other end. &#34;Good, good! Trust is the foundation of everything. That&#39;s what most young couples today are missing. I&#39;m glad you can trust Dr.Willis. Boy, it seems her care and effort on you have not been in vain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Verena was tending to Isaac, Barrie gently shifted the subject toward Isaac&#39;s health. After a pause,he asked with caution, &#34;Isaac, under Verena&#39;s care,have your legs shown any improvement? Is there still a chance you&#39;ll stand tall again?&#34; Barrie had unwavering faith in Verena&#39;s skill. With her personally attending to lsaac, progress should have been only natural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his question was deliberate-it carried a reminder that Verena&#39;s gift as a physician was not to be underestimated or dismissed lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, lsaac&#39;s lips pressed together, and silence fell between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze dropped, lingering on the area between his unmoving legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world at large believed he was merely paralyzed.What they never knew was that the accident had robbed him of far more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sensed that Barrie wasn&#39;t only asking about Verena&#39;s treatment. The old man was also warning him not to mistreat her on the strength of idle rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Isaac admitted no progress to his legs, it would only deepen Barrie&#39;s worry about Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long stretch of silence, Isaac finally spoke,his tone low but steady. &#34;Our families have always been close,Barrie.I know you won&#39;t let this slip beyond us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion crept into Barrie&#39;s voice. &#34;Isaac, what do you mean by that?&#34; Drawing a slow breath, Isaac confessed, &#34;To be honest, that accident didn&#39;t only cripple my legs. It left me with some issues in the private part.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Man to man, Barrie caught his meaning at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw slackened, eyes widening with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never imagined fate would strike lsaac with such merciless cruelty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh left Barrie, but Isaac did not sink into self-pity.Instead, a faint smile curved his lips, his words almost breezy. &#34;But with Verena&#39;s treatment, those problems have been completely resolved. She also said that once she&#39;s back, she&#39;ll arrange surgery for my legs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned at first, Barrie soon erupted into delighted laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course-this was Dr. Willis. She could mend even what seemed impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And since Isaac was her husband, if she promised a surgery, then surely she already held confidence in its success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrie&#39;s voice brimmed with excitement. &#34;She&#39;s brilliant-simply brilliant! | always believed there was no illness beyond her grasp. Isaac, you&#39;d better cherish her. If you let her endure even the slightest wrong,I&#39;ll be the first torise against you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had it not been for his own useless grandson, Barrie would long ago have wished for Verena to enter his family as a granddaughter-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to Barrie heap praise upon Verena, Isaac&#39;s chest swelled with pride and quiet relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He replied, a soft smile tugging at the corners of his mouth, &#34;Yes. The greatest blessing of my life was marrying her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Bobby-having spent hours sparring online with those wealthy young people-slumped across the sofa,utterly drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance gnawed at him. Running a hand through his hair, he scrolled through the earlierchatter in the chat group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One wrote, &#34;Not to belittle country folk,but let&#39;s be real-Verena never mastered proper etiquette.Honestly, her having an affair with some older man fits her perfectly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby shot back at once. &#34;Nonsense! Verena is the most refined woman I&#39;ve ever known!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another reply came swiftly. &#34;Bobby, we get it-she&#39;s  your kin. But defending your family with such obvious lies? That doesn&#39;t help your case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reading that, Bobby nearly burst with rage again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did they mean by &#34;defending his family with such obvious lies&#34;?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t covering anything-he was telling the plain truth!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s utter rubbish!&#34; he fired back. &#34;She&#39;s my family.If I don&#39;t defend her, who should I defend-you? Keep slandering her and I&#39;ll see to it your family&#39;s business crumbles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury burned in him, his temples throbbing. But no matter how fiercely he argued, fresh chat groups sprang up, tossing mud at Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could keep throwing counterblows, but he couldn&#39;t guard every gate all day and night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of options, he punched in Verena&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bobby, what is it?&#34; Verena&#39;s voice was gentle, flowing through the receiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half his anger melted away at once. Worried she might misunderstand, he rushed to say,&#34;Verena, first of all, I trust you. Don&#39;t ever think otherwise!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His nerves tangled his words, and Verena let out a light chuckle. &#34;Then what&#39;s troubling you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Bobby released his pent-up fury. &#34;That foreign news story about you-Kaia&#39;s been spreading it everywhere. No one cares about truth; they just keep slandering you. I&#39;ve been fighting back, but no one believes me. I know you&#39;d never do such a thing. Tell me the truth yourself, so I can defend you properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice rose in passion, as though injustice itself was strangling him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she heard his fierce defense, Verena&#39;s nose stung with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since her grandmother&#39;s death, no one from her family had shielded her so steadfastly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of warmth flooded her heart, sharp and overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blinking back the swell of feeling, she answered gently, &#34;Bobby, thank you for standing by me. But you don&#39;t need to quarrel with them. Whatever you say,they won&#39;t believe it. Coming from the Bennett family,it will only seem like you&#39;re protecting your own. As for the truth, let me tell you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused before continuing, &#34;I went abroad to treat Maxton Fairclough. But his younger son, Erick, didn&#39;t want him to recover. To lower Erick&#39;s guard, Tobin and I agreed that I would appear publicly as his girlfriend.That&#39;s why the foreign press ran that piece. The whole point was to deceive Erick. Don&#39;t worry, though.Everyone in business circles already knows Maxton&#39;s been in a coma. The surest way to crush the rumor is for him to wake up and, with Tobin&#39;s help,set the record straight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maxton Fairclough?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby blinked, astonished. &#34;You mean Maxton of Smoothdeed Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded. &#34;That&#39;s righnt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby let out a low whistle. Of course he knew Maxton&#39;s legend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But something else shook him even more. &#34;So you went abroad to treat him! Has he recovered?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A calm smile curved Verena&#39;s lips. &#34;The surgery succeeded. He should wake soon. After a few more days of rest, he&#39;ll stand with Tobin to set things right.&#34;</p>
