                <p>At the Bennett home, the warm scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted through the air as Danica lounged on the sofa,chatting casually with Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena is pretty,&#34; Danica said, pouring the coffee with practiced ease. &#34;Still, growing up without her parents around and never getting a proper education leaves its mark.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica had never cared much about a person&#39;s bank account, yet schooling was another matter entirely.The Bennett family held one of the highest standings in Shoildon, and while Verena&#39;s family history didn&#39;t trouble her, the gap in education could invite friction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought back to the dinner at the restaurant, where Verena had claimed she was a Pine Hill University graduate.That memory brought a faint crease to her brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe she dressed up the truth a little,&#34; Danica added with a faint shrug. &#34;No matter. Once she&#39;s married in, we can smooth things out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slid a cup toward Isaac, who accepted it and let it rest on his lap without taking a sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She told the truth,&#34; he said, his deep voice breaking the quiet between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coffee pot halted midair before Danica set it down. &#34;What are you talking about? And how are you so sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t bother with an immediate reply. His eyes lingered on a droplet clinging to the rim of his cup,watching it tremble before sliding down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories from earlier flashed in his mind, the way Verena had knelt slightly to meet his gaze, her slim hand resting lightly on his useless legs, her voice steady as she said, &#34;I want to help you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time he had ever seen her, a complete stranger until now. Still, there was something quietly steady about her that drew him in and made her seem trustworthy.The honesty in her gaze and the sincerity in the way she carried herself left little room for doubt. When she said she graduated from Pine Hill University, it felt impossible to question her. Lying just didn&#39;t seem like something she&#39;d do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from him, Danica noticed his distant expression. It struck her that Verena had spoken to him in private earlier. Maybe something she had told him made him believe her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica wasn&#39;t surprised by his sudden silence. Since the accident, Isaac had become the kind of man who measured his words, speaking only when necessary before letting the conversation dissolve into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to speak, but the words slipped away before they could form, leaving her with nothing but a sigh.At this point, whether Verena had told the truth or not no longer seemed to matter. Once the girl became part of the family, she would be shaped into the kind of daughter-in-law they expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Skepticism came naturally to Danica when she thought about Verena&#39;s claim. The moment she mentioned graduating from Pine Hill University, Laura&#39;s startled reaction had been impossiblé to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given Laura&#39;s love of flauntingany scrap of prestige, a daughter with that kind of degree would have been paraded in front of everyone long ago. The idea that she could have allowed such an outstanding daughter to stay in the backward place was laughable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What puzzled Danica more was how Verena had managed to sway Isaac, a man far too sharp to be easily fooled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night settled in as Verena lay in bed, her gaze fixed on Isaac&#39;s name in her contacts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impulse overrode hesitation, and she tapped into the chat, typing out a quick message. &#34;Are you home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac read the text, brows drawing together, and then sent back a single word.&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small, knowing smile tugged at Verena&#39;s lips. There had been a time when he filled their chats with long,eager lines instead of clipped answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her profile photo sat as a blank white square, while his was a stark black. Vith most men, that kind of short reply could pass for arrogance or a sign they wanted the conversation ver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ut Isaac wasn&#39;t most men. This was simply who he was, reserved with anyone who didn&#39;t matter to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>is nature was no mystery to Verena. She had always known him that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>e asked without hesitation, &#34;Could you send me your medical records?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>le request made Isaac&#39;s grip on his phone tighten slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>e Bennett family had turned to some of the most respected doctors in the field, yet none had succeeded estoring his ability to walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hough his hope had never completely died, the constant string of disappointments had worn him thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>eyes dropped to the blanket draped over his legs, and a crease formed between his brows. Was it worth ing the heartbreak again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ore he could decide, the phone buzzed in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>short words lit up the screen. &#34;Trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ething in those words settled into his chest like a quiet ember, giving off a warmth he hadn&#39;t felt in a time. Could she really help him stand again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>brushed the edae of the armrest as a thought formed. After so many failed attempts, maybe one The quiet gave Verena space to think. Staring at the ceiling, she let old memories creep in before sending another message. &#34;Do you really not remember me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, she had almost been ready to say yes to him, but life had pulled them in different directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac paused at the question, and his mind wandered back to their private conversation at Spice Restaurant,when she had also asked if he remembered what happened in Dragon Quarter, Clokron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name stirred nothing. His brow knitted as he searched his memory, finding no trace of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He replied at last, &#34;Sorry, I don&#39;t remember much. Have we met before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she read his question, Verena felt a quiet sense of confirmation sette in. It was exactly what she had expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The accident had stolen pieces of Isaac&#39;s memory, but to him, nothing felt missing. He assumed their paths had crossed before and that she was simply a stranger he hadn&#39;t remembered meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, it felt as if his memory had selectively erased her alone, leaving a strange gap only they could navigate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His case was a bit complicated, and the therapy would take time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget it. We&#39;ll talk another time,&#34; she responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His medical history demanded her attention far more than any question about the past. Whatever was wrong with his legs was the real priority; everything else could wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes lingered on the messages she had sent, his lips pressed into a flat,unreadable line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Kaia swept in from outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two servants trailed behind her, each struggling under stacks of books so tall they nearly blocked their view -every one ofthem written by respected medical authorities from around the globe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching her thickest and most treasured volume to her chest, Kaia stepped inside with a satisfied gleam in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Kaia spotted Laura sitting on the sofa, she rushed toward her, eager to spill her excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, look at this!&#34; Kaia&#39;s voice carried a mix of pride and excitement. &#34;I finally got my hands on the latest release by my idol, Evelyn.&#34; She flipped it open and tilted it toward Laura. &#34;Their research is brilliant.The way they see the world of medicine is unlike anyone else. Honestly, I think the person might be a true genius.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone shifted into something wistful. &#34;It&#39;s just... no one knows who the person really is. Aside from a name, we don&#39;t know their nationality, gender, or even what they look like. Meeting them someday would be incredible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s academic excellence had been a constant source of pride, never once causing Laura to worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura reached over and patted herdaughter&#39;s head, smiling warmly. &#34;Kaia, you&#39;re so hardworking and well-mannered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The company would one day belong to her son Luka, so Laura had no plans to involve Kaia in its operations.All she wanted was for her daughter to make a name for herself in a field of her choice and bring prestige to the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile faded as another thought intruded. &#34;Not like Verena, who seems to live for provoking me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Luka&#39;s injuries had been more serious, Laura would have made sure Verena paid the price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia listened in silence, a faint satisfaction settling over her as her mother spoke.</p>
