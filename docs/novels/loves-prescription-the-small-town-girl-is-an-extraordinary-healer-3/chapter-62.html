                <p>Slater let out a dreamy sigh. &#34;If Dr. Willis actually liked me, marrying her would be a good choice to thank her properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter erupted from Barrie as he turned to Slater and said, &#34;That&#39;s not going to work on me. I&#39;m wise to all your frivolous behavior, you brat. There&#39;s no way I&#39;d let Dr. Willis end up upset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater grabbed at his chest with an exaggerated look of pain. &#34;Grandpa, how could you accuse me like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the driver pulled the car to a stop and swung open the rear door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marietta reached over with a smile, giving Slater a pat as he sat by the door. &#34;That&#39;s enough nonsense.Out you go.&#34; Slater straightened up and unfolded his long legs as he climbed out. When his eyes landed on the building ahead, a strange familiarity hit him,especially when he spotted the fountain close by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Assuming his memory hadn&#39;t failed him, he was pretty sure he had seen that same spot before in one of Kaia&#39;s posts online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater blinked in shock. &#34;What are we doing at the Willis family&#39;shouse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrie leaned against his cane with a chuckle. &#34;You mean you didn&#39;t know? Dr. Willis is Alec Willis&#39;daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater froze in astonishment. &#34;Dr. Willis is Alec&#39;s daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Willis family had two girls. One was Kaia, the one he was familiar with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other was Verena, who had only just come back from the countryside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since he already knew Kaia, that left only one possibility...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hold on a second!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could the eldest daughter of the Willis family, the one who had come back from the countryside,actually be Dr.Willis?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater&#39;s mind spun in a storm of disbelief,overflowing with exclamation marks and question marks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Dr. Willis truly turned out to be Verena,then he had already badmouthed her more than once behind her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impossible! Anyone who had spoken ill of Verena must have been spreading lies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater resolved on the spot that he had to apologize to Dr. Willis without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Lyons, at last you&#39;ve arrived.&#34; A lively male voice cut into Slater&#39;s thoughts, and when he lifted his head, Alec and Laura were already waiting near the car.&#34;You&#39;re looking as strong and spirited as ever, Mr.Lyons,&#34; Alec said to Barrie with a broad smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrie chuckled in good humor. &#34;That&#39;s kind of you,but I&#39;m getting on in years-I can&#39;t go anywhere without this cane.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fletcher stepped forward, offering his hand. &#34;Mr.Willis, I&#39;ve heard a great deal about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of surprise flashed in Alec&#39;s eyes-this was the CEO of the renowned Avalon Group, a man he seldom had the chance to meet. Yet today, Fletcher was greeting him with such warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec clasped his hand without hesitation. &#34;I&#39;ve long wanted to meet you, Mr. Lyons. It&#39;s truly a pleasure to at last.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura reached for Marietta&#39;s hand with familiar warmth, speaking as though they were longtime acquaintances. &#34;So the final scarf from S&amp;F found its way to you, Mrs. Lyons. It suits your delicate skin beautifully. I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t mine-it would have been wasted on me.&#34; This was Marietta&#39;s first time meeting Laura, and she thought her manner a touch excessive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, because Laura was the mother of the doctor who had saved Barrie, Marietta let the familiarity pass without complaint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a pleasant smile, she answered, &#34;I actually own another scarf just like this one. If it pleases you, Mrs.Willis, I&#39;ll have it sent over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura gave no clear response but shifted the subject toward Slater instead. &#34;Slater really is impressive. It&#39;s no wonder the girls in Shoildon admire him so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard by the mention, Slater cast Laura a conflicted glance. If Dr. Willis ever learned the things he&#39;d said about her, the shame would be unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came to a firm conclusion that he needed to apologize before she learned the truth on her own.Lost in thought, Slater gave a half-hearted greeting to Laura and said, &#34;Nice to meet you, Mrs. Willis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater kept stretching his neck, trying to get a glimpse into the house, and Alec caught on right away. With a teasing grin, he said, &#34;Slater, looks like you&#39;re pretty eager to catch sight of my daughter,aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint flush crept over Slater&#39;s cheeks as he rubbed the back of his head. &#34;I guess I am a little eager.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally, his nerves were high-after all, he had spoken poorly of Verena more than once, and the weight of guilt pushed him to hurry with an apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the young man&#39;s flustered behavior, Alec gave a satisfied nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Laura was thrilled, convinced that Slater&#39;s blush was proof of affection for Kaia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might not hold the same brilliance as the Bennett brothers, yet the Lyons family&#39;s influence in Shoildon could not be questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should Kaia marry Slater, his straightforward personality would ensure he remained completely under her sway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with Kaia credited for Barrie&#39;s recovery, the Willis family&#39;s standing in Shoildon would be unshakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding back her rising joy, Laura said brightly,&#34;Enough waiting outside, let&#39;s head in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the words left her mouth, Slater bolted straight inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pointing at Slater&#39;s back, Barrie murmured,&#34;That boy never knows how to slow down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec, aware of Slater&#39;s eagerness to see Kaia,chuckled and said, &#34;He&#39;s still young-recklessness suits him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the house, Slater spotted Kaia seated quietly on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s eyes caught his; she smiled softly and brushed a strand of hair behind her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of greeting her, Slater began pacing about,stretching his neck as though hunting for someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Puzzled, Kaia&#39;s brows furrowed as she asked,&#34;Slater, what are you trying to find?&#34; He shot her a quick look but kept silent, still scanning the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His indifference deepened Kaia&#39;s frown, a trace of irritation flickering in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, her voice sharpened as she repeated, &#34;Tell me, what exactly are you searching for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally stopping, Slater turned to her and asked directly, &#34;Where is your elder sister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of disdain crossed Kaia&#39;s expression before she smoothed it over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting upright, she replied with a sharp edge, &#34;She isn&#39;t home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion clouded Slater&#39;s face as his brows drew tight. &#34;Not home? What reason would she have to be away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching his obvious concern at the mention of Verena, Kaia&#39;s irritation flared, and she snapped,&#34;She&#39;s hardly that important. Why should it matter whether she&#39;s here or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater&#39;s tone sharpened as his voice rose. &#34;Of course it matters. The reason we came here today was to meet your sister. How could you say she isn&#39;t important?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words echoed across the living room, reaching Barrie, who was just stepping through the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With two firm taps of his cane, Barrie&#39;s stern voice cut through the air. &#34;Slater, lower your voice. Where are your manners?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater cast a frustrated glance at Kaia before leaning close to Barrie and whispering, &#34;Grandpa, Dr. Willis isn&#39;t here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Willis? Alec and Laura, standing near Barrie,caught the words clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp pang of unease struck Alec the moment he heard it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura, on the other hand, brushed it off and beckoned Kaia to her side. Pulling her daughter close, Laura smiled warmly at Slater. &#34;You really do spoil my Kaia. She&#39;s still in medical school, not yet a doctor. But she&#39;s bright and skilled, and if your grandfather ever needs medical help,you can count on her.&#34;</p>
