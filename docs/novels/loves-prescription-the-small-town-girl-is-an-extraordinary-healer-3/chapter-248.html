                <p>Night had settled over Seraphina Villas, and the peaceful study was bathed in soft lighting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her desk, Verena wrapped up a few charts and files she had brought home from the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emerging from the bathroom, Isaac glanced around,puzzled to find the bedroom empty. In the hallway, a servant carrying a glass of milk passed by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac intercepted her. Knowing Verena was working at the study, he said, relieving the servant of the glass,&#34;Let me handle that. You can go rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant nodded and disappeared down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac opened the door and wheeled himself into the study. Verena looked up when she heard the door,her lips curving into a soft, welcoming smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What brings you by?&#34; she asked, voice warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming over, Isaac set the milk down with care,the warmth of the glass lingering on his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out, lightly touching the tip of her nose.&#34;You get so caught up in your work, I&#39;m worried you&#39;ll forget your husband needs attention too,&#34; he teased. Verena laughed, standing and moving with ease to settle into his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With both hands, she framed his face and pressed a kiss to his lips. &#34;Forget you? Never. How could lignore my charming husband?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The playful reply made Isaac&#39;s chest tighten with happiness, though he kept his tone earnest. &#34;That&#39;s not all I&#39;m worried about. You shouldn&#39;t be pushing yourself. Late nights aren&#39;t good for you, especially now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes softened, and Verena nodded. &#34;I know. It&#39;s nothing complicated tonight,just a little paperwork to get out of the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Isaac&#39;s concern didn&#39;t fade.Sensing his worry,she took his hand, guiding it to rest against her waist,her voice taking on a playful note. &#34;My back feels a little stiff. Think you could give me a massage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she asked, Isaac&#39;s expression shifted to gentle worry, and he started working careful circles against her lower back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands were steady and gentle, as though she were something fragile and dear to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re feeling uncomfortable,&#34; Isaac whispered,his voice low. Verena&#39;s back pain carried a trace of truth, though she leaned on it more than necessary. Pregnancy often brought a dull ache to the lower spine, yet she was only at the beginning, and the strain had not grown sharp enough to trouble her deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a bright smile, she answered, &#34;Thinking about our baby makes everything feel easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s hands worked skillfully, soothing every bit of tension from her lower back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nestled closer, letting herself melt into his warmth,listening to the steady thump of his heart, a look of peace settling over her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, neither of them spoke, and Isaac started to think she had drifted off. Out of the blue, she said,&#34;Something happened at the hospital today. Luis showed up and made a scene.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; name hung in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac frowned. First, Luis tried to ask for Verena&#39;s number. Then, he pushed for a partnership with Bennett Group. And now, he stirred up trouble at her workplace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the thought, Isaac&#39;s demeanor shifted in an instant,his eyes turning cold and sharp. &#34;I&#39;ve clearly been far too patient with him,&#34; he muttered. Catching the tension in his voice, Verena gave his hand a gentle squeeze. &#34;Let&#39;s not dwell on Luis. He didn&#39;t do anything serious, just barked at a couple of nurses.What caught my attention was how Simon reacted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity flickered in Isaac&#39;s eyes. &#34;What did he do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning the silver cufflink on his sleeve between her fingers, Verena replied, &#34;It was exactly like you suspected. Simon acted really protective of me-he burst in as soon as he heard Luis was there,stood up to him, and even grabbed my arms to make sure I was all right. There was real worry in his eyes. If we were just coworkers, he wouldn&#39;t have cared that much.After that, I approached him and tried to probe, but he clammed up. I couldn&#39;t figure out if he&#39;s hiding something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thoughtful look came over lsaac as he continued to massage her waist, his movements never pausing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;ve got a plan,&#34; she chimed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was gentle when he asked, &#34;What do you have in mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on Verena that his hand was still tracing gentle circles on her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle touch, she guided his arms around her  waist and leaned in until her lips brushed against his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding her close, Isaac pressed his chin softly to her shoulder, letting his breath trace along her neck,wrapping the moment in warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tipped her head, her words a soft whisper meant for him alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he hesitated, Verena let out a playful laugh.&#34;What&#39;s this? Are you getting jealous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cheeks flushed a shade deeper. He blinked, voice quiet but honest. &#34;It wasn&#39;t the first time I got jealous,anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer only made her grin wider. Isaac gave a sheepish cough before continuing,&#34;I&#39;ll stay outside,and I&#39;ll ask Jacob to keep an eye out, too. If Simon tries anything, he&#39;ll regret ever setting foot near you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing how serious he&#39;d become, Verena slipped her hand under his chin, lifting his face with a teasing smile. &#34;Turns out Mr. Bennett can be pretty fierce when it comes to protecting his wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look she gave him stopped him cold. For a heartbeat, he lost himself in the sparkle of her eyes and the curve of her lips, completely disarmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing but adoration in his gaze, his longing laid bare for her to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without a word, Isaac cupped the back of her head and pulled her in for a deep, lingering kiss. Morning sunlight spilled into the penthouse suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon, barely awake, groaned and fumbled for his phone,half-heartedly checking his notifications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A message from Verena suddenly appeared, jolting him fully awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat up straight, blinking hard as if to make sure he wasn&#39;t dreaming, and hurried to open her message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena asked, &#34;Dr. Moss, if you have time this morning,would you like to join me for breakfast at nine thirty?I&#39;d like to talk with you about something personal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All trace of sleep vanished. Simon read her invitation over and over, a wide grin breaking across his face, his heart pounding with excitement, eyes alight with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had actually sent the invitation herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d reached out, asking him to meet with her-just the two of them. It wasn&#39;t for work. No one else would be joining. This was a private meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For someone who usually kept her distance, her invitation for a private meeting meant something,even if just for breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon couldn&#39;t help but wonder if maybe, just maybe,she cared about him more than she let on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea took root in his mind, making his heart race the longer he considered it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope lit a spark in Simon, pulling him from bed with a burst of energy. He hustled to the bathroom,splashed water on his face, and spent a long moment in front of the mirror, perfecting every strand of his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His closet became a stage as he weighed one shirt against another, fussing over jackets and ties until he found the look that felt just right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The prospect of having breakfast alone with Verena had him smiling like a schoolboy with a secret crush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, Simon stood at the entrance of the restaurant, nerves fluttering in his stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped inside, caught sight of Verena waiting at a corner table, and hurried over. &#34;Sorry if I kept you waiting,&#34; he said, his voice stumbling over itself. Verena&#39;s eyes swept over him as he drew near.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no missing the effort he put in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crisp black suit framed his shoulders, every seam and button in perfect place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hair looked freshly styled, glinting softly under the lights, and not a single lock dared to stray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gleaming watch rested on his wrist, and his shoes were so spotless, they looked brand new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She realized she had never seen Simon put together with this much care before.</p>
