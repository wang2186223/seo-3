                <p>Kaia had basked in praise all her life, yet today&#39;s compliment struck her heart like a long-awaited triumph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt sweeter than all the others, a mixture of joy and relief, as though she had finally found a steadfast ally in Barrie. She even wondered if those rich ladies who once looked down on her for her modest background would still dare to sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart fluttered, but on the surface she wore calm composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping forward with a gentle smile and a well-mannered tone, Kaia addressed Barrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed, Mr. Lyons. I heard before about your serious leg ailment. Had I known earlier that the herbs and supplements I prepared could help, I would never have waited until your son and daughter-in-law&#39;s wedding anniversary to send them. I would have delivered them right away, sparing you so much pain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved gracefully, yet she remained unaware of the strange looks exchanged among the Lyons family at her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrie&#39;s brows drew together, his gaze shadowed with regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like fire erupting from a mountain, Slater burst out.&#34;Herbs and supplements? What are you talking about? My grandfather&#39;s leg was healed through Dr.Willis&#39; careful treatment, step by step. Stop dressing yourself in borrowed robes! Those so-called herbs and supplements you speak of were passed on to the servants the very night they arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, and then shot Kaia a scornful glance.&#34;So you really believed it was you who cured my grandfather&#39;s leg?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mockery was sharp, and the Willis family&#39;s faces turned ashen, drained of color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was plain: Kaia had not cured Barrie. It was nothing more than a misunderstanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Willis family had clung to the false notion that a few boxes of herbs and supplements could undo decades of suffering. They had mistaken wishful thinking for reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec looked at Kaia with a heavy expression, the weight of disappointment clear in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia herself stood pale and shaken, disbelief flickering across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows trembled as she recalled the sight of Verena at Barrie&#39;s residence that evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that Verena was the very Dr. Willis they now spoke of? The healer who had restored Barrie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s heart resisted the thought. To her, Verena had only learned a few skills from a self-taught practitioner in the backwater place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet reality pressed in-uncomfortable, undeniable.They shared the same surname, and Verena had indeed been at the Lyons home that evening. The thought made Kaia&#39;s chest tighten; her hands clenched so hard that her nails cut into her palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Verena truly was the one who healed Barrie,Kaia resolved to bury it deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she had to swallow her pride and shoulder the blame herself, she would never allow the Lyons family to find out Verena was the Dr. Willis they spoke of.That, she decided, was a price worth paying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting down hard on the inside of her cheek, Kaia forced herself to bow before Barrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice trembled wvith contrition. &#34;Mr. Lyons, I truly apologize. After I sent the gifts, I saw Slater&#39;s post online and mistakenly believed I had been the one to cure your leg. It was my mistake, and I am deeply sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From their exchange, Barrie pieced together the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though disappointment touched him, his good manners kept his face composed. He gave Kaia a measured glance but withheld any reply. Instead, he sighed softly and turned to Alec.&#34;Mr. Willis, since Dr. Willis isn&#39;t here, let&#39;s not trouble you further.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, signaling to Fletcher and the others, he added,&#34;Let&#39;s head home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassment weighed heavily on Alec, but he still had one matter he dared not leave unspoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a forced smile, he followed and said, &#34;Mr. Lyons,about the club...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrie, without turning, raised his hand in dismissal.&#34;Mr. Willis, not today. There&#39;s no need to see us out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ride home was cloaked in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater leaned his arm against the window, his brows drawn as he wrestled with his thoughts about Dr.Willis&#39; whereabouts. He hadn&#39;t seen her since she completed the final treatment for his grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had hoped to thank her face-to-face, but today&#39;s visit had been fruitless. Her phone was disconnected, the number invalid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oddly enough, he felt a trace of relief that the Willis family had mistaken Kaia for the healer. At least that proved Dr. Willis wasn&#39;t one of them-just a woman who happened to share the surname.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And since Bobby&#39;s influence had long soured his opinion of the Willis family, Slater found comfort in that fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, Dr. Willis had no ties to them at all.</p>
