                <p>In the CEO&#39;s office of Sampson Group, Luis sat in his leather chair, shoulders hunched over a sea of paperwork, eyes scanning line after line of text.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock sounded against the frosted glass door. He rubbed at his temples, easing the dull ache there, and looked up just as the door creaked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena peeked in, a bright smile on her lips and an insulated food container tucked carefully in her arms.Isaac trailed after her,balancing an elegant meal box as though it were something precious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luis,&#34; Verena called, her voice carrying an eager warmth that instantly lifted the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sight of her, Luis set aside his pen and shifted past the scattered reports, his gaze catching on the container she held. &#34;And what have you brought me this time? So mysterious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Verena could answer, Isaac stepped forward,smoothly taking the container from her hands and setting it on the coffee table beside the meal box.&#34;Marisa made borscht for Verena,&#34; he explained.&#34;Verena said you&#39;ve been working yourself ragged and skipping breakfasts. She thought you might need this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis reached for the container, the quiet click of the lid snapping open ringing in the stillness. It hit him all at once-the aroma, the faint warmth curling into the air. A pang tightened in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marisa hadn&#39;t cooked in ages-not since her illness had taken that part of her from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been years since he&#39;d tasted the flavors she used to prepare with such care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In that case,&#34; he said, his voice gentling as his eyes glistened faintly, &#34;thanks to Verena, I can enjoy Mom&#39;s cooking again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena carefully drew out a porcelain bowl, delicate as a piece of art, and ladled in the steaming soup.&#34;Then try it now,&#34; she urged with a playful smile. &#34;Mom even added her secret spice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She passed the bowl into his waiting hands. Luis held it a moment longer than necessary, fingers tightening around the smooth ceramic, before he finally lowered his head and took a bite with a spoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The broth was hot, rolling down his throat with the gentle bite of pepper, the sweetness of tomato, and the hearty depth of beef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Over twenty years,&#34; he murmured, his voice husky,  thumb tracing the rim of the bowl as though it grounded him. &#34;It still tastes just as good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His knuckles whitened against the porcelain, and Verena, noticing the strain, slipped down onto the sofa beside him. She placed a light hand on his, smiled,and gave it a reassuring pat. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Luis,&#34;&#39; she said gently. &#34;There will always be more chances like this. Oh,by the way...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pivoted the conversation with practiced ease.&#34;Has Miranda reached out to you lately? Yesterday she wouldn&#39;t stop pestering me about the new jewelry line at Sampson Group-insisted she had to try on the bracelets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone was in her hand before Luis could answer.The glow of the screen lit her face, sharpening the impish curve of her mouth. &#34;See? She was desperate enough to blow up my messages. I didn&#39;t even dare reply.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis lowered the bowl carefully, his lips parting as though to respond-but a sharp knock on the door cut through the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, Rowland requests an audience,&#34; came the assistant&#39;s voice from outside, level and formal, every syllable crisp against the quiet office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The interruption snapped the air taut. Luis&#39; expression  hardened, his eyes instinctively flicking toward the frosted glass door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, sensing the shift,tucked away her phone, her earlier playfulness vanishing like mist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac bent quickly to straighten the clutter on the coffee table, his movements discreet, almost ceremonial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat later, Luis lifted his brows in the faintest acknowledgment, his face unreadable as he opened the file before him. &#34;Send him in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swung wide a breath later.Rowland stepped inside with a smile polished too brightly, his eyes betraying the jitter beneath it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone with Luis, he advanced to the desk, inclining his head in stiff deference. &#34;Good morning,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis met his greeting with a calm, unblinking stare.When he finally spoke, his voice was even, measured -controlled. &#34;What brings you here, Rowland?&#34;</p>
