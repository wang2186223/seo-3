                <p>After Verena left, the group sank into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34; A playful voice broke through the hush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby, Slater, and Kaia all turned to Gavin, confusion written across their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin touched his throbbing lip, forced a crooked smile, rolled up his sleeves, and fixed his eyes on Bobby. &#34;So-you&#39;re Isaac&#39;s brother, are you? Well, I&#39;m not one to let debts linger. That punch you gave me earlier... I believe it&#39;s time the scales were balanced,don&#39;t you think so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Gavin lunged and threw a punch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby realized too late; the blow landed squarely on his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Already irritated by Kaia&#39;s sharp remarks, Bobby&#39;s temper now ignited like dry tinder struck by flint. He ground his teeth. &#34;You think justice is that simple?You hit me, and I&#39;ll see to it you pay the price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Bobby kicked at Gavin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Gavin was ready, stepping aside with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby, unfazed, balled his fist again, swinging with renewed fury. The two men collided once more, fists flying in a storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater, the only one clinging to reason, pushed forward to break them apart, his hand reaching for Bobby&#39;s shoulder. &#34;Stop it, enough! Didn&#39;t you hear?He&#39;s Dr. Willis&#39; friend, don&#39;t-ah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cry tore the air. Bobby&#39;s punch, dodged by Gavin,had landed squarely on Slater&#39;s face instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater felt fire blaze through his left eye. Wincing, he steadied himself and reached for Gavin. &#34;We&#39;re on the same side-stop this, stop-damn!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cursed under his breath, staggering back, his right eye already swelling into a dark bruise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing another punch aimed his way, Slater barked, &#34;Damn it! If I&#39;m the one getting hit, then I&#39;m hitting back!&#34; He tightened his fists and retaliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so, the three of them spiraled into a chaotic scuffle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bar&#39;s patrons, well-accustomed to such nightly storms, paid little mind. Some even watched with mild amusement, as if the brawl were nothing more than tonight&#39;s entertainment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at that-people with disabilities come to bars too?&#34; A woman&#39;s mocking voice cut across the noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads turned toward the entrance. There, half-shadowed beneath dim lights, sat a man in a navy trench coat, confined to a wheelchair yet radiating a presence that made the air heavier. His features were veiled, but his authority was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you believe it? Still comes to a bar for fun despite the chair,&#34; someone scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep your voices down,&#34; another muttered. &#34;Didn&#39;t you notice the men behind him? Those aren&#39;t just bodyguards-they&#39;re wolves in suits.&#34; As if to prove the point, one towering figure in a black suit turned his gaze their way. His eyes, sharp as blades, sent a chill through the crowd, and in an instant, the onlookers fell silent, retreating into their drinks and dice games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia heard those patrons&#39; words and turned toward the door. Her brows drew tight. Could it be lsaac?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, her suspicion was confirmed-lsaac was indeed here, and the sight left her cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, for his part, paid no heed to the whispers. He&#39;d heard too many to care. His thoughts clung only to Verena. His eyes, cold and unwavering, swept ahead -where three figures wrestled by the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguard closest to lsaac caught sight of one of the fighters and leaned in, his voice low. &#34;Mr.Bennett, isn&#39;t that your brother up ahead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac swept his gaze across the room. Verena was nowhere in sight, yet one jacket among the three brawlers was all too familiar-it matched the photograph Verena had sent him earlier. His eyes narrowed, a shard of cold light flickering within. &#34;Break them apart,&#34; he ordered, his tone like steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bring me the man in the brown jacket.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguard bowed slightly. &#34;Yes, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fight was stillraging when Bobby lifted his leg to strike Gavin again-only to find himself hauled into the air by his collar,feet kicking helplessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater lunged at Gavin, teeth bared in desperation,but he too was seized by the collar, dangling as though gravity itself had forsaken him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! Who the hell-&#34; Bobby&#39;s curse halted the moment his eyes rose to the man holding him.Recognition lit his face. &#34;Oh, it&#39;s you, Hawley! You came to back us up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater, too, recognized the bodyguard instantly-Hawley Aston, the Bennett family&#39;s most trusted guardian. A surge of relief and confidence flooded both men. Surely Hawley would deal with Gavin on their behalf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet their hopes dissolved in an instant. With effortless strength, Hawley held them aside as if they were no more than rag dolls. He tossed Bobby and Slater away without ceremony, and then turned on Gavin. Before Gavin even grasped what had happened,Hawley had lifted him off his feet and carried him off like a hawk clutching its prey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin thrashed in resistance, but against a former mercenary like Hawley, his struggle was as useless as a moth battering against glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hawley stopped before Isaac and spoke with military crispness.&#34;Mr.Bennett, I&#39;ve brought him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s hands tightened on the armrests of his wheelchair, his voice colder than the bite of winter.&#34;Where&#39;s Verena?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Gavin could shape an answer, Bobby burst forward, seizing the chance to complain. &#34;Isaac, it&#39;s this man! You must let Hawley teach him a lesson. He didn&#39;t just hug your future wife-he kissed her!I saw it with my own eyes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his rush, Bobby twisted the truth, confusing wanted to kiss with kissed-yet in his mind, both sins weighed the same. Gavin was guilty either way. Isaac&#39;s grip hardened, his gaze cutting into Gavin like twin blades.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin opened his mouth to deny, but then paused.He recalled his exchange with Verena. He had already done enough to stir lsaac&#39;s jealousy; now he wished to test whether lsaac&#39;s trust in her ran deeper than suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing himself upright despite his bruises, Gavin smoothed his dlisheveled clothes and spoke with calm, deliberate poise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what? Dr. Willis is single. A gentleman has every right to pursue a lady. The way I pursue her is my affair. As long as Dr. Willis herself raises no objection,the rest of you-who matter little in this-have no right to pass judgment.&#34;</p>
