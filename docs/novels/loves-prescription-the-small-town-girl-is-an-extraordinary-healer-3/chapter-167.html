                <p>When Verena read the message, she felt no storm in her heart. She had already foreseen that once Katelyn learned she was abroad, she would seize the moment to act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening the attached photo, Verena studied it intently,her eyes sharp as a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn, just like her, was a doctor. She had slipped medicine into Kaia&#39;s hands, who was now living at Seraphina Villas and could easily approach Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The intention behind that medicine seemed painfully clear to Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for her phone to call Isaac, wanting to sound the alarm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the call never connected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause to gather her thoughts, she dialed Bobby instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered at once, pleasantly surprised. &#34;Verena,is this real? You&#39;re actually calling me?&#34; A soft chuckle escaped her lips. &#34;Yes, it&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby&#39;s voice bubbled with excitement. &#34;Isaac told me you were overseas.When are you coming back?Once you return, I&#39;ll treat both you and lsaac to a meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moved by his warm sincerity, Verena agreed, &#34;It should only be a few more days. I&#39;ll reach out when I return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of sharing a meal with his flawless sister-in-law had Bobby practically walking on air. &#34;Perfect,then it&#39;s settled. You mustn&#39;t go back on your word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena laughed lightly before her tone shifted to seriousness. &#34;Bobby, before that, I need you to do me a favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He replied eagerly, &#34;Of course, Verena. Just say the word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena explained, &#34;Since Kaia moved into Seraphina Villas, I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on her. MMy detective just informed me that she met Katelyn, who handed her a packet of medicine. No doubt it&#39;s something shady. I tried reaching Isaac, but he didn&#39;t answer, so I&#39;m telling you instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that Kaia and Katelyn were working hand in glove, Bobby cursed. &#34;Those two women are truly birds of a feather-brazen enough to scheme against  Isaac! I&#39;ll teach them a lesson this very instant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he made to rush out, Verena stopped him,saying,&#34;Bobby, don&#39;t be reckless. I already have a plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His curiosity piqued, Bobby quickly asked, &#34;What&#39;s the plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lips curved into a cold smile. &#34;Go to Seraphina Villas, but don&#39;t interfere with Kaia&#39;s actions.Let her believe her scheme is working,and then we&#39;ll flip the table on them. Once she slips the drug, find a reason to lead her away. By then, Katelyn should appear, and you can...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby listened closely, and by the end he was both impressed and proud. No wonder she was his perfect sister-in-law-calm in the storm and able to turn danger into opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With admiration swelling, Bobby pounded his chest over the phone. &#34;Leave it to me. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll make sure Isaac comes to no harm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing his confidence,Verena burst into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia returned to Seraphina Villas and spotted Isaac&#39;s car in the garage-proof of his return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the living room, she found him seated on the  sofa,absorbed in a financial newspaper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t so much as glance her way or ask where she had been, and even Rhonda didn&#39;t greet her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A suffocating weight pressed on Kaia; never before had anyone treated her as if she were made of air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to flare up, Rhonda&#39;s cheerful voice rang out. &#34;Mr. Bobby Bennett,what brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia turned her head and saw Bobby stroll in, hands buried in his pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned faintly. Why had Bobby come at this hour?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby shot her a scornful glance, and then said brightly to Rhonda, &#34;Just dropped by for a meal and to check on lsaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda chuckled heartily. &#34;Well then, perfect timing.One mnore dish and everything&#39;s ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac looked up at his brother. &#34;Does Mom know you&#39;re here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clicking his tongue, Bobby dropped into the seat beside him. &#34;I&#39;m not a child who reports every move to our mother.&#34; Isaac lowvered his head again and continued with his paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Bobby seemed to remember something.&#34;Hey, is your phone dead? I called earlier but you didn&#39;t pick up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac instinctively reached for his pocket, and then paused before replying, &#34;I left it in the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I see.&#34; Bobby quickly handed over his phone,brimming with fake enthusiasm. &#34;I found a few sneakers I like, but I can&#39;t decide. Mind giving me your opinion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s brow furrowed. Bobby never hesitated when it came to spending money, so his hesitation now had to mean something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, when Isaac looked at the phone, a line of text flashed before him. &#34;Verena told me Kaia,under Katelyn&#39;s orders, plans to drug you. I&#39;ll lead her away later-someone else will handle the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danger flickered in Isaac&#39;s narrowed eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet he swiftly masked it, remarking casually,&#34;They&#39;re all good.Why not buy them all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment,Kaia leaned forward curiously. &#34;Isaac,what are you two discussing?&#34; Bobby quickly pocketed his phone and shot her a dismissive look. &#34;Even if I told you, you wouldn&#39;t get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her enthusiasm smothered under a cold refusal, Kaia clenched her teeth but forced out a brittle laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dinner&#39;s ready,&#34; Rhonda announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring Kaia, Bobby wheeled Isaac to the dining table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though her stomach churned with frustration,Kaia plastered on a smile and followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, night fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Isaac was about to enter the elevator, he told Bobby,&#34;Stay downstairs for a while. I have some work to finish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the doors closed, Bobby stretched out on the sofa,absorbed in a game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda cleared the dishes and warmed a glass of milk for Isaac, as Verena had instructed before leaving-knowing warm milk eased his sleeplessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment Rhonda began tidying, Kaia&#39;s eyes searched for a chance to slip in the drug. But with Rhonda bustling about and Bobby seated in the living room, no opening appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her patience thinned, until finally Rhonda left the  warmed milk on the counter and disappeared into the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s eyes gleamed. From the corner of her gaze,she checked on Bobby-he was sprawled on the sofa,exclaiming now and then, &#34;Awesome!&#34; at his game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the moment, she drew out the packet and poured the powder into the milk, stirring quickly to disguise it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The toilet flushed. Kaia hurried back to the coffee table, lifting a cup of water and sipping slowly as if nothing had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, the plan was flawless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she didn&#39;t realize was that Bobby had seen it all reflected on the wall opposite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Rhonda emerged and carried the milk upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia prepared to follow, but Bobby suddenly stood and called her over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She froze, forcing a smile. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby feigned urgency, pulling her toward the door.&#34;Ah! I nearly forgot something important-just came back to me now!&#34; Irritation flashed across Kaia&#39;s face. She longed to hurry upstairs, yet Bobby was dragging her out.&#34;What&#39;s so urgent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Slater asked me to fetch you,&#34; Bobby insisted.&#34;Said there&#39;s something he needs to consult you about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia frowned.Slater wanted her advice? Then she remembered Verena treating Barrie. Could it be his illness had returned?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice trembled with curiosity. &#34;Is something wrong with Barrie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby hesitated briefly, and then nodded. &#34;Yes, it&#39;s about Barrie. Aren&#39;t you studying medicine? Go take a look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Kaia sneered inwardly. So Verena&#39;s so-called cure was nothing but a bluff.With Verena gone,she alone could save Barrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smug smile tugged at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby, watching her, felt disgust coil in his chest. He had never met such a self-satisfied woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the task now was to lead her away. He bundled her into the car and drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, Kaia remembered Isaac. By now, he  must have already drunk the milk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking this, she secretly texted Katelyn before locking the phone screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the rear-view mirror, Bobby caught her movements and smirked. He almost laughed aloud at their foolishness-they were digging their own graves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn, upon receiving Kaia&#39;s message,hurried to Seraphina Villas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house lay quiet as she called out, &#34;Kaia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed. Could it be...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly burst into laughter. Never had she imagined that foolish Kaia, instead of ruining things at the crucial moment,would present her such a gift-clearing the path so she alone could have lsaac.</p>
