                <p>When Kaia revealed that her idol was Evelyn-the same woman he was dining with-Wendell let out a warm laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia was always active in class. Her genuine love for medicine was impossible to miss, and that spark amused Wendell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome to ask me anything that confuses you,&#34;said Wendell, leaning forward slightly. &#34;Medicine isn&#39;t for the faint of heart, but your energy tells me you can handle the challenge. In fact, I&#39;ve got something you&#39;ll want to hear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lit up instantly. &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelyn will be giving a lecture at our university this year. Only two hundred seats are available, but I can make sure one of them has your name on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news hit her like a rush of adrenaline. &#34;Are you serious? Evelyn&#39;s really coming here to speak?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Completely serious,&#34; Wendell replied with a certain smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia couldn&#39;t hold back the excitement that burst out of her before she had the chance to stop it. &#34;Professor Branson, this is incredible! Thank you, thank you so much! Meeting Evelyn has been my dream for as long as I can remember. She&#39;s the greatest physician alive in my book.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell brushed her gratitude aside with a light wave. &#34;Save your thanks. I can&#39;t keep my role model waiting.Goodbye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia gave a quick nod, though her curiosity flared. Who could possibly inspire a man like Wendell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question tugged at her until she found herself trailing after him at a careful distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched him disappear into a private dining room, and her gaze stretched toward the doorway.The figure inside was undeniably a woman, and shockingly young. Could someone like that truly be Wendell&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>role model?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawn by intrigue, Kaia edged closer to the door. The woman sat turned slightly away, long hair cascading down like a curtain that hid her face completely. No matter how she craned her neck, Kaia couldn&#39;t get a proper look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The food&#39;s gone,&#34; said Wendell from inside, his tone light with amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia had just started to lean in for a clearer look when the door shut in front of her. Curiosity lingered, and she still hoped to catch a glimpse of the woman Wendell looked up to. Even so, the thought didn&#39;t trouble her for long. What truly mattered now was that she was finally about to meet the person she had admired for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the feminine ring of the name Evelyn, Kaia had always pictured the famed medical author as a man -tall, refined, and striking, with the kind of presence that turned heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind still busy painting that picture, she pulled out her phone on the way to the restroom and began typing with excitement. &#34;Two incredible reasons to celebrate! Just found out that my lifelong idol, Evelyn Rowe, will be giving a lecture at our school, and Professor Branson has reserved me a spot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The post took off in seconds, her notifications filling with reactions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way! Are you talking about the legendary surgical genius Evelyn Rowe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t the mysterious doctor supposed to be impossible to track down? Kaia, you&#39;re unbelievable! How did you find this out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelyn&#39;s my inspiration too! I wish I&#39;d gotten into Acorith College of Medicine. Please stream it for us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s chest swelled with pride as the comments poured in. Evelyn&#39;s name carried weight, and knowing she was part of that moment made her glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere in the restaurant, Wendell leaned toward Verena with a grin. &#34;You&#39;ll never guess who I bumped into outside-a female student who practically thinks you hung the moon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so? Why didn&#39;t you bring her over to get my autograph?&#34; Verena teased, one brow raised. Wendell let out a laugh as he gestured toward her. &#34;You&#39;re so good at disappearing, I wouldn&#39;t even know where to find you if I brought someone by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena took a slow sip of water, entirely unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the restroom, Kaia stepped into a different private room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smoothing her hair back, she offered a polite smile. &#34;I&#39;m sorry for keeping you waiting,Mr.Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Bobby sipped lazily through a straw, not even acknowledging her apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Kaia leaned forward slightly. &#34;Speaking of waiting, what happened last time you invited me out?1was there for quite a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something came up,&#34; he said flatly, brushing it aside. &#34;Let&#39;s just talk business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows knitted for a brief moment at his tone, but she quickly smoothed her expression. A man of his standing was bound to carry a certain detachment, she reasoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing a pleasant nod, Kaia asked, &#34;All right. What&#39;s your plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby said indifferently, &#34;If I had one, we wouldn&#39;t be meeting here at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to rival companies, Bobby could dream up strategies in his sleep. But taking down a woman who had no real defenses? That wasn&#39;t something he had an easy answer for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s teeth caught her lower lip as she feigned uncertainty. &#34;Let me think...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment Bobby brought up the idea of teaming up, Kaia had already begun shaping the perfect setup in her head. Her birthday celebration was just around the corner, and it would be the ideal stage. If Verena happened to get caught stealing something during such a grand affair, the consequences would be swift and irreversible. The Bennett family would never let a woman with a stain like that marry into their family, and the marriage alliance would unravel effortlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia had already pictured the scene where Verena would be publicly embarrassed, and the thought filled her with anticipation.From the beginning, she struggled with the idea of sharing her parents&#39; attention with someone else. The moment she met Verena, she found her cold detachment infuriating. What made things worse was that Verena showed no interest in trying to win her over, not even pretending to be agreeable. That quiet defiance only deepened her resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, if anything devious was to happen, she knew better than to let herself appear behind it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows drew together as she played at thinking hard. &#34;Honestly, I&#39;ve got nothing. Maybe I should ask a friend of mine. She&#39;s never short on ideas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby saw right through her little act, though he let it slide without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; he said simply, his tone unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With phone in hand, Kaia tapped at the screen with exaggerated purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, she gave a bright little gasp. &#34;She wrote back already!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, her inbox was as empty as her performance was rehearsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With mock seriousness, she glanced at the screen andthen announced, &#34;She thinks we should set Verena up. Something like making it look like she stole something. The Bennett family wouldn&#39;t stomach that in a daughter-in-law, right? Especially when she&#39;s already lied to you about her education. That would give your family every reason to call off the arrangement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby leaned back, his gaze steady and deliberate as it rested on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That look chipped at her confidence, and she softened her voice. &#34;You probably think this is too low, don&#39;t you?If you want, I&#39;ll tell her to forget it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby watched the way she acted, all sweetness and flair, and sneered inwardly. The whole performance struck him as nothing but a polished lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet his answer was plain. &#34;If the result works in our favor, the rest doesn&#39;t matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their discussion wrapped up quickly after that, and Bobby wasted no time coming up with a reason to leave. Once outside, he reached for his phone and dialed a familiar contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater answered without hesitation, &#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need an update,&#34; Bobby said. &#34;Have you found anything about the woman who pulled me out of trouble that day?&#34;</p>
