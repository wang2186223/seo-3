                <p>Kaia had penned the letter while at school and mailed it from there, so the return address bore the school&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fellow student, returning from the mailroom, told her that a letter had arrived in her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bewildered yet curious, Kaia made her way toward the mailroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally received the envelope and unfolded its contents, she stood rooted to the spot,her heart suspended between joy and disbelief, before she could gather herself again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In that letter, you reminded me that ability and skill are the true passports in life. You told me never to force myself into circles; with genuine ability, the circles I long for will one day formn naturally around me.&#34; Tears welled in Kaia&#39;s eyes and cascaded down without delay. &#34;So I swore to devote myself to medicine, to carve my name as a physician like you.You pulled me back when I was drifting aimlessly.Evelyn, you must believe me-! could never bring myself to harm you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words rang with sincerity, yet Verena&#39;s heart remained unmoved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The damage had already been done, and no river of words could wash it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena fixed her gaze on Kaia, the name &#34;Grace&#34;surfacing in her memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, when she had first read the letter, it was drenched in despair, written by someone teetering on the edge with strong thoughts of ending their life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a doctor, her duty was to save lives, so she had replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never had she imagined that Grace was none other than Kaia. Verena&#39;s lips curved faintly, almost ironically. &#34;So,you are Grace. And because I am Evelyn,you now hope to reconcile with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia knew full well her sins were too many to erase.Forgiveness was out of reach, yet if she could make even the smallest amends, she would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking her head quickly, she pleaded, &#34;I know my wrongs are beyond forgiveness. I don&#39;t seek pardon -only that you trust me this once. The real danger now lies with Katelyn. She told me that tomorrow she&#39;ll keep lsaac occupied, and then I must inform you that lsaac has been taken away in a car-with her inside. She wants me to lure you to an abandoned factory on the outskirts, where she plans to have you kidnapped. If I refuse, she&#39;ll simply find another accomplice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia lifted her face, her expression taut with urgency.&#34;Evelyn, beware of Katelyn-she&#39;s set on revenge against you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes narrowed. It was indeed likely that Katelyn intended to strike before her departure. But could Kaia&#39;s words truly be trusted?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena studied her, her mind already charting a course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Kaia spoke the truth, this could be the perfect snare to crush Katelyn once and for all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Kaia lied, Verena would strike first. She would lay a trap, ensuring neither of them could rise again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For now, I&#39;ll trust you. But if I discover you&#39;ve lied,the price will be one you cannot even imagine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s eyes lit up in disbelief, tears shimmering.&#34;Evelyn, do you really trust me this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reverence seemed genuine. Though Verena did not fully grant her trust, she gave her words weight-yet not without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Folding her arms, Verena leaned closer, her gaze sharp. &#34;As long as you follow my lead, I will place trust in you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia nodded eagerly, almost breathless. &#34;Yes, yes, I&#39;ll  do as you say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena bent down, whispering instructions into her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After returning to her room from Seraphina Villas,Kaia pulled out her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She searched her contacts for Katelyn&#39;s name and pressed dial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Katelyn picked up, her brows arched knowingly. She understood Kaia&#39;s deep hatred for Verena, and all seemed to be unfolding according to her design.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,have you made up your mind?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia gritted her teeth, answering firmly, &#34;Yes, l&#39;ve thought it through. Verena must not remain in my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s lipscurled in satisfaction, convinced that when interests collided, family ties snapped like twigs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did it matter if Verena was Evelyn? Despite Kaia&#39;s admiration, she was still willing to betray her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Katelyn&#39;s eyes, Kaia was nothing more than a well-placed pawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Admiring her manicured nails, Katelyn drawled, &#34;In that case, I&#39;ll entrust you with the task of bringing Verena there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s eyes flickered with a glint of amusement.With subtle words, she sought to coax Katelyn into revealing proof of her scheme.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning unease, she asked, &#34;Katelyn, are you sure everything is arranged? Suppose I bring Verena to the abandoned factory, and your people aren&#39;t there yet-what if she manages to slip away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn scoffed at her supposed hesitation.-&#34;Don&#39;t worry. That won&#39;t happen. My people will be stationed there an hour before you arrive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour early. Kaia&#39;s lips tilted into a faint smile. &#34;That&#39;s good,then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing as if in afterthought, she voiced another doubt. &#34;But once you have Verena, how will you deal with her? I&#39;m merely following your orders to bring her there. If she escapes and reports me, I&#39;ll be the one arrested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaia, you underestimate me.&#34; Katelyn chuckled coldly. &#34;Once Verena falls into my grasp, I won&#39;t give her a chance to run. She&#39;ll disappear without a trace,and even the police will find nothing. Afterward,I&#39;ll leave this country. With Verena gone, no one will testify, and suspicion won&#39;t touch you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia nodded slowly. &#34;Alright, that eases my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impatient, Katelyn wrapped up their conversation briskly. &#34;Enough talk. Tomorrow, after | keep lsaac occupied, I&#39;ll have someone send you a photo as proof. Once my people call, you&#39;ll take Verena to the factory without delay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia assured her, &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll make sure she&#39;s there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Katelyn hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia stared at the screen, her eyes resting on the recording time, a mocking smile tugging at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Kaia left, Verena immediately sent lsaac a message,relaying Katelyn&#39;s plot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her intent had been merely to inform him, so he could prepare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet unexpectedly, Isaac called at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she picked up, his voice came urgent through the line. &#34;Verena, why don&#39;t I send someone to drive Katelyn out of the country right now? That way you won&#39;t have to risk anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena said with a calm smile, &#34;That isn&#39;t necessary.Since she wants to use this scheme against me, I&#39;ll see that she bears the full weight of it. Exile won&#39;t restrain her; for someone like her, only prison bars &lt;</p>
