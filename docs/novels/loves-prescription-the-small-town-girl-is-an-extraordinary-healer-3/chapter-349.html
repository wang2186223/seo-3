                <p>Jared&#39;s face drained of every trace of confidence when Verena handed down her verdict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear wrapped around him, suffocating any bravado he had left about his title as deputy general manager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ignored the stares burning into him from every corner of the room and shot up from his chair, panic driving his movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The metal legs shrieked as he shoved the chair back,slicing through the tension in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hurried to Verena&#39;s side, bowing his head, hands clasped together, desperation plain in his eyes. &#34;I lost my way. Greed got the better of me-I&#39;m begging you,let me fix this. Please, just give me one more chance.I swear I won&#39;t slip up again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unmoved, Verena&#39;s eyes hardened as she met his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words came out crispand cold. &#34;Jared, our rules exist for a reason. If I look the other way,what message does that send to everyone else? Go sit down. The investigation is moving forward, and you&#39;ll answer for your actions.&#34; Mixed emotions chased each other across Jared&#39;s cheeks. Shoulders drooping, he trudged back to his seat,unable to meet anyone&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody in the room had expected Verena to drop the hammer so quickly, especially not on someone shielded by Molly. Her decisiveness sent ripples of shock across the table-some even dared to compare her resolve to that of her brother, Luis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of them saw Verena as an outsider,someone who didn&#39;t fully understand the ruthless nature of corporate power. They assumed she would tread carefully, too cautious to challenge how things were already being done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,she left them reeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some executives stared with open mouths, too surprised to hide their disbelief. A few furrowed their brows, casting nervous glances between Verena and Jared, silently tallying their own infractions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Others shot wary looks at each other, a flicker of dread in their eyes. Ties to Jared suddenly felt dangerous, and they wondered who might be called out next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden voice broke the tension.&#34;Ms. Guzman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s tone cut through the hush, drawing every eye  to the woman in question. Clarissa Guzman, known for her flawless appearance and meticulous style,stiffened in her seat. Her hands clenched under the table, and her practiced smile barely held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Bennett...&#34; Clarissa&#39;s voice trembled, betraying her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence fell as all attention shifted to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena leaned forward,lacing her fingers together on the table. Her voice was steady and deliberate. &#34;Ms.Guzman, I&#39;ve reviewed last month&#39;s marketing expenses. Not only was the budget blown, but the results were disappointing, and the financial records are a mess. As the head of the project, I&#39;d like you to walk me through what happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes wide, Clarissa averted her gaze, searching for words as pressure mounted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush settled over the table as Clarissa tried to steady her nerves. With forced composure, she said,&#34;Mrs. Bennett, I assure you, there&#39;s been a big misunderstanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena didn&#39;t blink. She cocked her head to one side,a wry glint in her eyes, silently daring Clarissa to keep going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fidgeting with the hem of her sleeve, Clarissa continued, &#34;The marketing campaign was on track  until our partner blindsided us. They jacked up the fees at the last minute. I had to accept their terms just to keep everything from falling apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every sentence was punctuated by nervous glances toward Verena, as if hoping for some sign of approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena simply arched a brow. a thin, cold smile tugging at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pressure built. Clarissa&#39;s voice wavered. &#34;Please believe me. I did what I thought was best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp tappng echoed through the silence as Verena drummed her pen against the table, each click a reminder of who held the power in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the silence stretch, and then replied in a tone that brooked no argument, &#34;Ms. Guzman, your story is interesting, but the facts will come out once we conduct a proper audit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile lingered, cold and controlled.&#34;I suggest you make sure there&#39;s nothing in those records that&#39;ll cause trouble. Company policy doesn&#39;t play favorites.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clarissa&#39;s features tightened, and she tried to hide her nerves by adjusting her hair. &#34;Yes, of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, no one dared make a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena let her eyes sweep the room at a measured  pace before settling squarely on the bald man with his head lowered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Platt Martin, seated across from Clarissa, had barely moved since Verena confronted Jared. He looked like he wanted to disappear entirely, shrinking into his chair as if the table might somehow hide him. The overhead lights only made it worse, casting a sharp glare off the top of his bare scalp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Martin, stop trying to disappear into your chair.Look up and face me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s voice cut through the tension, cold and precise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Platt stiffened, his forced smile twitching into something almost comical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look nervous, Mr. Martin,&#34; said Verena, eyes narrowing with a hint of dry amusement. &#34;Should I be asking what you&#39;re so eager to hide? Are you worried I&#39;ll find the same skeletons in your closet as I did with Jared and Clarissa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat broke out across Platt&#39;s forehead. His handkerchief worked overtime as he darted anxious glances toward Molly, hoping for help she never offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not giving him a second to collect himself, Verena added, &#34;Your department controls the company&#39;s  purchase plans, but our records show you&#39;ve been approving raw material purchases almost thirty percent above standard market rates.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rose from her seat, pulled out a thick folder, and laid a report on the table for all to see. &#34;We&#39;re not talking pocket change. These numbers eat into our bottom line. As the head of purchasing, I think everyone here deserves to hear how you plan to explain this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in, she locked eyes with Platt, her voice sharp and direct. &#34;Let&#39;s not forget-word is,you&#39;ve been spending quite a bit of time with certain suppliers at private clubs and luxury venues. Are you going to tell us there&#39;s no connection between those cozy get-togethers and our growing losses?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every accusation landed clean, each sentence hammering home her point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Platt&#39;s composure crumbled. Sweat dripped down his face,his mouth opening and closing in silent panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever excuse he&#39;d hoped to give got stuck in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena watched him struggle, her eyes flashing with contempt. The Kirk family&#39;s so-called loyalists couldn&#39;t withstand real scrutiny for a minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her chin lifted, she looked down at him and marked, &#34;Since you have nothing to say right now take a leave of absence. When you&#39;re ready to give me a real answer, then we&#39;ll talk.&#34;</p>
