                <p>Isaac&#39;s phone suddenly rang, breaking the awkward tension,and he picked it up at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the receiver came the respectful tone of his assistant, Jacob Howard. &#34;Mr. Bennett, I&#39;m already outside the hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s reply was calm and measured. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll be down shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, he turned toward Verena. &#34;I&#39;m heading to work now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lips curved in a gentle smile. &#34;Of course.Have a great day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac rolled his wheelchair toward the door, yet just as he was about to leave, Verena&#39;s soft voice stopped him. &#34;Hold on a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused and turned, catching sight of Verena walking over. She lowered herself to crouch in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to ask what was wrong when she carefully lifted his tie and dabbed at it with a paper napkin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did he notice the corner of his navy tie had been touched by water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze fell on her intent expression, and his dark eyes brimmed with a feeling he could neither name nor deny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to him, she always caught the smallest of details, things even he overlooked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All set.&#34; Verena&#39;s smile bloomed, pulling Isaac back from his thoughts as his eyes rested on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she straightened his slightly rumpled tie, her voice softened like a spring breeze. &#34;No matter how busy work gets, promise me you&#39;ll take care of yourself.Rest when you&#39;re tired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were clear as glass, filled with a warmth that seemed to seep into his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting instant, the scene resembled that of a wife sending her husband off to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyelashes quivered; his heartbeat leapt against his ribs, quick and unsteady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, he had to admit one truth: he was deeply touched. &#34;Mr. Bennett, there&#39;s a document for you to review.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time lsaac gatheed his wandering thoughts, he was already seated in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the storm in his chest had not calmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at the file Jacob held out from the front seat,but did not take it. Instead, his voice was low and steady. &#34;Head to Willis Villa first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver inclined his head. &#34;Yes, sir.&#34; Then the wheel turned,altering their course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob quietly put the document away. But as he shifted, his eyes caught the sight of Isaac&#39;s tie-slightly crumpled, the corner dampened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked, startled. In the past, Isaac never tolerated even the slightest trace of disarray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had something shifted since last night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob remembered waiting nearly half an hour at the hotel entrance, only for lsaac to call and instruct him to return home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jacob.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing his name, Jacob straightened immediately &#34;Mr. Bennett, what can I do for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac held his phone, lips pressed thin, his gaze lowered. &#34;Next time Verena calls, no matter how busy I am,bring the phone to me at once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob froze for a beat, and then nodded quickly.&#34;Understood, Mr. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, he wondered if his eyes had deceived him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Isaac...smiling?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard to believe, not because he never smiled,but because the warmth in it resembled a man hopelessly in love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pulled up Verena&#39;s number in his contacts, edited it, and pinned it at the very top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car drew to a halt outside Willis Villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Bennett, would you like me to announce your arrival first?&#34; Jacob asked cautiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes narrowed on the villa gates, his brows knitting. His reply was cold as steel. &#34;Unnecessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the Willis family, empty formalities were not required.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob nodded. &#34;Alright.&#34; Then he moved to wheel Isaac forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that hour, Alec had just finished breakfast and was preparing to leave for the office, while Laura,Kaia,and Luka were making their way downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first to spot lsaac was Alec, who had just reached the living room entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flickered in his eyes, but he quickly approached with a smile. &#34;Mr. Bennett, when did you arrive? If you had told us earlier, we would have prepared coffee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura and Kaia exchanged a quick glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,Laura rushed over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia,regretting her choice of pajamas, wished she had dressed better.Straightening her hair, she followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Luka remained at the table, eating his breakfast leisurely, his demeanor of a spoiled heir untouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had heard that Verena left home yesterday, and the news secretly pleased him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Isaac. Please sit!&#34; Laura&#39;s smile was warm as she barked an order at the servant. &#34;Don&#39;t just stand there-bring our finest coffee...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t bother,&#34; Isaac interrupted, his tone flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where others plastered on smiles, his face remained unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though seated in a wheelchair, the air around him was as commanding as a general on the battlefield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing something amiss, Alec&#39;s smile faltered.&#34;Mr.Bennett, is there something you wish to discuss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His first thought was Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is indeed,&#34; Isaac answered. &#34;It concerns my fiancée.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Willis family exchanged startled glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura frowned, suspicion rising. &#34;Isaac, what do you mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze lifted to her, a cold gleam flickering beneath his lashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under that look, Laura&#39;s eyelids twitched, and a shiver ran down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac,why are you staring at me like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips curved faintly, yet the smile carried an edge.&#34;I&#39;m simply curious how you managed to drive my fiancée out of her own home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile might have been polite, but the weight behind it pressed like a storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s heart froze-he was here for Verena</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec thought bitterly that he should have foreseen Verena would bring Isaac into this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned at her lack of restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what mattered now was calming Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, the truth is, Verena was just...&#34; Alec was cut off by Laura, who shifted her tone to disdain. &#34;So what if she was driven out? A daughter bold enough to challenge her own mother hardly deserves a place at home. Don&#39;t worry, lsaac. I only asked her to stay outside for a while. She&#39;ll return before the wedding.She grew up in a small village, accustomed to a carefree life. Without proper discipline, she&#39;ll only bring trouble to the Bennett family in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura spoke as though even allowing Verena back was a gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec&#39;s face flushed crimson with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Foolish woman!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with Isaac present, he could not let his anger show. Isaac did not so much as glance at her. His voice was steady, his words striking like thunder. &#34;You may see Verena as unimportant, but to me, she is one of a kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The declaration left the Willis family dumbstruck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They knew all too well who lsaac was, the brightest heir of the Bennett family in Shoildon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with his legs paralyzed, his shares and influence stood unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one had imagined he would speak with such sincerity, such unmistakable affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the table, Luka finally set down his glass after gulping milk, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never expected his eldest sister&#39;s charm to run so deep-deep enough to rattle Isaac himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had truly turned the tide.</p>
