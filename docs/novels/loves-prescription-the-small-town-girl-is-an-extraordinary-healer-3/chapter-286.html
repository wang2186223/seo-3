                <p>Verena glanced over and saw the dining table already laid out, dishes steaming and fragrant, the aromas alone promising how mouthwatering they must taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight caught her off guard, and sheturned to Isaac in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Isaac lifted his gaze. Warmth flickered in his eyes as he spoke softly. &#34;I figured you hadn&#39;t eaten much since you left this morning, so I had everything prepared ahead of time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle heat rose within Verena&#39;s chest, melting away her earlier exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved into a smile, her eyes sparkling as she said, &#34;Come, join me for the meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They soon sat facing each other at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With practiced ease, Isaac&#39;s long fingers portioned the cod. Without lifting his eyes, he asked calmly,&#34;IVan seemed quite on edge earlier. The one in the operating room must be someone very close to him, isn&#39;t that right?&#34; Verena accepted the piece of tender fish he served her, nodding slowly as she ate. &#34;Luciana and Ivan have been childhood companions, tied together since they were small. Ivan has always carried feelings for her,but with Luciana&#39;s family now so well-off, he feels unworthy. That&#39;s why, all these years, he never dared to tell her how he feels.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sigh slipped out, tinged with pity at the tangled fate of the two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She failed to notice the way Isaac&#39;s skilled hands froze ever so slightly at her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her explanation, his doubts dissolved completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So it wasn&#39;t what he had imagined after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl Ivan loved was someone else-meaning Ivan was not Verena&#39;s first love. A new question stirred within Isaac: if not Ivan, then who occupied the hidden corner of Verena&#39;s heart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts drifted, though he kept them buried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the blink of an eye, Isaac returned to his usual composure. His hands moved again to cut the fish, his face carrying the same gentle smile as though that flicker of unease had never been there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Verena was still deep in sleep when the sharp ring of the phone pierced the quiet,waking her abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the hospital. The moment she answered, Huxley&#39;s urgent voice rang out. &#34;Evelyn, the patient has regained consciousness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, sleep vanished from her eyes. She rose quickly. &#34;Alright, I understand. I&#39;ll be there immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressing in haste, she rushed to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corridors reeked faintly of disinfectant as she strode briskly into Luciana&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan sat at the bedside, his gaze never leaving Luciana as he murmured softly to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant he saw Verena, he jumped to his feet, a smile breaking across his tired face. &#34;Verena!&#34; he called. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, bruised with fatigue, proof that sleep had abandoned him through the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now that Luciana had woken, the heaviness on his heart seemed lifted, and he looked more spirited than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed through Verena as she teased lightly, &#34;The patient needs peace and quiet. If you keep shouting,I&#39;ll throw you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan instantly mimed zipping his lips shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luciana, lying in bed, was amused. Verena moved closer, her voice gentle. &#34;How are you feeling?&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luciana&#39;s face was delicate and small, but her eyes-bright and lively like two clear jewels-were impossible to miss. Though her head was wrapped in bandages, her natural charm shone undiminished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled faintly,gratitude gleaming in her eyes. &#34;I&#39;m alright. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave a small nod, and then began a meticulous examination, her hands steady, her movements practiced and light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, test results arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reviewed them all with care, and only when everything confirmed Luciana&#39;s safety did she let out a long,quiet breath, relief spreading into a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan too felt a crushing weight lift from his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning serious, Verena explained the follow-up care to the other doctors, her tone firm, reminding them every detail required utmost attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When all was arranged, she turned to Ivan. &#34;I&#39;ll leave her in their capable hands for now. Look after her well,and reach out if anything comes up. For the time being, Isaac and I must return to Shoildon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan nodded quickly, his eyes brimming with gratitude. His voice, hoarse from sleepless nights and brimming emotion, carried a rough edge. &#34;Verena, thank you... If you hadn&#39;t rushed here without hesitation and performed surgery on Luciana, I don&#39;t dare imagine the outcome.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head lowered slightly, as if embarrassed by the sheer weight of his thanks. His fingers fiddled with his shirt hem like a child caught between guilt and gratitude. &#34;I truly owe you more than words can say. As I promised before-just give the word, and I&#39;ll do anything for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s smile softened. Seeing his earnestness, she teased gently, &#34;That&#39;s quite the oath. You&#39;re making me feel a little burdened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped closer, giving his shoulder a light pat. &#34;No need for grand vows. Let&#39;s settle the debt with the meal I promised you earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan instantly grasped what she meant-she wanted to ease his sense of obligation and not trap him under the weight of a favor. That realization warmed his heart. Quietly, he swore he would protect this woman always, a bond even deeper than family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, the plane gathered speed on the runway, lifting smoothly into the skies. Inside the cabin, calm and comfort wrapped around the passengers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena and Isaac sat side by side, the window framing a boundless sea of clouds, sunlight gilding them in molten gold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to him, Verena finally shared, &#34;The issue with Simon is settled. I didn&#39;t get a chance to tell you yesterday. The information you got is correct. His true name is Carl Aguilar. I saved him back in Clokron nothing more than a gesture of compassion, trying to pull him back from death&#39;s edge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow knitted, anger flashing across her face. &#34;But I never imagined he would twist those feelings into obsession-so warped he would murder my grandmother, aIl just to claim me for himself.&#34;</p>
