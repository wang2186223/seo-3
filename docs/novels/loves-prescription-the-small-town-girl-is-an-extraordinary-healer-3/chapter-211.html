                <p>Verena knew Isaac said that because he was worried about her health, yet she couldn&#39;t bear to let him wait any longer. Besides, in the early days of her pregnancy, nothing would be greatly affected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With resolve glimmering in her eyes, she declared,&#39;&#34;No, your surgery must be done tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac parted his lips, wanting to argue, but before words could leave him, Verena softened her tone and continued, &#34;Isaac, I know myself better than anyone. You don&#39;t have to worry about me. You&#39;ve waited long enough-this is your moment. The surgery cannot be delayed a single day more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was gentle, yet firm as iron wrapped in silk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am a doctor. I know what is best for my patients, and what you need most right now is that surgery. You must regain your health.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her hand slowly, letting her palm rest on his cheek in a tender caress. &#34;Trust me. My team and I are fully prepared. I promise I&#39;ll protect both myself and the baby before I even touch the scalpel.Alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth of her palm seemed to sweep away the storms in Isaac&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long silence, he nodded faintly. &#34;Alright, then the surgery will be tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, when news spread that lsaac would undergo surgery, not only Danica and Bobby,but his close friends also rushed to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corridor was thick with tension, yet beneath it ran a current of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cayden,Stevie, and Leonardo sat on the benches, eyes fixed upon the glowing sign above the operating room door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s face was drawn tight with worry, her hands clasped before her chest. Sometimes she closed her eyes to whisper silent prayers; sometimes she looked toward the door as though it might open any moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She trusted Verena&#39;s skills, yet anxiety still gnawed at her heart. She also knew Verena bore a double burden: operating while carrying new life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gratitude welled up in her chest like a tide she could not hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her, Bobby stood stiffly, his hands pressed against his hips, lips locked into a straight line. Sweat beaded on his forehead though the corridor was cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his wrist again and again, checking his watch for what felt like the hundredth time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s already been three hours,&#34; he muttered, anxiety creeping into his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every minute outside the operating room dragged like an hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faces grew solemn, eyes flickering again and again toward the tightly sealed doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the operating room, all of Verena&#39;s focus was on Isaac, lying under the bright lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, her hands had trembled at the mere touch of a scalpel after her grandmother&#39;s death,yet now they moved with the steadiness of stone, every cut and stitch precise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no room for fear, no room for hesitation-only the unshakable thought that Isaac must make it through. The operating lamps shone harsh and white, the occasional clash of instruments echoing in the stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat beaded on Verena&#39;s forehead, and Julianna swiftly dabbed it away with a towel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clamp,&#34; Verena ordered, her voice crisp and unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julianna responded at once, placing the instrument in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The operation stretched past four hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When at last the lights dimmed and Verena stepped out, weary yet upright, everyone surged toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s voice trembled between hope and dread. &#34;Verena, how is Isaac?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes fixed on her-Bobby&#39;s, Cayden&#39;s, Stevie&#39;s, Leonardo&#39;s. A faint smile curved Verena&#39;s lips. &#34;The surgery was a success. Don&#39;t worry. With proper care, his recovery will be steady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A collective sigh of relief broke through the corridor like a dam giving way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s eyes filled with tears as she clasped Verena&#39;s hands. &#34;Thank you, Verena. Without you, Isaac might have been bound to a wheelchair forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby&#39;s voice cracked as he brushed at the corners of his eyes. &#34;Verena, it&#39;s a blessing you are here.When my brother wakes and learns he can soon stand tall again, he&#39;ll be overjoyed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cayden,himself a doctor, understood the weight of what Verena had carried, especially with her pregnancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His respect deepened as he spoke. &#34;You need to rest. Hours on your feet-it must have taken so much out of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stevie added quickly, &#34;Yes, Verena, you can&#39;t overexert yourself. Think of the baby too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonardo nodded solemnly. &#34;That&#39;s right. Rest now-we&#39;ll let you know the moment Isaac wakes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena hesitated, unwilling to leave Isaac&#39;s side, but Danica gently took her hand. Her voice was soft, yet full of motherly concern. &#34;Go and rest for a while. You&#39;ve carried out such a long surgery. I&#39;ll stay here and call you the moment he opens his eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking into Danica&#39;s earnest gaze, Verena finally relented andnodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surrounded by so many who cared, she could at last let herself pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three hours later, Bobby pushed open the lounge door. &#34;Verena, my brother&#39;s awake. He says he wants to see you.&#34;	b</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena rose at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the ward entrance, Julianna hurried forward with a report. &#34;Evelyn, his heart rate,blood pressure, and all other vitals have returned to normal. He is conscious, no complications.&#34; Verena nodded with quiet relief. &#34;Good. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lay in the bed, his eyes filled with tenderness as they followed her every step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time after the accident, he felt he might truly stand by her side like any other man-able to hold,protect, and embrace her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it really possible?&#34; His voice quivered, half question, half prayer.&#34;Can I truly recover fully... walk again like before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena sat beside him, her smile calm and reassuring. &#34;Your body indicators are all normal. Don&#39;t worry.Once the surgical wounds heal, we&#39;ll begin rehabilitation. For now, you must rest and let time do its work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned forward to check the monitors carefully, and then kissed his forehead with quiet affection.&#34;Believe me, you will recover well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes reddened as emotion surged through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips trembled, his voice hoarse yet filled with devotion. &#34;Verena... thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, he vowed silently to give his all in recovery, to waste none of her sacrifice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing he needed rest, Verena stayed a little longer before stepping outside. Julianna approached swiftly. &#34;Evelyn, there&#39;s something I need to report.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Verena asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our medical team is large, but many remain abroad. With the hospital now open and your name carrying weight, patients flood in daily. Yet our staff is too few-both doctors and nurses are stretched thin. We cannot sustain this pace unless tive recruit quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave a thoughtful nod. &#34;You&#39;re right. We need.more hands urgently. Handle the arrangements,butl want to personally review the final interviews.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julianna inclined her head. &#34;Understood. I&#39;ll begin right away.&#34;</p>
