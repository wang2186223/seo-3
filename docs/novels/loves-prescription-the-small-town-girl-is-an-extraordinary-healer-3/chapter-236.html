                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the outcome? I thought Simon was only interested in men,&#34; said Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s brow creased as he met her eyes. &#34;That&#39;s what everyone who knows him believed, but Slater&#39;s little experiment told a different story. Simon barely reacted. If anything,he looked repulsed. I checked his background before all this, and I&#39;m sure Slater is his type. If Simon really fit the profile, he should have shown at least a spark of interest. But there was nothing. Actually, it was the complete opposite. He even recoiled from the whole situation. And then there&#39;s his supposed obsession with cleanliness-turns out,he lives off takeout and lets the trash pile up for days. That doesn&#39;t line up with anything in our records.The Simon you see now is nothing like the Simon I investigated. It&#39;s almost as if we&#39;re dealing with two separate people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stared at him,bewildered. &#34;Are you telling me the Simon working at the hospital isn&#39;t even the same person as the one from your investigation reports?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t questioning Isaac&#39;s instincts-just struggling to make sense of it all. &#34;I read through every part of his resume when we hired him. It was flawless. The authorities checked his background,and no one found the smallest problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, nothing added up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could someone just switch identities like that?Even with plastic surgery, you can&#39;t just copy a person down to the last detail. And what&#39;s more, how did he get through all our background checks without leaving a trace? What is he really after in my hospital?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her questions hung in the air, and the tension grew thicker by the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to steady her breathing, but a chill crept up her spine, as if she were standing at the center of a mystery she couldn&#39;t escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac met her gaze, every word measured. &#34;He&#39;s here because of you, Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disbelief clouded her eyes as she struggled to accept it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;ve never even spoken to him before,&#34; she said,her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac studied her. &#34;You say you never met him, but are you certain he wasn&#39;t watching you all along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena pressed her teeth gently to her bottom lip, deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions spun through her mind. She wondered if Simon had been playing a much bigger game all along,slipping into the hospital with his own secret motives.Still, one thing never wavered-her faith in Isaac remained unshakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If there was even a chance Simon was hiding something,she refused to sit by and do nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new resolve filled her eyes as she finally broke the silence. &#34;I&#39;ll figure out a way to get close to Simon. If he&#39;s not who he claims to be, I want to see how he pulled off such a perfect imitation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A darker look passed over Isaac&#39;s face, and he met her determination with a slow nod. &#34;Okay. Just watch yourself,all right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint crease formed on Verena&#39;s brow as her mind wandered to another possibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, the name Carl floated to the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, she let herself consider every wild theory she&#39;d tried to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if Simon and Carl were one and the same? The timing fit. Carl had vanished. There was a possibility he had slipped into Simon&#39;s identity while the real Simon was...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was the real Simon being held somewhere? Or had something worse happened to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena massaged her temples, eyes fixed on the world slipping by outside the car window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Streetlights and shadows flashed past, and for a moment, it seemed like danger itself was moving just out of sight, waiting for its chance to close in.</p>
