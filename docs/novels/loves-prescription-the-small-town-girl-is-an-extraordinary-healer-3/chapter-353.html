                <p>Isaac and Verena lingered in each other&#39;s arms,holding on for a few quiet moments. Eventually, she leaned back and fixed Isaac with a steady, urgent look.&#34;I&#39;ve been meaning to tell you something important,but I haven&#39;t found the right moment until now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle touch, Isaac brushed her hair back, his voice soft and encouraging. &#34;Tell me, Verena.Whatever it is, I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brows knitted together, Verena took a breath and spoke with care. &#34;The other day at Sherwood&#39;s place,I noticed his dog darting out of a room carrying something.The dog stopped right at my feet, and when a servant finally left with the dog,I realized there was a necklace lying on the floor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, she hesitated, swallowing hard as if the memory stung. &#34;I picked it up for a closer look and saw letters carved into the pendant. Luis told me once that my parents designed a special necklace for me when I was born. I recognized it straight away. It was definitely the one they made. But what I can&#39;t figure out is how it ended up at Sherwood&#39;s house.Something about it makes me think my disappearance all those years ago is tiedto him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration and confusion clouded her eyes as she tried to make sense of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac took in every word. The tenderness on his face faded,replaced by a chilling resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He squeezed her hand and his tone dropped, steady and unshakable. &#34;You can count on me, Verena. I&#39;m not going to let this go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze sharpened, steel in his voice. &#34;It doesn&#39;t add up-Sherwood having the necklace your parents gave you, and no explanation for it. I&#39;ll turn over every stone, call in every favor I have, until we know the truth. If anyone has been trying to hurt you or your family,they&#39;re going to regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Isaac spoke, he reached up and gently eased the tension from Verena&#39;s brow, as if worried she might shatter under too much weight. &#34;You don&#39;t have to shoulder this alone, Verena. I&#39;m right here. When we finally get to the bottom of everything,I&#39;ll make sure you and your parents receive the justice you deserve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved into a small smile as she gave a little nod, but then a thought seemed to strike her. &#34;I should head home and change my clothes. There are a few things at the office I need to sort out.&#34; Isaac&#39;s brow creased as concern flashed in his eyes.&#34;You just went through a lot, Verena. And you&#39;re still not back to full strength. Can&#39;t you rest for a dayor two? Work will stilI be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a light laugh, Verena glanced up at him and gave his hand a reassuring pat. &#34;I appreciate how much you care. I really do. But there are issues at work that only I can fix. I&#39;ll feel better once I&#39;ve handled them myself.Honestly, I&#39;m feeling fine. I just want to change clothes and get everything settled at the office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a quiet sigh, realizing there was no point in arguing with her when she had her mind made up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gently, he cupped her cheeks in his hands, his thumb tracing soothing circles against her skin. &#34;Okay, I&#39;ll come with you. At least let me help you get home and change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, the doctor arrived with equipment for a detailed checkup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the exam was over, the doctor addressed Isaac directly. &#34;She&#39;s still in a delicate state and needs lots of rest. Make sure her meals are balanced and full of nutrients, especially vitamins and minerals. Cut down on anything spicy or oily. Try to keep her stress-free,physically and emotionally-that&#39;s important for both her and the baby. And if anything at all seems off,don&#39;t hesitate to bring her straight to the hospital.&#34; Isaac gave the doctor a grateful nod, silently promising to remember every detail. &#34;Thanks for letting us know. I&#39;ll do everything you suggested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they had the approval to leave, lsaac helped Verena up, made sure she looked comfortable, and led her out of the hospital together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car rolled closer to Sampson Villa, Verena leaned in, her voice low and careful. &#34;Let&#39;s not talk about last night with my parents when we get home,Isaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at her, picking up on the graveness in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drew in a steady breath. &#34;Dad&#39;s getting on in years,and he worries about the smallest things at home.I don&#39;t want Mom feeling anxious, either. If they find out I was at the hospital because of stomach pain,it&#39;ll just make them worry even more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His answer was firm, his mouth set in a line. &#34;Alright,we&#39;ll keep it to ourselves. You&#39;re the only thing that matters right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time they arrived, the house was quiet.Joseph and Marisa were still in their bedroom, and Luis was probably out jogging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena and Isaac slipped upstairs, changed into fresh  clothes, and straightened up a bit before heading down to join the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smell of breakfast drifted through the house,greeting them as they stepped into the dining room where Joseph and Marisa were already seated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marisa looked distant, her thoughts elsewhere as she stared at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph, ever patient, leaned closer,softly talking her through something as he offered her a piece of bread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without really noticing, Marisa took a bite, but her gaze remained lost, as if she was searching for an answer that never quite arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph noticed Marisa&#39;s confusion and patiently scooped up some cereal, blowing on it to cool before gently coaxing her to take another bite. Whatever he whispered seemed to smooth the worry from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marisa&#39;s gaze wandered, and then suddenly caught sight of Verena and Isaac descending the stairs. Light came into her eyes, transforming her whole face with a bright, childlike joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waving both hands, she called out, &#34;Come on, let&#39;s eat together!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph, hearing her cheerful voice, looked up automatically. His warm, familiar smile greeted Isaac &#34;Isaac, you made it! Grab a seat and join us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned his attention back to Marisa, gently helping her with another spoonful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Joseph stayed focused on Marisa-then it hit him. His eyes snapped back to lsaac,disbelief washing over his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait-Isaac, you&#39;re standing? Is that really you?&#34; The surprise lifted his voice higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marisa didn&#39;t quite grasp the details, but the excitement in the room caught on. Her blank expression broke into pure delight. She clapped and cheered, &#34;Yay,yay!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a laugh, Joseph set the bowl and spoon aside and stood, excitement radiating from him. &#34;Verena,Isaac-how did this happen? Why didn&#39;t you tell us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, still holding Verena&#39;s hand, walked over with a wide grin. &#34;Once Verena started helping me, I never missed a day of rehab. Yesterday, I finally realized I could get around on my own. I wanted her to be the first to know, so I came straight to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena squeezed his hand, nodding as she looked at Joseph. &#34;Dad, he came by late last night, but you and Mom were already asleep. We didn&#39;t want to wake you with the news.&#34;</p>
