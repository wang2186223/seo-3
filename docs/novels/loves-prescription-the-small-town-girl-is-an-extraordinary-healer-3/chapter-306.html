                <p>Upon hearing those words,Isaac&#39;s heart tightened with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afraid that Verena might stumble and hurt herself,he clenched his teeth, his hand gripping the sofa&#39;s armrest as though anchoring himself. Veins stood out on his forehead as he forced his weary body to respond.Summoning every ounce of strength left in him,he tried to rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, after a grueling struggle, his legs quivered but managed to lift him upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, the moment he tried to take a step toward Verena,his body betrayed him. His legs felt like dead weight, each movement agonizing, his frame swaying like a reed in the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena rushed forward, catching his arm before he collapsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his balance steadied, she gently let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her gaze to him, her eyes brimmed with joy.&#34;You&#39;re standing now, aren&#39;t you? Isaac,you really can do it.&#34; Only then did Isaac look down, as though waking from a dream, to see his legs planted firmly on the floor-supporting him without crutch or aid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, it was under his own willpower that he truly stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of triumph lit his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena,I stood up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes grew moist. He opened his mouth, but emotion rose like a knot in his throat, silencing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, he managed to choke out the words.&#34;I ...I really stood up...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried disbelief, yet it trembled with an irrepressible joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s heart swelled with mixed feelings. She almost wanted to weep. Reaching up,she wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes, her smile tender.&#34;Yes, Isaac, you did it. I knew you could. If you keep trying,you&#39;ll walk freely again,just like before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac nodded with fierce determination, his arms wrapping around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He buried his head against her shoulder, his voice hushed and uneven. &#34;Verena, thank you... thank you for giving me the courage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten days slipped by in the blink of an eye, and the Sampson family party arrived as promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The party unfolded within a stately mansion in Ochrerayd. Paths of polished bluestone led the way,flanked by white walls etched with intricate patterns -each detail bearing the mark of fine craftsmanship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the garden&#39;s heart lay a petite pond,clear as glass,its surface shimmering under the touch of the setting sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following the corridor to its far end opened into the party&#39;s main hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The contrast struck at once. Where the exterior exuded rustic calm, the interior dazzled with grandeur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tables draped in luxurious cloths stood in precise order, each adorned with gleaming dinnerware and bright blossoms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Candles flickered, their flames mingling with the brilliance of crystal chandeliers above, bathing the hall in a glow that was both warm and regal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The parking lot of the mansion teemed with commotion. Vehicles lined up in neat succession, headlights glinting like jewels in the twilight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each polished car seemed to declare the prestige of its passenger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One after another, distinguished guests stepped out.Titans of business adjusted their suits, their conversations hushed but brimming with speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Politicians, faces practiced into perfect smiles,walked with poise toward the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd also included men from the city&#39;s undercurrents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their presence brought an unusual vibe, slightly out of sync with the surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their sharp gazes and hardened faces betrayed lives carved by survival, yet tonight even they set aside arrogance, carrying themselves with uncharacteristic restraint before the Sampson family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adding to the atmosphere were journalists from every corner of the media, their cameras and microphones at the ready to capture history in the making.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long crimson carpet unfurled from the garden to the hall, flanked by servers who stood like sentinels,their polite smiles rehearsed to perfection. At the entrance to the main hall, Verena and Luis stood ready to greet the guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The occasion demanded dignity, and Verena chose a designer dress. Its pristine fabric gleamed faintly,embroidered with delicate patterns. The cut was elegant yet considerate, allowing space for the child she carried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she moved, the sleeves swayed lightly, like petals stirred by a gentle breeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her makeup was simple but refined. Her long hair was coiled neatly and secured with a hairpin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grace of her slender neck and poised bearing gave her an aura both serene and noble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her stood Luis, tall and steadfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tailored black suit bespoke craftsmanship of the highest tier. A crisp white shirt and dark-patterned tie completed the look,exuding quiet dignity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hair was neatly combed, his eyes clear and sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together,they presented a striking contrast-softness and steel side by side-drawing admiration from all who passed. Many whispered their praise of their presence and natural poise. Luis, ever mindful, introduced guests to Verena while discreetly sharing with her the intricacies of Ochrerayd&#39;s social currents. Each introduction was a thread,weaving her into the fabric of her new life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a middle-aged man in a navy suit and gold -rimmed glasses approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Luis, he quickened his step, extending his hand warmly. &#34;Mr. Sampson, it&#39;s been too long. I heard your sister has been found-what wonderful news! After hardship always comes blessing. Your family is destined to rise higher than ever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a slight bow, humility laced into his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; lips curved faintly as he returned the handshake.His words were steady,carrying the composure of one accustomed to command. &#34;Thank you for your kind words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning with quiet pride, Luis gestured toward Verena.&#34;Mr. Dury, allow me to introduce my younger sister,Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice softened with warmth as he continued,&#34;Verena, this is Henrik Dury of the Dury Group. In Ochrerayd&#39;s high-tech sector, his company holds weight,andtheirproductshaveearnednotableacclaim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning closer, Luis whispered to her, &#34;Their influence  doesn&#39;t rival the largest groups, but their strength in research and development makes them invaluable.One day, when we step into this field, Henrik will be an important ally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding, Verena smiled graciously. She bowed slightly. &#34;Mr. Dury, I&#39;ve heard much about you. It&#39;s an honor to meet you today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henrik&#39;s gaze lingered a moment, admiration flickering in his eyes. Something about her seemed familiar,though the memory eluded him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With practiced courtesy, he replied, &#34;Ms. Sampson,you&#39;re too generous. Your return has already added new color to Ochrerayd. I look forward to future collaborations with you and Mr. Sampson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, an attendant guided Henrik into the hall,leaving the air warm with anticipation for what was yet to unfold.</p>
