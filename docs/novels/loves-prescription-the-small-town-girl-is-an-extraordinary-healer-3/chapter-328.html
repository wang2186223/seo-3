                <p>As time went by, under Verena&#39;s patient guidance,Isaac slowly learned to catch the rhythm of walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She supported him with steady arms,softly counting,&#34;One,two,one,two...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matching her cadence, Isaac adjusted his steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bit by bit, his movements grew steadier. They still carried a tremor, but no longer the helpless wobble of the beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Step after step-each as heavy as climbing a mountain,each demanding most of Verena&#39;s strength to keep him upright-yet at least he was finally able to summon his own willpower and press forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him push against his limits, Verena couldn&#39;t hold back her praise. &#34;I knew you&#39;d manage. Look how far you&#39;ve come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her support, Isaac had already covered a surprising distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering his gaze, he noticed the strain in her slender arms, veins rising faintly against her skin, and beads of  sweat glistening on her smooth forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pang of heartache stirred within him. He gently clasped her delicate arm, his breath uneven, and said,&#34;That&#39;s enough for today. Let&#39;s take a break.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded with a smile. &#34;Alright, let&#39;s rest for a while. You must be exhausted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She guided him carefully to the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once seated,she poured him a glass of water,passing it to him with quiet insistence. &#34;Here, drik.You need to replenish your strength.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a sip from her own glass, and then said warmly, &#34;Isaac, at the pace you&#39;re recovering,your legs will heal completely. Walking as you once did is only a matter of time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting down her glass, she turned slightly,unable to hide her joy. &#34;Just think-in such a short while, you&#39;ve already managed to walk with your own strength.The speed of your progress is remarkable. If we keep to this rhythm, together with the healing methods we&#39;re using, it won&#39;t be long before you can walk, even run,freely again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walk...run...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words he once shunned, words he dared not hope for. But now...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lifted his eyes, filled with longing, and gazed at Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes glimmered with a soft radiance, her smile so tender that he wished to shield it for life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That gaze of hers struck the most fragile corner of his heart, as if it carried a spell only she could weave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Love surged through him. He quickly set his glass aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the next breath, he wrapped his strong arms around her waist, drawing her close as though he were cradling the most precious treasure on earth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his head, pressing his cheek gently against her rounded belly, feeling the warmth and faint pulse of life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that embrace, words became unnecessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing his eyes, lsaac let the quiet warmth soak through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This-this was the home he had longed for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her by his side, with their love&#39;s creation within her,the shadow of pain and despair dissolved like mist at sunrise. Drawing in a deep breath of her familiar scent, he whispered, &#34;Verena, thank you... for all of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart swelled at the sight of him. Love filled her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She combed her fingers through his hair,bent low,and murmured near his ear, &#34;Isaac, from here on, things will only get better for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac smiled faintly, nuzzling against her waist in quiet reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a thought crossed Verena&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved into a playful smile, her voice carrying a note of gossip. &#34;I can&#39;t help wondering what will become of Luis and Miranda. Do you think they&#39;ll last?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words stirred a spark of jealousy in Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been resting contentedly against her belly, but now he lifted his head, feigning a pout as he leaned so close their faces nearly touched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half-playful, half-complaining, he said, &#34;Instead of worrying about Luis&#39; tangled romance, shouldn&#39;t you be more concerned with our love story?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze fell on her lips, holding her there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena caught the glimmer of desire rising in his eyes His playful and jealous demeanor reminded her of the times they spent together in Clokron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of this, she smiled tenderly and leaned in to kiss him...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Sherwood, Venera knew action could not be delayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, she instructed her assistant to book the earliest flight to Ochrerayd for the following morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When dawn had yet to break and the city lay in slumber, she left with her portable laptop in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the airport, she moved through check-in and security with quiet determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plane took off, piercing the clouds, and a few hours later descended smoothly onto Ochrerayd&#39;s runway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While waiting earlier, she had already contacted the Sampson family driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So the moment she stepped out of the terminal, she spotted the familiar black vehicle waiting at its designated spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver, neatly uniformed, had clearly been there  for some time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her surprise, one of Luis&#39; assistants was also present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon seeing her, the driver quickly stepped forward,respectfully opening the rear door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded in acknowledgment and slipped gracefully into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door closed with a soft click, and the car eased onto the main road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated in the back, Verena furrowed her brow slightly,turning over in her mind the matters she would soon discuss with Luis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers tapped lightly on the window frame before she asked the assistant, &#34;Patrick,is Luis busy right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked because she didn&#39;t wish to stumble into another awkward scene-charming though it might have seemed the first time, she had no desire to witnessit again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car rolled to a gentle halt at a red light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick Hayes, sitting in the passenger seat,turned to reply with calm courtesy.&#34;When Mr.Sampson learned of your visit and the importance of your discussion,he moved his morning meetings to the afternoon. He  should be in the office now,awaiting you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing no further questions, Patrick turned back,sitting upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light turned green, and the car resumed its smooth pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, they pulled into Sampson Group&#39;s exclusive underground lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver quickly stepped out to open her door with respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena alighted, straightening her attire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick led her through the first-floor lobby and into the private elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft &#34;ding,&#34; the elevator doors opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped aside, motioning for her to go ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The carpeted hallway carried her to the door of Luis &#39;office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick knocked lightly. At the call of &#34;Come in,&#34; he opened the door and smiled, gesturing for her to enter. Verena stepped inside. Luis, standing by the window,  turned as she entered. &#34;Verena, you&#39;re here. You caught such an early flight-you must be tired. Come,sit and rest a while.&#34;</p>
