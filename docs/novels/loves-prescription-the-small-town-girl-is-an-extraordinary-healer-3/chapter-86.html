                <p>Kaia&#39;s chest rose and fell in sharp bursts, every breath ragged and loud. Fury widened her eyes, and her fists clenched so tight that her nails pierced skin she no longer felt. The fire in her gaze burned far hotter than any pain her body registered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hatred thundered inside her, echoing like a storm without end. Verena&#39;s name pounded through her mind-over and over, relentless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each repetition carried the same venom, as though uttering the name alone could erase Verena from existence. It was always the same. Whenever Verena entered her world, something precious was stolen away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hatred had no limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had stolen their parents&#39; attention with ease. Verena had been the one to heal Barrie&#39;s injured leg.Verena had won Isaac&#39;s affection without even trying, while Kaia had hidden her love for him for years. Why had he given his heart so freely to her rival? And now, Slater&#39;s defense of Verena&#39;s reputation had sealed her humiliation, parading Verena&#39;s brilliance while reducing Kaia to a pitiful joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of helplessness swept over her, and she collapsed onto the bed, clutching the sheets with desperate strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her teeth sank into the inside of her lip, the sting of blood flooding her mouth with bitterness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the rage, her eyes gleamed with a dangerous resolve. She would never surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Verena&#39;s claim to fame was curing Barrie&#39;s leg, so what? Against Evelyn Rowe,the world-renowned medical legend, Verena&#39;s so-called brilliance would crumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell had assured her that when Evelyn arrived at Acorith College of Medicine to give a lecture, a seat would be kept aside with her name on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No price was too high, and no effort too great-Kaia had resolved that she would claim the role of Evelyn&#39;s final apprentice. Once that happened, she would shine across the medical world just as Evelyn had. And really, what did Verena&#39;s degree from Pine Hill University matter then?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bloodshot eyes gleamed with obsession, and Kaia&#39;s lips stretched into a smile that carried nothing but malice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind spun with ambition. Years of training under Evelyn would give her the credentials to pursue a doctorate at PineHill University itself, and the glory of being Evelyn&#39;s chosen student would crush whatever spotlight Verena held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia muttered to herself, &#34;Those mocking me today will kneel and beg for my recognition someday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.-.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac slipped his phone into his pocket after uploading the post.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena guided him into the waiting car. The driver swung the door closed, climbed into his seat, and opened his mouth to ask for directions when Verena spoke first. &#34;Take me back to the hotel, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; the driver replied with quiet respect, turning the wheel as the car eased onto the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the back seat, Isaac&#39;s voice cut through, edged with the faintest irritation. just registered our marriage, and you still want to return to the hotel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone else might have missed the shift in tone, but the driver had worked under him long enough to notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he pulled over and stayed silent, making himself invisible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pressed into the seatback, his eyes settling on Verena. His brow creased, and the hand on his lap tightened into a fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amusement flickered across her face, and a laugh slipped free. That tiny habit of his, clenching his hand whenever anger or frustration stirred, had never left him, not even after losing his memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes narrowed the moment her laugh rang out. To Verena, his look carried a silent protest that said, &#34;We&#39;re already married, and you&#39;re still planning to walk away? Given my state,how could you laugh at me like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her amusement faded quickly as she steadied herself against the seat and leaned in toward him. &#34;The registry gave us papers, yes, but that isn&#39;t a wedding. If I moved into your house right now, it wouldn&#39;t sit right.What would your mother think of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words, full of reason rather than rejection, softened the edge of his mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze dropped, taking in the liveliness of her expression. Almost without thought, he reached up, lifted her chin lightly, and said with a teasing curve of his lips, &#34;So you&#39;re worried about my mom&#39;s opinion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gesture caught heroff guard, leaving her lips parted in brief surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recovering quickly, Verena flashed a sly smile, her eyes glinting with playful charm. &#34;Of course I am.Caring about her means I&#39;m caring about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was bright, the kind of sweetness that tugged at his chest as if daring him not to give in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac fixed his eyes on Verena, the look heavy with curiosity that burned deep. Her playful manner was obvious, carrying the edge of a flirt. Could it be that beneath all the things she held close, there was also a real place in her heart for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization struck him hard, a rush of warmth igniting beneath his calm exterior. She cared about him-enough to care about how his family might see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought amused him, and his eyes gleamed with quiet laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let go of her chin and turned toward the window, pressing his fist lightly to his lips as though that could keep the laugh inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena tilted her head, catching the smile he couldn&#39;t quite hide. With a playful poke at his arm, she said,&#34;Why bother holding it back? If you&#39;re happy, then laugh. Don&#39;t make me drag it out of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips betrayed him, curving upward even as he tried to resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing his throat, Isaac caught her hand before she could poke him again. His voice lowered, tender but firm.&#34;What happens in my home is up to me. No one else gets a say. When you&#39;re with me, don&#39;t waste a thought on my mother or anyone else. Do as you like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a sort silence, his voice shifted. &#34;Forget it. I&#39;ve got a place in the Seraphina Villas. I live there alone.How about coming there with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Traditional expectations never carried much weight for Verena. Since the papers were already signed,sharing a home seemed natural. MMore importantly, she had something planned for him tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her decision came after a moment&#39;s thought. &#34;Alright, but we&#39;Il need to swing by the hotel first. I want to grab mythings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her agree instantly eased the tension in Isaac&#39;s mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; he said with a short nod before turning forward and instructing the driver. &#34;Take us to the hotel first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver acknowledged the order and guided the car smoothly into the traffic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the hotel, Verena packed while the staff gathered her luggage and brought it downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her belongings were simple-a single suitcase and a few pieces of medical equipment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With everything loaded into the trunk, the driver pulled away, steering them toward Seraphina Villas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Located in the finest district of Shoildon, the villa sat quietly apart from the city&#39;s noise, an oasis surrounded by luxury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room carried an understated sense of luxury, and the wide spotless windows, gleaming in the light,revealed the touch of frequent professional care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If something about the place bothers you, let my assistant know. Adjustments can be made anytime,&#34; Isaac said evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena turned back to him with an easy smile. &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary.It already feels perfect to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her expression shifted with sudden curiosity. &#34;Where&#39;s the bathroom?&#34; Isaac pointed casually toward the hall. &#34;Straight ahead, then left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He directed her to the guest bath, assuming she would prefer more space before settlingin fully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small nod, Verena carried a bag toward the bathroom, its contents hidden from his view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alone in the living room, Isaac poured himself a glass of water and drank slowly. Minutes passed in silence,and he finally leaned forward to call out when her voice drifted from behind the bathroom door.&#34;Isaac,come in and take a bath!&#34;</p>
