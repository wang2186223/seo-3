                <p>Isaac froze, his ears filling with the sound of his own heartbeat. Something unfamiliar stirred inside him,sharp enough to crease his brow. It wasn&#39;t anger-more like a restless curiosity about this feeling he couldn&#39;t quite name. Each time he pushed Verena away,his chest only grew heavier, as if his steady logic slipped for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fists tightened as he stared at the curtain drawn tightly in front of him. Without fully thinking it through,he wheeled himself forward, an impulse driving him closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand caught the fabric, and he pulled it aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stood just beyond the opening, her back to him as she adjusted the train of her gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gown&#39;s ribbons spilled loose down her spine,the silk strands falling in graceful disarray that somehow felt both elegant and chaotic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac swallowed hard, his throat working as he forced his eyes away. Still, he moved into the fitting room,stopping only when he was behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly,he lifted his hands to gather the ribbons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gentle tug made Verena think the shop assistant had returned to help her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile curved her lips as she said without glancing back, &#34;Thank you. My fiancé gets embarrassed too easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried a sweetness she didn&#39;t even try to hide, the kind that gave her simple words a note of quiet affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s grip on the ribbons grew firmer. It wasn&#39;t the words themselves-it was how carefully she chose them. She never pointed out his limitations, never said a thing about his chair. Instead, she had simply excused him as shy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac blinked, and then answered quietly, &#34;You&#39;re welcome.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of his voice made V/erena whip around in surprise. &#34;You?&#34;she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warm glow filled her face as her eyes brightened and a sincere smile spread across her lips, soft and unguarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac blinked, his lashes trembling slightly as the weight of his earlier behavior settled in-it struck him  then just how overly sensitive he had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He closed his mouth into a firm line, lifted his eyes to meet Verena&#39;s, and said, &#34;I might be feeling a little shy right now, but there are things we&#39;ll need to adjust to,since we&#39;re going to be married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena hadn&#39;t expected Isaac to come to that kind of understanding so suddenly, and the shift in him caught her off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head slightly, her eyes glinting with curiosity. &#34;Do you really believe that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac paused for only a moment before answering, &#34;I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile touched Verena&#39;s lips as she replied, &#34;Then I&#39;ll count on you, my sweet fiancé.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those last two words were spoken so lightly they might have passed unnoticed, yet they struck something deep inside Isaac. Just hearing her call him that brought him an odd sense of calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You keep drifting off into your own world,&#34; Verena teased,her tone carrying a hint of playfulness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words snapped lsaac back. Only then did he realize she had crouched in front of him, patiently waiting for his help. &#34;My apologies,&#34; he said quickly, gathering the loose ribbons to tie them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved with as much care as he could manage, but his fingers brushed against her skin as he worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your hands are freezing,&#34; Verena remnarked with a soft laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac froze, worried his cold fingers brought her discomfort. He was about to pull back and suggest letting an assistant handle it, but Verena spoke again,her voice carrying quiet concern. &#34;Do you have trouble sleeping at night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her question caught him off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a beat, he gave a small nod. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was that the accident had scarred him mnore in spirit than in body. Ever since that day, restless nights and endless nightmares had haunted him. He hated the weakness he carried, hated even more that his survival had come at his father&#39;s expense. From then on, sleep had felt heavy and hollow,never bringing him any comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena noticed the faint crease in his brow and chose not to press further. She could already guess why he lived with insomnia. Isaac tied the final ribbon just as the sales assistant stepped into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave lsaac a small bow and apologized, saying,&#34;I&#39;m sorry for keeping you waiting, Mr. Bennett. There was a mix-up with the stock.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pressed his lips together before he responded in an even tone, &#34;That&#39;s alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, both he and Verena changed into their wedding outfits, and the staff led them to the location for the photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roughly thirty minutes later, their car rolled to a stop.As they stepped out, the photographer welcomed them with a broad grin. &#34;Mr. Bennett, Mrs. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena sized him up. He was young, with a slight belly,and when he smiled, his eyes curved into cheerful slits,giving him a clumsy but likable appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She returned the smile and nodded politely.&#34;We&#39;ll be counting on you today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The process of taking pre-wedding photos turned out to be detailed and slow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the session started,the photographer positioned them carefully, giving instructions step by step. He arranged them so that Verena stood holding a bouquet, her eyes lowered in a soft smile, while Isaac,seated in his wheelchair, was to wrap one arm around her waist and look at her with affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A staff member handed the bouquet to Verena, and she moved to stand at Isaac&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Bennett, you look stunning. Let&#39;s see a smile,&#34;the photographer remarked warmly, showering her with compliments as he adjusted her pose and waited for just the right angle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his attention shifted. &#34;Mr. Bennett, put your arm around your bride&#39;s waist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze fell on Verena. The gown she wore revealed the sides of her waist, covered only by a thin sheer layer. Placing his hand there would be almost the same as touching her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed still for several seconds, unable to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photographer peeked up from his camera and chuckled. &#34;Mr. Bennett, are you that captivated by how lovely your bride is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes slid toward Isaac, amusement flickering in her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching her look sent a sharp jolt through him. He quickly turned away and lowered his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After more urging from the photographer, he finally raised his arm and rested it on her waist. Because of his seated position, he had to reach higher than felt natural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photographer snapped several shots and then checked the screen. Verena&#39;s pose was graceful,her smile effortless, but lsaac&#39;s hand looked stiff and awkward in the picture. His eyes, instead of showing warmth, were far too serious, leaving the photo without any real trace of romance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photographer turned to Isaac with a grin. &#34;Mr.Bennett, these are pre-wedding photos, not a board meeting. You&#39;ve got to soften up. Let your eyes do the talking-make it look like you adore her so much the camera can feel it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To demonstrate,the photographer widened his eyes in an exaggerated way, and then squinted dramatically,even making circles with his hands to mimic glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena let out a laugh at his performance, while Isaac&#39;s long fingers tightened slightly before he answered, &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reply seemed to reassure the photographer, who went back to arranging them for another pose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he checked the next picture, he groaned. &#34;Mr. Bennett, you look ready to give a speech in front of a crowd, not vow eternal love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image told the story. Verena&#39;s face glowed, her posture graceful and easy, while Isaac sat rigid.His jaw was set, his eyes fixed with too much resolve. Instead of tenderness, the picture carried the weight of a formal portrait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They repeated the process again and again, but the results barely changed. The stiffness lingered in every frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photographer&#39;s booming instructions slowly wore down to a hoarse murmur, his patience draining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac couldn&#39;t remember the last time he felt this out of place. Since the accident, he had never faced a camera while seated in his chair, and now the weight of it pressed heavily on him. Looking at Verena so effortlessly radiant only made him feel like an intruder in his own wedding photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chin dropped, and both hands pressed tightly against his motionless legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing close, Verena caught the change in him.
