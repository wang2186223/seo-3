                <p>If Laura had realized earlier what was at stake, she would never have treated Verena in such a reckless manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret gnawed at her as she thought back-she should have heeded Alec&#39;s warning and avoided stirring the pot before Verena married into the Bennett family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had she let matters escalate into a quarrel with Verena? And to such a bitter extent?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec swallowed hard,desperate to salvage something from the wreckage. &#34;Mr. Bennett, this is all a misunderstanding. You can rely on us-we&#39;ll bring Verena back home immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care what you do.&#34; Isaac&#39;s cold voice cut like ice. &#34;But mark my words-the one l intend to marry is Verena, not some so-called daughter of the Willis family. Don&#39;t dream of wielding your family name to press down on my fiancée.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec now fully grasped Verena&#39;s weight in Isaac&#39;s heart. What else could he possibly say? Without sparing him a glance, Isaac instructed Jacob to take him to Bennett Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob gave a brisk nod and wheeled Isaac out of the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That short visit had made one thing blindingly clear: Verena held a place in Isaac&#39;s life that no one could shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Isaac left, Alec&#39;s anger erupted like a dam breaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See the mess you&#39;ve caused!&#34; he thundered, pointing a trembling finger at Laura, his whole body quaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura stiffened her spine, casting aside her earlier fear,and retorted with steel in her voice, &#34;What did I do? It was Verena, that stubborn girl, who stormed off on her own. How is this my fault?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re still arguing?&#34; Alec&#39;s face burned crimson as he lifted his hand toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,well... are you going to strike me now?&#34; Laura&#39;s voice rose with sharp sarcasm. &#34;Wasn&#39;t it you who allowed me to go upstairs to discipline Verena? And now,with things gone awry, you wash your hands clean and lay all the blame on me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words pierced Alec to the quick &#34;I did let you discipline her, but I never told you to throw her out!&#34; His face tightened,breath heavy.&#34;And Kaia-you used to be obedient. How did you turn so reckless the moment your sister came to live with us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad... how can you say that?&#34; Kaia&#39;s eyes widened,stunned by his sudden scolding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting his cold, furious gaze, Kaia parted her lips,only to feel a surge of anger and resentment twisting inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never imagined Isaac would defend Verena with such ferocity, shattering her plans and leaving her humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her resentment turned not only against Verena but also against Alec for his fickle nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia had long known her father measured worth by profit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever shone brighter and promised greater gain would receive his favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus, she had trained herself never to stumble, never to err.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she had not foreseen that lsaac&#39;s cutting words would overturn Alec&#39;s treatment of her compared to Verena. Hatred flickered in Kaia&#39;s eyes, though she clenched her fists to keep it hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She despised Verena. She despised Alec. To the very marrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Alec&#39;s wrath turn toward Kaia, Laura rushed to shield her, protesting anxiously, &#34;What does this have to do with Kaia? I won&#39;t let you speak to my daughter that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alec, recalling Isaac&#39;s warning, trembled with fury and shouted, &#34;So Kaia is your daughter, and you conveniently forget that Verena is also your daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Verena is my daughter-I haven&#39;t forgotten,&#34;Laura snapped. &#34;But so what? Sooner or later,she&#39;ll marry into the Bennett family and stand against me.She already disrespects me without shame-why should I treat her with kindness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec&#39;s chest heaved as he saw the cold indifference in her eyes. She still hadn&#39;t grasped the gravity of the matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice cracked with rage. &#34;If you know she&#39;s marrying into the Bennett family, can&#39;t you see how easily they could crush us without even lifting a finger?Have you lived in comfort so long that you&#39;ve forgotten the hardships we clawed through to reach this point? Teaching Verena a lesson is one thing,but you dared to drive her from our home!&#34; He sucked in a breath and shouted, &#34;Laura, how can you be so heartless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I&#39;m the villain?&#34; Laura sneered, rolling her eyes. &#34;Alec,weren&#39;t you the one who allowed me to teach Verena a lesson? Without your approval, would I have dared? Now that it&#39;s gone awry, you pretend to be righteous and throw all the blame on me. Stop acting like a saint!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After decades together, Laura knew every crevice of Alec&#39;s mind and laid his hypocrisy bare with a few words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humiliated before his children, Alec&#39;s fury boiled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ground out between clenched teeth, &#34;You shameless liar!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura shot back instantly, &#34;Liar? Then what are you?A cunning fox? Or a hypocritical pretender?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushed past his limit, Alec raised his hand, ready to strike her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kaia and Luka rushed forward, pulling them apart</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura, clutched by Kaia, snapped coldly, &#34;Let go, Kaia I want to see if he truly has the guts to hit me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madwoman! Lunatic!&#34; Alec spat, straining against Luka&#39;s grip as if to lunge again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough! stop causing unnecessary drama!&#34; Luka&#39;s voice thundered across the room, cutting through the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec and Laura froze, and once Alec ceased struggling,Kaia released her hold on her mother&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All three turned to Luka.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luka took in the sight-his father&#39;s disheveled suit, his mother&#39;s tousled hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His frown deepened. &#34;Dad, Mom, I know you&#39;re furious about Verena, but don&#39;t forget Isaac&#39;s words before he left. He said plainly he will only marry Verena-not a daughter of the Willis family. The meaning is crystal clear. Whether she returns home or not, his decision stands. But now that she&#39;s stormed out in anger, if we fail to win her forgiveness before the wedding,she will turn Isaac against us. And the Bennett family can topple us as easily as snapping a twig.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luka exhaled, speaking with calm reason.&#34;The priority now is not to quarrel but to devise a strategy to mend this. Otherwise, all our shouting will only hasten our downfall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other three Willis family members had been swept away by emotion, blind to reason. Only Luka, standing a step outside the fray,kept his head cool and pinpointed the crux of the matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing his clear analysis, Alec felt a sting of shame,though he masked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening his back, he smoothed his collar and forced composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing his throat, he nodded stiffly. &#34;Luka is right.We cannot afford to offend Isaac. The urgent task is to fix this matter at once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura, too, steadied herself after Luka&#39;s sober reminder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The four Willis family members sank onto the sofas,their minds heavy with worry as they pondered a way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long silence,Alec finally broke it.this moment, there is only one solution.&#34;</p>
