                <p>With a gentle smile, Verena took Cayden&#39;s hand and held it firmly. &#34;Dr. Moore, you only had Isaac&#39;s health in mind.Why would I take offense? There&#39;s nothing wrong with being careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonardo also stood up to greet her. &#34;My name&#39;s Leonardo Gibson. It&#39;s a pleasure to finally meet you.&#34;He carried himself with a maturity that gave him a steady presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile touched Verena&#39;s lips as she inclined her head in response. &#34;Nice to meet you, Leonardo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward,Leonardo chuckled and tapped the shoulder of the man at his side. &#34;Here&#39;s the star of tonight&#39;s gathering-Stevie Wagner, back from his time overseas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Stevie froze for a second, and then jumped to his feet in a hurry. &#34;Hi, Verena. I&#39;m Stevie Wagner.Glad to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words spilled out in a stiff rush, and his jerky movements made him look like a clumsy puppet, which drew laughter from the others at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re still terrible at meeting new people, Stevie,&#34; Cayden teased with an easy grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stevie&#39;s hand went to the back of his neck, and his reddened face gave him the awkward air of a shy student.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching out without hesitation, Verena returned his handshake and smiled warmly.good to meet you as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon afterward, the servers brought in the dishes, and the four old friends slipped into lighthearted conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The talk about a drinking penalty was nothing more than Cayden joking, since everyone knew lsaac&#39;s health didn&#39;t allow him to drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the most part, Verena ate quietly, though she joined in whenever the topic turned toward her.  The three men filled the air with lively chatter, while Verena and Isaac focused on their dishes and, almnost in unison, served each other food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their hands paused when they realized what they&#39;d done. Their gazes met for a heartbeat, and then both lowered their eyes and laughed softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trio across from them couldn&#39;t miss it. They traded looks, each one buzzing with unspoken meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stevie leaned back with suspicion clear on his face. Was this really how arranged matches worked? First the blanket, and now sharing food? That level of closeness seemed far too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cayden turned toward Leonardo, clearly searching for an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of helping, Leonardo only lifted his shoulders in a helpless shrug, as if to say he was just as clueless.When the meal was nearly finished, Verena rosefrom the table and excused herself to the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had she left than Stevie edged closer to Isaac and murmured, &#34;I almost kept this to myself, but since you commissioned it, I&#39;ll hand it over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Cayden and Leonardo stayed wrapped up in their own conversation, too distracted to notice the quiet exchange happening beside them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze dropped to the black velvet box that Stevie was holding out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about? When did I ever commission this?&#34; he asked with confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Believing Isaac had forgotten, Stevie explained patiently, &#34;It was a month or two before your accident. You called me and said you were chasing after a woman you truly loved, and you wanted me to find someone who could design a necklace just for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression softened as he continued, &#34;Things didn&#39;t go as you hoped, but you already paid for it. What you choose to do with it now is up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no room for refusal, Stevie pressed the box into Isaac&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac froze, his gaze fixed on the box for what felt like ages, bewilderment and astonishment flickering in his eyes. A woman he had truly loved... had there ever been one? Stevie could be reckless and unpredictable at times, yet he wasn&#39;t the kind of man who would deceive himn, much less make light of something so serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to force the memory to surface, Isaac furrowed his brow. Yet the harder he searched, the emptier his mind became. When had he ever been in love with a woman? Why couldn&#39;t he remember a single detail?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking his head firmly, Isaac pushed the thought aside. &#34;No. I never asked you to order this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stevie froze in disbelief, his voice pitching higher. &#34;Isaac, don&#39;t mess with me. I&#39;ve still got the proof of that transfer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening his banking app, he shoved the screen toward Isaac and said with a teasing grin,&#34;Look at this.Did you really forget? You wouldn&#39;t stop saying she was the only one for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The record left no room for doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Isaac&#39;s thoughts were completely blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s cheerful voice chimed in as she walked back toward the table, &#34;What are you two whispering about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s shoulders tensed. On instinct, he slid the small box into his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stevie parted his lips, ready to brush it off, but Isaac interjected quickly, &#34;Nothing important. I was just asking about his time overseas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an easy smile, Verena accepted the answer. &#34;Alright then, carry on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stevie snapped his mouth shut and shot lsaac a side glance. Quick thinking, he thought. Isaac always managed to cover himself well. Still, the man hadn&#39;t actually asked him anything about life abroad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time their gathering wrapped up, the clock had already passed ten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was late when they finally reached home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena slipped into the bathroom for a shower, while Isaac wheeled himself quietly into the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking out the box, he lifted the lid. Resting inside was a crystal necklace, its flawless shine revealing a piece of craftsmanship far from ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of admiring it, Isaac sat there frowning. If Stevie&#39;s story was real, how could he have no recollection at all? If he&#39;d once been in love with someone, he would have told the girl honestly before agreeing to the marriage arrangement with the Willis family. Responsibility wasn&#39;t something he ever avoided. Yet his mind offered nothing, not even a trace of memory. And still, Stevie had no reason to lie. Between the bank record and the necklace, the evidence couldn&#39;t be denied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pressed his hands over his face, and then stared blankly at the ceiling. Confusion clouded his eyes,and not even he could piece it together. He understood he should be honest with his wife about matters of the heart, yet he couldn&#39;t bring himself to let Verena see this strange part of his past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning arrived, and Isaac left for work earlier than usual. Verena also rose at dawn, enjoying a rare stretch of quiet while tending to the flowers in the garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That calm was soon broken, as uninvited visitors showed up without so much as a warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper, Rhonda Walker, hurried across the garden and called out, &#34;Mrs. Bennett, your parents have arrived. They&#39;re waiting in the living room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s face remained calm. She had already expected this moment would come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. Go on back to what you were doing,&#34; she replied evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda gave a quick nod before returning to her chores.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting the pruning shears aside, Verena let out a faint sigh and headed toward the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t even stepped inside when Alec&#39;s voice drifted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luka had a sudden fever the other day, so it delayed us. Now that we&#39;re finally here, be sure you speak nicely,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura seemed to grasp the seriousness this time. With less of her usual bite, she bobbed her head quickly.&#34;I get it, I get it. Don&#39;t worry. With the two of us together, she&#39;s coming home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning casually against the doorframe, Verena crossed her arms and studied the couple lounging on the sofa. A bitter smile tugged at her lips. Their little act could rival any Shakespearean performance, and real life seemed to be their favorite stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood tall and called out, &#34;Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cold tone sliced through the room, and Alec and Laura instantly forced smiles as they rose to greet her.&#34;Oh, Verena, I&#39;ve missed you terribly!&#34; Laura exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Verena, the words dripped with hypocrisy. She couldn&#39;t help but think Laura ought to fear divine punishment for such insincerity. Then again, someone like her clearly had no conscience to trouble her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura reached for her hand with false affection. &#34;You&#39;ve gotten thinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena pulled her hand away without a word and calmly wiped it clean with a tissue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their smiles faltered. Laura&#39;s eyes flashed with anger, though she quickly masked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acting as if he hadn&#39;t noticed, Alec kept a gentle expression. &#34;Please don&#39;t be upset with us, sweetheart.Just come back home with us. I&#39;m begging you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice cracked as though he might break down in tears, and his eyes glistened with sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to Laura, Alec&#39;s performance nearly fooled Verena-it was that convincing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena crushed the used tissue in her hand, and then tossed it into the trash with deliberate aim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sweetheart?&#34; Her lips twisted into a sharp smile as her gaze hardened. &#34;What gave you the idea I was that close to you?&#34;</p>
