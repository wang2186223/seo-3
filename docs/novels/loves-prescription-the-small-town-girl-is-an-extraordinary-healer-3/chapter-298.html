                <p>Luther looked genuinely puzzled at Verena&#39;s question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t Mr. Bennett ever mention that to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s brows drew together.&#34;Mention what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set down his coffee cup, clasped his hands on the table, and fixed her with a steady gaze.&#34;So you really don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve been giving Mr. Bennett therapy sessions every week.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stroked his beard, satisfaction flickering across his face, before adding, &#34;Here&#39;s the good news-he can stand on his own now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lashes quivered, as though the ground had shifted beneath her feet. Could Isaac truly stand?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Luther in disbelief, lips parting, yet no sound found its way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patiently, Luther continued, &#34;It only happens in moments of crisis-and always when it&#39;s about you.The time is fleeting, but it&#39;s still a breakthrough. It means he&#39;s no longer chaining himself to guilt over his father&#39;s death, refusing to move. And more than that, it proves just how deeply you matter to him.&#34; Luther leaned forward, his voice earnest. &#34;If you can,create moments where he has no choice but to rise -even to run toward you. Counseling has softened the weight of his guilt. Because now,he has someone he longs to protect. That someone is you. Give him those chances, and step by step, he&#39;ll only grow stronger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock and joy mingled in Verena&#39;s eyes like light meeting shadow. &#34;Thank you. I&#39;ll take your advice to heart-for his recovery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She unlocked her phone, slid it across the table, and said, &#34;By the way, Dr. Owen, since you&#39;re the expert,I need your opinion on something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows pinched as she explained, &#34;These are my mother&#39;s medical records. After I was taken from her as a child, she lost her grip on reality. From what I can see,it all stems from emotional trauma. Should we begin with therapy, or treat the physical symptoms caused by her state first?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther picked up the phone and pored over the records carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face grew solemn, his blue eyes sharpening with focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena sat in silence, her fingers tracing idle patterns on the tablecloth.At last, Luther looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tapped the table lightly, as though gathering his thoughts into order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he spoke, calm yet firm, &#34;Mrs. Bennett, from both this file and what you&#39;ve told me, the key to your mother&#39;s stability lies with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, noting the flicker of confusion in Verena&#39;s eyes. &#34;Think about it-family ties wield enormous power. For your mother, you alone can reach into the depths of her memories and emotions. I can guide her as a psychologist. But in this matter, my role will never outweigh yours.&#34;</p>
