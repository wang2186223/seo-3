                <p>Stevie frowned in confusion. &#34;Dig into someone? What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s face was grim, his gaze sharp as steel. &#34;His name&#39;s Simon Moss. Born in Clokron, though his roots trace back to Akoitha. He recently joined Verena&#39;s hospital as a psychologist. After my first attempt at rehabilitation failed, Verena thought my condition might be psychological, so she arranged for him to treat me. But the moment our sessions began, I felt something off. His hostility toward me isn&#39;t even subtle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice sank lower, carrying the weight of suspicion. &#34;I&#39;m convinced he&#39;s got hidden intentions where Verena is concerned. I want you to dig up everything on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anyone could do it, it was Stevie-his hacking skills were unmatched, and Isaac knew he&#39;d leave no stone unturned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the mention of someone openly hostile to Isaac, Stevie bristled, his protective instincts flaring.&#34;Don&#39;t worry, Isaac. If he tries anything, I&#39;ll make sure he regrets it. But...&#34; He hesitated, and then voiced his concern. &#34;Are you certain he&#39;s after Verena? Could this just be your feelings talking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t doubt about Verena&#39;s appeal. Stevie simply knew how consumed lsaac was by her. His possessiveness was legendary, and Stevie feared that intensity might be coloring his judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac caught the undertone in Stevie&#39;s words, but he dismissed it without hesitation. His gut had never steered him wrong, and the malice he&#39;d felt in Simon&#39;s stare was far too real to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not that oblivious, Stevie,&#34; he said, his voice low but firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight in his tone made Stevie straighten instantly.&#34;Alright, I get it,&#34; he replied quickly. &#34;Maybe I was reading too much into things. Don&#39;t worry, Isaac. I&#39;ll dig into Simon Moss until there&#39;s nothing left hidden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at Isaac&#39;s lips. &#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stevie let out a light laugh on the other end. &#34;Come on, Isaac, we&#39;re best friends. No need for thanks. Just focus on getting better at the hospital and leave the rest to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the call ended, Isaac finally allowed himself a brief rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he woke again, his phone buzzed with a call from Jacob, who reported in a steady tone. &#34;Mr.Bennett,we&#39;ve finished the initial background check. Simon Moss graduated from Wrafpost University, one of the most prestigious schools in Clokron. Afterward, he was recruited by a leading hospital there. Former colleagues describe him as cheerful, proactive, and empathetic. He&#39;s even known for taking in stray cats and dogs. Professionally, his reputation is strong as well-he&#39;s received several highly regarded medical awards. I&#39;ve already sent the detailed report and photos to your email. Please review them when you have the chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cheerful.Proactive. Empathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes narrowed, something about that portrait grating against his instincts. The words painted a flawless image, yet it all felt... off, like a mask too perfect to be real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing his fingers to his brow, he spoke quietly. &#34;Understood. You can.return to your work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Mr. Bennett,&#34; Jacob answered respectfully before the linè went dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s brow furrowed. Jacob&#39;s report was just surface fluff that told him nothing of real value. If there were answers, they would have to come from Stevie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three days slipped by quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that time, lsaac submitted himself to Verena&#39;s routine examinations. Every day, she worked her hands carefully over his legs, massaging them with patient diligence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, one morning, his phone buzzed. Stevie&#39;s name lit the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac answered immediately, &#34;What did you find?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Stevie was quiet for a beat before replying, &#34;Isaac, I dug through everything I could. His records are spotless. His background lines up perfectly. Nothing suspicious turned up, even after. I ran the checks multiple times. I thought I might&#39;ve missed something, but no-there&#39;s nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac parted his lips, ready to speak, but Stevie&#39;s tone shifted suddenly, lightened with amusement. &#34;But...I did stumble across something interesting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac arched a brow. &#34;And what&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stevie&#39;s chuckle carried through the line. &#34;Didn&#39;t you say you thought he was eyeing your wife? Turns out,according to what I found, Simon isn&#39;t into women at all. He&#39;s interested in men. Could it be you&#39;re reading too much into things because you&#39;re a little too protective of Verena?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interested in men?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s expression darkened, a flicker of conflicting emotions flashing across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac couldn&#39;t shake the unease. Simon&#39;s record might have been clean on paper, but his instincts told a different story. That flicker of hostility in the man&#39;s eyes had been real, and Isaac was certain Simon was interested in Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether or not the rumor about him preferring men was true didn&#39;t matter. The truth would come out with the right test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the line, Stevie sounded almost incredulous at Isaac&#39;s silence. &#34;You really don&#39;t believe me? Isaac,my intel&#39;s solid-it&#39;s never wrong.&#34;	 Isaac steadied his thoughts before answering, his voice low but resolute, &#34;We&#39;re not dismissing him that easily. Keep a close watch. Even if he&#39;s truly interested in men, there&#39;s no guarantee that&#39;s the full story.Anyone who could pose a threat to Verena stays under scrutiny.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause, and then Stevie agreed without hesitation. &#34;Got it. I&#39;ll keep digging. If anything shifts,you&#39;ll be the first to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her office, Verena sifted through Isaac&#39;s recent test results, carefully analyzing the subtle changes in his psychological state. His progress was undeniable-steady, visible improvement across the board.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pleased,she immediately dialed Ivan&#39;s number. The call connected almost instantly, and his exuberant voice spilled through the line. &#34;Verena! You won&#39;t believe this-we must be on the same wavelength, because l was just about to call you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even without seeing him, she could picture the sparkle in his eyes and the mischievous curve of his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her own mouth lifted into a faint smile. &#34;Enough joking, Ivan. I have something serious to discuss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan&#39;s laugh carried easily through the line. &#34;Alright then, what&#39;s so urgent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena straightened in her chair, her tone all business. &#34;I need you to track down the top psychologist overseas-Luther Owen. If I recall correctly, you&#39;ve crossed paths with him before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luther?&#34; Ivan&#39;s chuckle deepened. &#34;I&#39;ve known him for years. Consider it done. But actually, there&#39;s something I need to ask you too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one concern already lifted off her shoulders, Verena exhaled softly. &#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan&#39;s instincts as a hacker had always kept him cautious. Sensitive matters were never for phone calls. His tone dropped, firm and deliberate. &#34;Not over the line. Let&#39;s sit down face-to-face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena knew him well enough not to argue. His habits were ingrained, and she respected them.&#34;Fine111she replied smoothly. &#34;This afternoon.&#34; Later that day, she arrived at the quiet coffee shop they&#39;d chosen. The staff guided her to a private booth tucked away in the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan was already there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat sprawled comfortably in a loose black utility jacket, his curls falling naturally around his face. A glint of blue caught the light-the earring on his left ear. Dark sunglasses rested low on his nose, just enough to reveal the sharp gleam of hazel eyes underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in such a casual getup, he carried the same effortless presence as always-laid-back, yet impossible not to notice.</p>
