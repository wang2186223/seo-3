                <p>Kaia had already taken her seat at the dining table by the time Isaac made his way downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flicked past him, searching for Verena, but she only found Isaac and the house staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put on her sweetest smile. &#34;Isaac,is my sister still asleep?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac guided his wheelchair toward the table, refusing to look her way or acknowledge her question, as though she wasn&#39;t even there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tryinng to hide her discomfort, Kaia forced her lips into another smile and turned her attention to Rhonda.&#34;Rhonda, are you not going to call my sister for breakfast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda came out of the kitchen carrying a plate of toast. &#34;Mrs. Bennett left early this morning. She took her suitcase with her,&#34; she answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news caught Kaia off guard. She pressed for more.&#34;She left? Did she say anything about where she was headed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda gave a small shake of her head. &#34;She didn&#39;t  tell us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn had specifically told Kaia to keep tabs on Verena,yet somehow Verena had managed to leave right under her nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration rose up, and Kaia&#39;s voice lost its friendly edge. &#34;You didn&#39;t even think to ask her where she was going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda froze for a moment at her sudden outburst,silently thinking that this young ladyfrom the Willis family was stepping far over the line;even Verena herself would never treat her this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,since Kaia was Verena&#39;s sister, Rhonda kept her composure and answered respectfully, &#34;It isn&#39;t our place to question Mrs. Bennett&#39;s affairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still not satisfied, Kaia tried again. &#34;But you must have some idea,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hesitant look crossed Rhonda&#39;s face. &#34;Honestly, I have no clue...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, growing irritated by Kaia&#39;s persistent questions,shot her a sharp look and spoke in a firm voice.&#34;Kaia,your sister agreed to let you stay as a guest, not as a spy. You should learn your place. Keep crossing the line and I won&#39;t be so polite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharpness of his words made Kaia stiffen. Admiration for lsaac&#39;s background and looks had faded as she had realized what truly counted was something else entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Kaia, Isaac, with his disability, now seemed like any other man-powerful but far from perfect, hardly deserving of her admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,his reputation made her think twice about pushing her luck. Only now did she realize how reckless she&#39;d just been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warning stung, but Kaia managed to keep her tone pleasant. &#34;Isaac, you&#39;re reading too much into it.I&#39;m just worried about my sister, that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without glancing her way, Isaac returned his attention to breakfast, quietly eating without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His silence cut deeper than any argument, but Kaia remembered what her impatience had cost her before,and forced herself to swallow her irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finished her meal without bringing up Verena again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Isaac left for work, Kaia hurried upstairs and reached for her phone, dialing Katelyn in a rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call barely connected before Katelyn&#39;s voice came through. &#34;What&#39;s going on over there?&#34; Kaia wasted no time. &#34;Verena left this morning,suitcase in hand. Nobody knows where she went.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, suspicion creeping into her tone.&#34;Katelyn, do you think Verena&#39;s planning something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with a suitcase this early?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s frown deepened as she mulled it over, her expression shifting as she pieced things together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She muttered to herself, &#34;Leaving with luggage probably means she&#39;s traveling-and it can&#39;t be for something minor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the realization struck, a sly smile played on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Verena was off on a trip now, maybe she and Isaac had a falling out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since they&#39;d first met, Katelyn believed V/erena was a poor match for lsaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This might finally be the moment their marriage hit a rough patch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that were the case, getting close to lsaac would be much simpler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Katelyn stayed cautious. Reining in her excitement, she kept her instructions clear. &#34;Just stay where you are and pay attention to lsaac. Wait until tomorrow to see if Verena comes back, and then report to me. And Kaia-don&#39;t do anything unless I say so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After losing to Verena several times, Kaia now thought twice before acting out again. Years of admiration for Evelyn meant she followed her instructions to the letter now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded several times, eager to please. &#34;Don&#39;t worry,K&lt;atelyn. I&#39;ll do exactly as you say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While flying, Verena managed to catch a little sleep.As soon as the plane touched down, she turned off airplane mode on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A message pinged almost instantly-it was from Isaac,sent just a couple of minutes earlier. &#34;Did you land yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile spread across Verena&#39;s lips as she tapped out a reply. &#34;Just got here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after she sent her response, the noise of camera shutters and people talking reached her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced up to see a tall, broad-shouldered man making his way through the crowd. Although his hair was streaked with gray at the temples, there was no denying his good looks and presence. Thanks to the photo Samuel had sent, Verena recognized Tobin immediately. She slipped her phone into her bag,raised her hand, and called out, &#34;Tobin,over here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin had never met her face to face, but before boarding, she&#39;d told him she&#39;d call out to him once she landed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped in his tracks when he heard his name,surprised to find a young woman waving at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with sunglasses and a mask, her poise and the shape of her figure made it clear she was young and attractive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was the elusive, much-taked-about Legendary Surgeon-a woman, and a striking one at that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin could hardly believe it, but he kept hisreaction hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put on a warm smile, stepped over, and slipped an arm around Verena&#39;s shoulders. &#34;Sweetheart, I&#39;ve been waiting for you forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of cameras intensified as reporters pressed closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One shouted above the noise, &#34;Mr. Fairclough, is this your girlfriend from Akoitha?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone else piped up with another question. &#34;Mr.Fairclough, your wife passed away three years ago.This is the first time you&#39;ve gone public with a girlfriend. Are you worried about how your children will take it, or do you see yourself making this official?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, Tobin shot a quick look at his assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Javier picked up the cue, stepping forward to address the press. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but we can&#39;t answer those questions right now. Thanks for understanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no further response, the reporters had to settle for snapping more photos, hoping to catch something newsworthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They trailed Tobin and Verena all the way to the car before finally giving up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling into her seat, Verena looked out at the crowd still snapping pictures and turned to Tobin. &#34;You really know how to handle the press. That&#39;s some serious business skill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin watched the cameras for a moment before focusing on her. &#34;Word&#39;s already reached Erick. He&#39;s waiting at the house for a spectacle. Aren&#39;t you the least bit concerned all this attention could blow your cover?&#34; Meeting his gaze, Verena gave a confident smirk. &#34;I&#39;m not the type to take risks unless I know the outcome.By the time your brother figures things out, your father will be out of danger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pride in her voice fit her perfectly, adding to her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin couldn&#39;t help staring, and Verena caught him.She shot him a sideways glance and teased, &#34;Didn&#39;t anyone ever teach you it&#39;s rude to stare?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small, amused grin, Tobin finally looked away.&#34;I just didn&#39;t expect Evelyn to be so young.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena just smiled, letting the compliment hang in the air. &#34;Hard to explain over the phone, isn&#39;t it? So, tell me more about your father. Anything strange happen recently?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His initial surprise faded as Tobin explained his father&#39;s sudden collapse and what followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They talked as the driver pulled up to the Fairclough family&#39;s garage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting out, Verena noticed the prying eyes watching them and slipped her arm into Tobin&#39;s, playing up the image.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone looking on would think they were truly a  couple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Fairclough home looked like something from a storybook-a grand house nestled against green woods and overlooking wide, rolling meadows. The place radiated calm and quiet beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena stepped inside with Tobin, she found herself in a grand dining room where a man in his thirties sat at the end of a long table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His dark suit was perfectly pressed, sharp features set in a constant scowl, and the way his narrowed eyes sized up the room gave him a menacing edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick watched their approach, drawing out his words as he spoke. &#34;So this is the woman who&#39;s caught my brother&#39;s eye. I get it now-she&#39;s definitely easier on the eyes than those girls he used to date.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had already taken off her sunglasses and mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin&#39;s brow furrowed at the sound of his crude and disrespectful words, and he gave a stern warning &#34;Erick, mind the way you speak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Erick wasn&#39;t finished poking at him. He let out a mocking laugh. &#34;What, getting protective already?You must be falling hard,Tobin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin didn&#39;t take the bait. He simply said to Verena,&#34;This is my younger brother, Erick.&#34; Verena greeted Erick with a soft smile. &#34;Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fairclough. I&#39;m Verena Willis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick only offered a brief, dismissive look and stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guiding Verena to a seat beside him, Tobin turned gentle. &#34;That flight must have worn you out. Let&#39;s get you something to eat first,&#34; he said before asking the staff to bring out food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While thestaff moved around them, Erick couldn&#39;t keep his eyes off Verena, a flicker of suspicion in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He broke the silence. &#34;I&#39;ve got a question for you,Miss Willis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced up, meeting his stare. &#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He searched her face. &#34;My brother hasn&#39;t even set foot in Akoitha this year. When exactly did you two cross paths?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Verena let a teasing note slip into her answer. &#34;Who says you have to meet face-to-face to get close these days? There&#39;s the internet for that.Tobin and I met online, and after talking for months,we just clicked. It felt right, so here we are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes sparkled with the excitement of telling the story,cheeks pink like a girl caught up in her first romance. &#34;You wouldn&#39;t believe how he started chatting with me. The real surprise? I had no idea he was the influential Fairclough family&#39;s eldest son. If I&#39;d known, I&#39;d never have had the nerve to answer his first message.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick watched her act the part of someone totally out of place in an upscale home, and any suspicion he had started to fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, Verena seemed like nothing more than a pretty distraction for his brother-someone harmless,maybe even a little naive. He figured he&#39;d been too quick to doubt her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk tugged at his lips. &#34;Spare me the romance stories. I&#39;m not interested in hearing about you and Tobin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the meal ended, Tobin turned to Verena. &#34;Let&#39;s go see my father,&#34; he suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick assumed his brother just wanted to bring a woman to comfort their ailing dad. He didn&#39;t think much of it and let them go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they strolled through the hallway toward the back of the estate, Erick&#39;s assistant leaned in close and spoke in a low voice. &#34;Would you like me to have someone keep an eye on them?&#34; Erick didn&#39;t take his eyes off the pair as Verena clung to Tobin&#39;s arm, pausing here and there to take in the grand paintings or marvel at the fine porcelain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, she fit the role of an outsider dazzled by wealth and luxury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a soft, dismissive laugh, a trace of sarcasm in his eyes. &#34;She&#39;s just a pretty face. Not worth the trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, the assistant stepped back and dropped the subject.</p>
