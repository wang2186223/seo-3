                <p>After a brief silence, a flicker of complexity danced across Luis&#39; face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened, his movements slightly stiff, legs parted just enough to ease the tension running through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for an unopened bottle of water on the coffee table, his long fingers tightened with a crisp click as he twisted the cap open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting his head back, he drank deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chill of the water slid down his throat, quelling the heat that had surged in his chest like a fire meeting the sea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t stop until only a third of the bottle was left,and then screwed the cap on again and placed it neatly back in its spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning into the sofa, he crossed one leg over the other, clasping his fingers loosely on his knee,instantly regaining the composed air of a seasoned businessman With a slight raise of his brow, he fixed his gaze on Miranda, the faintest spark of interest flickering in his eyes. &#34;Go on. What kind of cooperation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Luis rose earlier, Miranda had quietly returned to sitting on the edge of the bed, fastening the robe that had slipped open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up the folder beside her, flipped through its contents, and then lifted her head to meet his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carefree as she often was, her eyes sharpened whenever work came into play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;According to our research, you&#39;ve long harbored ambitions of expanding into Clokron.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, studying the unreadable calm on Luis &#39; face before pressing on. &#34;To be frank, Mr. Sampson,our company has been preparing this collaboration with you for quite some time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lashes lowered for a beat, and then rose with a practiced smile. &#34;We&#39;ve pored over your past strategies and achievements. Your business acumen and methods are praised highly across the industry,and we truly admire them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words were not empty flattery; they mirrored Miranda&#39;s genuine thoughts. &#34;That&#39;s why our company is eager to partner with you,to explore new markets side by side. And conveniently,you are setting your sights on Clokron&#39;s entertainment sector, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis lifted his eyelids slightly, watching her with quiet intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In their previous encounters, she had always carried a devil-may-care attitude, a woman untamed and free as the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But today, her manner bore an unfamiliar weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corner of Luis&#39; lips curved faintly, ripples of intrigue stirring beneath his calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned against the sofa, fingertips drumming a steady rhythm on the armrest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, his low voice broke the silence.&#34;Oh?Then tell me-what advantages do you bring?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda leaned forward, her tone delberate. &#34;Our company is prepared to invest fully. We possess both deep financial reserves and a professional team, able to provide complete support for your Clokron venture.&#34; Luis chuckled quietly, shaking his head. &#34;Miss Brown,do you really think Sampson Group is short of investors?&#34; His voice carried depth and a slight upward lilt, the unshakable pride of a man who knew his worth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And indeed, Sampson Group stood as a giant in the business world-money had never been their stumbling block.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a bargaining chip, investment alone was hardly persuasive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, even as he dismissed her offer, his gaze remained steady on Miranda, as though anticipating her next card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda, unruffled, smiled with quiet determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if our investment takes the form of prime real estate in Clokron-land perfectly suited for entertainment projects? Would you still decline, Mr.Sampson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle shift crossed Luis&#39; features. He knew well what she meant-land considered gold in the industry,its value beyond dispute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his brief hesitation, Miranda&#39;s lips curved as she pressed on. &#34;You know the worth of that land.We already hold the development rights.What we need is a partner with vision-like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis gave a faint, knowing smile. &#34;Miss Brown, that land  is no simple prize. To secure those rights must have cost you dearly. And I don&#39;t believe in gifts without a price tag.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused,voice lowering. &#34;So, what&#39;s your condition?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda tilted her head, a mysterious smile lingering as her slender fingers tapped lightly against the bedsheet, the rhythm faintly enticing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The condition...&#34; Her eyes misted with flirtation,her words trailing into the air like smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis narrowed his gaze, sensing a snare hidden behind her softness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes locked, neither willing to yield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air grew thick-half business, half something far more dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Luis shifted his gaze, as though refusing to be caught in her net.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached up to loosen his tie, but before he could speak,Miranda&#39;s silken voice slipped in,teasing yet firm.&#34;Be my sexual partner-for a year.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis froze mid-motion. He had expected a scheme,but not this audacious demand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sexual partner?&#34; he repeated softly, his tongue  pressing against his cheek, the subtle gesture betraying the irritation hidden beneath his calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside,emotions collided in chaos, yet outwardly he remained steady as stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding a hand into his suit pocket, he retrieved a cigarette, the action smooth and deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a snap, the lighter&#39;s flame rose, casting light into his shadowed eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew in deeply, smoke curling in his chest, the sting of nicotine granting him momentary calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhaling slowly, a ring of smoke drifted upward,darkening his gaze all the more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Brown, you must be truly lonely,&#34; Luis said, his voice low and laced with biting irony. &#34;What, no man in Clokron to keep you company?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned back lazily, cigarette in hand, smoke veiling his face in shifting patterns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda raised her chin, her eyes locked on his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat in the glow of warm light, his sharp features carved into shadow and brilliance alike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His slender fingers cradled the cigarette with practiced ease, the smoke curling upward, shrouding him in a  dangerous sort of allure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once,Miranda thought she disliked men who smoked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now she realized-it wasn&#39;t smoking she despised,only the wrong men holding the cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shrewd as always, she sensed the probing beneath Luis&#39; sarcasm. She only smiled, refusing to take the bait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, Mr. Sampson, you needn&#39;t worry I&#39;ll stray. I don&#39;t juggle two men at once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stretched out her words with playful intent, her gaze drifting over him, teasing just enough to keep him guessing.</p>
