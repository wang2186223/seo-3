                <p>A single lamp cast long shadows across the private room,highlighting every edge of Isaac&#39;s sharp jaw and the tension in his posture. He leaned forward, elbows braced on his knees, the unbuttoned collar of his dark shirt drawing the eye to the cut of his frame. The gloom thickened around him, giving off a sense of dominance that was impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you even realize the kind of trouble you&#39;ve landed yourself in?&#34; Isaac&#39;s voice was cold and unyielding,each word slicing through the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe nodded so hard his whole body trembled, the color draining from his face. Years spent climbing the business ladder had taught him to recognize a dangerous man, and Isaac was morethan just a rumor.Howe had only done as he was told, never expecting to end up face-to-face with someone like this. Now,all he felt was pure dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Bennett, I made a big mistake! Give me another chance-I&#39;ll never cross the line again. Please, just let me go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curled up, Howe dropped lower and lower,bowing  over and over until his forehead nearly scraped the carpet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sound of disgust slipped from Isaac, his eyes flashing with icy cotempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened, taking slow, measured steps toward Howe.Every footfall echoed, turning the silence into something oppressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Isaac drove his foot into Howe&#39;s shoulder, knocking him flat with a sharp cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you&#39;re scared? It&#39;s a bit late for that. You really thought you could get away with tailing her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s voice sounded more like a growl than words,heavy with rage and a threat he didn&#39;t bother to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping to a crouch, he seized Howe&#39;s jaw, forcing the man to meet his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their faces were close, and the icy intensity in Isaac&#39;s stare was enough to make anyone flinch. It was as if he could see straight through Howe, stripping away every last defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who told you to track my wife?&#34; Isaac questioned,the words barely above a whisper, but packed with menace that pressed in on all sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip tightened, making it painfully clear who held  all the power in that room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver ran through Howe&#39;s body. Fear robbed him of his voice, but he clamped his lips together,desperate to keep the secret buried. He understood that talking now would only shift the danger from lsaac to the man pulling the strings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that Howe wouldn&#39;t talk, Isaac&#39;s eyes went colder,his patience running thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a short, cold laugh, and then signaled with a flick of his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the mercenaries moved without hesitation,wrenching Howe&#39;s arm back with brutal efficiency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sickening pop filled the air as the joint gave way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe&#39;s scream split the silence, raw and desperate,echoing off the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat streamed down Howe&#39;s face,glistening under the dim light as he bit down hard, desperate to hold back any sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dangerous glint flared in Isaac&#39;s eyes, his patience hanging by a thread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for a knife from the glass table, he let the blade catch the light before turning back to Howe. Without a second thought, Isaac plunged the knife deep into HHowe&#39;s thigh. The muffled sound of steel sinking into flesh cut through the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe convulsed, his limbs snapping with every wave of agony. His eyes stretched wide in terror, mouth frozen in a silent scream before a guttural, shattering cry escaped-one so fierce it seemed to rattle the bones of the room itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood spread fast, soaking through his pants and dripping onto the cold floor, each drop glinting in the sparse light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wracked with pain, Howe&#39;s fingers dug into his palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ready to open your mouth now?&#34; Isaac&#39;s voice cut through the chaos, flat and chilling, like he was discussing the weather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He loomed over Howe, his gaze cold, locked,impossible to read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain and fear finally broke what was left of Howe&#39;s resolve. He slumped, tears and sweat running together, vision swimming as he fought to stay conscious. Every scrap of defiance vanished from his voice as he blurted out, &#34;It was... Sherwood Kirk. He made me do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words trembled in the air, wrung from him by  agony,his features twisted and slick with sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain became too much to bear. Howe&#39;s confidence shattered, and all he could do was spill everything he knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac showed no reaction, accepting the confession as if he&#39;d expected nothing less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened, his eyes narrowing to slits as he considered the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, Isaac let his lips curl ever so slightly and spoke in avoice edged with cold. &#34;So Sherwood&#39;s gutsier than I thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each word sounded calm, yet danger lingered beneath every syllable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What else did he have you do?&#34; Isaac asked, the words quiet but sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe lowered his head, the knife still jutting from his leg,every throb making him shudder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gritting his teeth,he stammered through the pain, &#34;He..he only told me to keep an eye on Verena. I&#39;m supposed to follow her and report everything. That&#39;s it, I swear. I don&#39;t know anything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was barely above a whisper, each word sapping the last of his strength. Isaac&#39;s brow furrowed as he moved closer, his gaze bearing down. &#34;If you&#39;re hiding something, you&#39;ll wish you&#39;d never crossed me. Think carefully before you answer again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe bobbed his head desperately,terror plain on his face. &#34;I-I promise, that&#39;s all I know. Please, just let me go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes narrowed as he studied Howe&#39;s trembling form, noting the sickly pallor and sheen of sweat.&#34;Your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting his eyes, Howe blurted out, &#34;Howe Adams,&#34; his voice trembling, eyes wide and haunted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lowered himself onto the sofa, crossed his legs,and regarded Howe in silence, deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, a thin, chilling smile curled across Isaac&#39;s lips. He spoke slowly, each word deliberate. &#34;I might just let you live.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope flickered in Howe&#39;s eyes, a desperate spark after so much terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He parted his lips, ready to blurt out thanks, but Isaac cut him off, saying, &#34;But you&#39;ll have to earn it. From now on, you&#39;re working for me-playing both sides.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe&#39;s relief shattered, giving way to confusion and  dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac leaned in, his voice quiet but razor sharp. &#34;Keep feeding Sherwood the updates about Verena as you were told. Make sure nothing feels out of place. But whatever he says, whatever he does, I want a full report. Miss a detail, and we&#39;ll have a problem.Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trapped and out of options, Howe nodded, jaw clenched. &#34;Yes, sir. I get it. I&#39;ll do whatever you say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A satisfied glint flashed in Isaac&#39;s eyes. He grabbed Howe by the collar and spoke in a low, dangerous tone. &#34;Try anything clever, and I&#39;ll make you regret it more than you can imagine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of his hand, Isaac signaled the mercenary to pull Howe to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe leaned heavily on the mercenary, biting back groans as he hobbled away, his leg screaming with every step.</p>
