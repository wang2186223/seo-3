                <p>As Verena stepped into the main hall, she greeted the guests warmnly and raised a glass in their honor,though it was only filled with fruit juice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That detail was no accident-Isaac had arranged it thoughtfully in advance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, mindful of Verena&#39;s health, Isaac suggested she take a rest in the lounge, while he remained behind to host the guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel the care behind his words and, without protest, accepted his suggestion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the lounge, elegant flower baskets from the guests lined both sides of the corridor, a silent parade of courtesy and good wishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena paused, letting her eyes linger on them, when her gaze caught a card tucked among a basket of lilies. The names Alec and Laura stood out boldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never invited them.	5</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear they must have seen the news reports and hurried here, eager to flaunt their blood ties with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s brows drew together in a faint frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to instruct someone to remove the basket, Alec&#39;s voice drifted from behind her.&#34;Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned, only to find Alec anc Laura approaching with wide, eager smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec&#39;s familiar, flattering tone made her stomach twist with diståste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood quietly, her expression cool, watching the hypocritical pair draw near.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could speak, Alec hurried forward, his grin stretching wide. &#34;Verena, you&#39;ve really accomplished something remarkable. As your parents, we&#39;re truly proud of you. Having such an outstanding daughter is</p>
                
                
                
                <p>our greatest pride. You&#39;ve been clever and capable since childhood, and we always believed you were destined for greatness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words dripped with sycophancy, his smile so forced that the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes bunched like crumpled paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, he kept stealing glances at Verena, trying to read her reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura quickly nodded in agreement, adding, &#34;Yes, Verena, you&#39;ve always been our pride. Please, don&#39;t hold the past against us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, she had disliked Verena openly. But the tide had turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now Verena was not only Isaac&#39;s wife, but also revered far and wide as Evelyn, the healer spoken of almost with awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura dared not let such wealth and status slip away like sand through her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, her smile only grew brighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The couple continued their chatter, piling one insincere compliment on top of another, as though a stream of empty words could wash away the wounds they had left behind.60</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They never noticedthe flicker of mockery in Verena&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, their act was nothing more than a hollow charade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her chin, she fixed them with an icy stare. A faint scoff escaped her lips.11SO1,now you&#39;ve come to compliment me? Do you think I would so easily forget the hurtful words and actions you once threw at me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was sharp as a frosted blade, every word cutting with cold finality. &#34;When you thought I was worthless, you feared | would disgrace you. Now that I stand here, it is I who fears you&#39;ll disgrace me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed on Alec as she continued, &#34;Out of respect for my grandma, l&#39;ve let you off, which is the only reason Willis Group still stands. But if I find you trading under my name, don&#39;t blame me for being merciless. If others bring me up in your presence, you had better be honest and tell them the truth-that we have cut all ties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words struck Alec like cold iron, and his face turned ashen. Regret gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had assumed that, with so many eyes watching, Verena would swallow her anger and give a courteous reply to spare him humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he had never imagined she would turn so unflinchingly cold.</p>
