                <p>Less than an hour later, Verena pulled up outside a sprawling private estate where a middle-aged man stood waiting at the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she stepped out, the man walked briskly toward her. &#34;You must be Dr. Willis, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she nodded to confirm it, he said warmly, gesturing for her to follow, &#34;Great, this way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They moved through the corridors and entered a room lined with gleaming display cases, each one filled with medals and awards. An elderly man lay propped on a bed, sweat beading his forehead as a younger man helped him sip water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bring the medical kit-now,&#34; Barrie instructed as soon as he spotted Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze shifted to the younger man. &#34;Slater, get a chair for Dr. Willis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater grabbed a chair without delay, but when he turned around and was about to gesture for Dr. Willis to sit, he froze, his attention caught entirely by the woman before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first thing that stuck him was how effortlessly beautiful she was-delicate features framed by an air of quiet confidence. The second was disbelief. Could this poised young woman really be the famed Dr. Willis his grandfather often praised?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a quick blink, forcing himself back to the moment before offering her a courteous smile. &#34;Please,Dr. Willis, take this seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Verena replied, her tone warm as she accepted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile she gave him felt like the first breath of spring air after a long winter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A simple curve of her lips shouldn&#39;t have left an impression, yet it stirred something faint in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he steadied himself, theservants entered with the prepared medical instruments. Verena reached for a pair of scissors, glancing at Barrie. &#34;I&#39;ll need to cut the fabric above your knee to examine the injury &#34;Do whatever you must,&#34; Barrie said firmly, not flinching despite the sweat sliding down his temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a swift and steady motion, she sliced the trouser leg cleanly up to the thigh, her movements practiced and precise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The damage beneath was impossible to miss-skin swollen tight, bruises blooming around the wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wwas the same leg that had carried a bullet wound from Barrie&#39;s youth, a reminder of the battle that left him with a burden he would never fully escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The injury had happened years back, but the pain never truly left him. As the seasons shifted from autumn to winter, it flared with such intensity that sleep became a rare luxury, whether it was day or night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps rippled through the room the moment everyone caught sight of the swollen knee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concern etched itself across Slater&#39;s face as his gaze lingered on the injury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without letting her expression shift, Verena leaned closer for a precise look. &#34;I&#39;m going to begin with the treatment. It might sting, so try to hold still.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dry chuckle escaped Barrie. &#34;I&#39;ve endured worse in my time. This willbe nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still carry the grit of a soldier, Mr. Lyons,&#34; Verena replied, the praise genuine in her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their history as doctor and patient meant Barrie knew what kind of tools she might need and had them prepared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the world knew her for her surgical skill, her deepest strength lay in the art of traditional medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the driving forces behind her studies in Clokron had been the desire to unite the best of both traditional and modern medicine, giving her patients every advantage in recovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the medical bag, she drew out an assortment of silver needles, each chosen for a specific point, and placed them with flawless precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner, Slater watched the confident rhythm of her hands, the quiet focus in her eyes,and couldn&#39;t help but be struck by how capable she seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the final needle was in place, Barrie&#39;s face had turned ashen, and the veins along his forehead throbbed visibly beneath his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My grandfather looks like he needs water,&#34; Slater said, his brow knitting in worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still jotting notes onto a prescription pad, Verena responded flatly, &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary. This reaction is expected. He&#39;ll be fine in a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words proved true. Within minutes, the strain in Barrie&#39;s face eased, color returned, and the chill in his leg was replaced by a spreading warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only you can take away this pain, Dr. Willis,&#34; Barrie remarked, relief clear in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater exhaled slowly, the tension leaving his shoulders, though amazement still lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes shifted to Verena, who sat with her head gently bowed, completely focused on jotting down the prescription. A few loose strands framed her face, and there was something quietly captivating in the way she moved. It made it nearly impossible to pull his gaze away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many women had caught Slater&#39;s eye before, yet none carried the kind of presence Verena did. What he felt wasn&#39;t the fleeting thrill of attraction, but something sharper, weightier-an awareness that she stood on a level far above his reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t the pull of romance; it was the quiet reverence a person might feel when looking at the moon,knowing it was beautiful yet untouchable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty minutes passed before Verena began removing the silver needles from Barrie&#39;s leg with practiced care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The medicine&#39;s ready,&#34; she said, her tone calm but deliberate. &#34;This time, Mr. Lyons, you need to stick to the plan. Your condition&#39;s been dragged out far too long. We might not be able to heal it completely, but we can take most of the pain away. Take the medicine, rest properly, and in this weather-keep warm at all times.&#34; Barrie, who once commanded the room like a general, now looked almost shy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Dr. Willis. I&#39;ll take your advice seriously this time,&#34; he said with a sheepish chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The change in him caught Slater off guard. He wasn&#39;t used to seeing his grandfather defer to anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Barrie&#39;s sheepish look, Verena offered a light smile. &#34;It&#39;s getting late. I should be going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was getting ready to leave, Barrie turned to Slater and spoke without hesitation.&#34;Make sure you settle the payment with Dr. Willis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, still smiling. &#34;There&#39;s no fee. I didn&#39;t provide the medicine or the tools. Just spent some time on the treatment. Besides, after everything you&#39;ve done for our country,helping you is an honor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man like Barrie, a soldier who had fought and bled for his country, was someone she held in the highest regard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words seemed to warm him even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re young, yet your skills are outstanding, and your manner is even better,&#34; he said with genuine admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his eyes shifted toward Slater, mischief creeping into his voice. &#34;If my grandson were as capable as you, I&#39;d have encouraged him to try to win you over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater&#39;s cheeks flushed the moment he heard those words. &#34;Come on, Grandpa, where did that even come from?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Used to handling moments like this with grace, Verena offered a steady, courteous reply. &#34;Your grandson is devoted and respectful. I&#39;m sure the woman he marries will be someone truly special.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrie had already braced himself for her refusal to give his grandson a chance, but even so, a faint sense of regret settled in. A granddaughter-in-law like her was simply out of reach.</p>
