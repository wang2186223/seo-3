            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>A middle-aged police officer leveled his gun at Katelyn, eyes sharp as blades. &#34;Don&#39;t move! We&#39;re the police. You&#39;re surrounded-surrender and cooperate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s face drained of color, disbelief written all over her features as she scanned her surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men she had hired to kidnap Verena were already pinned to the floor by the officers. Now, only she and Elmore remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood still streamed from her arm, the wound burning and stinging as though a thousand needles were driving into her flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body quaked uncontrollably; clutching her injured arm, she stumbled back a few steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock and dread tangled in her chest, her breath coming in ragged gasps. Her eyes widened, almost bulging, as she watched police flood in from every corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood frozen, as if chained by her own terror,unwilling to accept the brutal truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How...how is this possible? How could this be?&#34; she muttered, resentment thick in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why were the police here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who called them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind raced like a wheel spinning without end,searching desperately for an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had already been taken care of by the assassin she sent. It couldn&#39;t be him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Verena? She had no chance either-Elmore had confiscated her phone right after she was knocked unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Katelyn&#39;s confusion swallowed her whole, she caught sight of Elmore striding over to Verena,loosening her ropes with swift, practiced motions. The sight made her blood run cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elmore-the very man she had paid generously, who had sworn loyalty and promised to help her succeed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet now...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s lips quivered in fury, her eyes blazing. &#34;Did Verena buy you off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elmore smirked, arrogance dripping from his expression. &#34;Sorry, Miss Fuller. My loyalty follows only the highest bidder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; Katelyn sputtered, rage choking her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena let the ropes slip from her wrists, turning her steady gaze toward Katelyn. &#34;Katelyn, did you truly believe your plan was foolproof?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a scoff, she continued slowly, each word deliberate, &#34;Every move you made was already under Isaac&#39;s and my control. Didn&#39;t you declare that both of us would die? Well, here&#39;s the bitter truth-you failed. Neither of us will perish. Isaac and I will live on, and we&#39;ll spend the rest of our days cherishing one another.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena paused for two measured beats, lifting her chin, her gaze sharp as a drawn sword. &#34;And you-Shoildon&#39;s proud heiress-will become a criminal branded for life. You hired killers, and prison will be your mansion now. Isn&#39;t that a cruel twist of fate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Verena lay bare her ruined schemes and predict her miserable fate, Katelyn&#39;s eyes reddened,veins of fury running through them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, she refused to believe that her carefully laid net had unraveled completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But denial could not change reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every step had been foreseen by Verena; Katelyn had been nothing more than a puppet dancing on strings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would she bow her head and admit defeat?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to find a way to turn the tide, to clear her name at all costs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crooked smile crept across her lips, twisting her face into something both desperate and deranged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For all of Verena&#39;s wit, she could never have guessed that Katelyn had kept one final card up her sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Katelyn thrust a finger toward Elmore, her voice shrill with feigned panic. &#34;Elmore! Why did you kidnap Verena?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,whirling toward Verena, she cried out, &#34;Verena,Kaia told me you were taken by Elmore. I came to rescue you, not to harm you! I was about to cut the ropes with the knife to free you. You&#39;ve misunderstood everything. I never hired anyone to kill. You have no evidence-mere words cannot condemn me. I truly came to save you! If you don&#39;t trust me, ask Kaia!&#34;</p>
