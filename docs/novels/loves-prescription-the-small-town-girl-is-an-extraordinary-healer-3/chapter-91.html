                <p>Stevie Wagner had been rooted in Clokron ever since high school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Cayden and Leonardo Gibson had remained in Shoildon, while lsaac had only returned from abroad half a year ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once upon a time, the four of them were inseparable-bright stars sharing the same sky. Yet now, as lsaac lowered his gaze to his legs, a faint sorrow flickered in his eyes. Of them all, he alone felt out of step, a broken chord in their melody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gathering? Since the car accident, he had avoided every private get-together. Outwardly, he wore indifference like a cloak, meeting curious stares-subtle or direct-without flinching. But deep within, he could not fool himself; he knew he no longer stood shoulder to shoulder with the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac opened his lips, prepared to decline his friend&#39;s invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cayden, reading his thoughts, sighed gently and said, &#34;We&#39;re friends-true friends, unlike anyone else.And besides, didn&#39;t you just announce your marriage online yesterday? Such joy ought to be shared.Shouldn&#39;t you celebrate with those who care for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s brows eased slightly, his gaze drifting toward Verena across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing no objection, Cayden pressed on, &#34;If your wife is willing, bring her along to dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single word &#34;wife&#34; stirred Isaac. The furrow at his brow finally loosened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting his phone aside, he turned to Verena and asked, &#34;A friend of mine is returning to the country this afternoon. Tonight, we&#39;re holding a small dinner for him. They all know about our marriage and would like to meet you. Will you come with me? If gatherings make you uneasy, just say so. I won&#39;t mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated ever so slightly before adding that last line, and in his tone, a cautious undertone lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched her quietly, as if bracing for her reply, yet secretly hoping for something more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena caught te weight of his emotions and sighed inwardly. Time and hardship truly reshape a person.The once proud, unshakable Isaac now wore his sensitivity like a fragile shield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to let this softer side of him be overshadowed by doubt, so she flashed him a bright, easy smile and agreed without hesitation, &#34;Of course-no problem at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac froze for a heartbeat, and then a smile tugged at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, Isaac left for the office, while Verena retreated to the bedroom, immersing herself once again in her medical books.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By six in the evening, Isaac returned to Seraphina Villas to collect her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waited in the living room until the crisp click of high heels drifted down the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing up, his eyes lit ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena descended gracefully, draped in a champagne-colored coat over a beige dress. Nude heels gave length to her step, and with today&#39;s careful touch of makeup, she seemed sculpted with elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lost in my beauty?&#34; she teased, waving her hand in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac caught her hand, and before reason could intervene, the words slipped out. &#34;I want to hide you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lips curved into a playful smile. Leaning closer, she whispered against his ear, breaking the spell,&#34;Careful-locking me away is a criminal offense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard by her comment, Isaac was momentarily stunned before he laughed and said, &#34;I was just joking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They exchanged a glance and both smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As night fell, Shoildon&#39;s streets bloomed with light. In the city center, a restaurant glowed beneath warm yellow lamps, its sign reading &#34;Bronze Rose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, rustic charm met refinement, while bursts of laughter from a private room carried into the hall. &#34;Stevie, after all these years, still no wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been buried in work, you know that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Work? More likely you just can&#39;t decide which lady to bring back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their teasing drew a ripple of laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man at the head of the table-the star of tonight&#39;s gathering-was none other than Stevie Wagner.Clad in a light suit, his cheeks flushed crimson under their banter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked toward the black velvet box before him. Clearing his throat twice, he steered the talk elsewhere. &#34;By the way, what&#39;s the story with Isaac&#39;s social media post? We never even heard he was dating, and suddenly-he&#39;s married?&#34;</p>
