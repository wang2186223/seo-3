                <p>Hours later, sunlight spilled gently across the room,filtering in through sheer curtains and casting everything in a soft, golden haze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena remained fast asleep on the large bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting close by, lsaac watched her with quiet warmth, his eyes lingering on every detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hair was a bit messy, spread across the pillow,and her lashes, long and curled, cast soft shadows on her cheeks. She breathed evenly, lips slightly parted, lost in a peaceful dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, he leaned forward and pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even half-asleep,Verena felt the brush of his lips and slowly blinked awake. Her voice was thick with sleep.&#34;What time is it?&#34; Isaac checked the clock, answering in a low tone,&#34;Just turned nine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still struggling to shake off the last bits of sleep,Verena rubbed her eyes, barely keeping them open.Noticing her drowsiness, Isaac brushed his fingers over her cheek and offered softly, &#34;You got home in the wee hours. Why don&#39;t you rest a little longer?Take the day off if you need it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Verena shook her head, gathering her energy.&#34;really can&#39;t. There&#39;s work waiting for me at the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew how committed she was and could only sigh in resignation, a gentle smile curving his lips.&#34;Alright, just don&#39;t rush. Take your time getting ready.I&#39;ll let Rhonda know to prepare breakfast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned his chair and rolled himself out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Verena stretched and started to rise from bed, the phone on her nightstand rang sharply. She grabbed the phone, slid her finger across the screen, and lifted it to her ear, hner voice rough with sleep. &#34;Hello? Who&#39;s calling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep male voice replied, &#34;It&#39;s Luis. I&#39;ve thought over everything we discussed yesterday. Let&#39;s meet up and talk things through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She agreed without hesitation, &#34;Just send me the place and I&#39;ll be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After exchanging a few more words, Verena hung up and headed to the bathroom to get ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, she joined Isaac downstairs for breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they finished eating, Isaac left for his company while Verena grabbed her bag and set out to meet Luis at their agreed spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arriving early, Verena slipped into her seat at the restaurant. No sooner had she settled in than a waiter in crisp uniform approached, offering a polite bow and asking, &#34;Ma&#39;am, may I bring you something to drink?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She returned his courtesy with a warm smile. &#34;I&#39;d love a glass of fresh orange juice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick nod of recognition, the waiter turned and made his way briskly to the service counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, he returned carrying a brilliant glass of juice, its color bright and inviting as he placed it in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lifted the goblet and took a sip, savoring the sweet burst of citrus that danced across her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Close to twenty minutes passed before Luis stepped into the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He immediately spotted Verena at their designated table, a flash of surprise and genuine pleasure lighting up his face as he made his way over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he slid into the chair across fromn her, Luis&#39; eyes drifted to the half-finished orange juice in her hand before he checked his watch. &#34;You know, Mrs. Bennett, there are still ten minutes before our meeting was supposed to start. I hurried over, thinking I&#39;d arrive early, but you&#39;re already here.How am I supposed to impress you now?&#34; he teased,a playful glint in his eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting her glass down, Verena offered a calm,steady smile. Her voice was all business. &#34;This isn&#39;t a romantic outing, so you don&#39;t have to worry about formalities. Mr. Sampson, I&#39;ll be direct. Where do you stand on the partnership we talked about yesterday?Have you made up your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes met his without wavering, every bit of her posture radiating certainty and resolve.</p>
