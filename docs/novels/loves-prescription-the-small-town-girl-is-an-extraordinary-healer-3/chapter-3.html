                <p>As Verena stayed silent, Kaia added, &#34;The Bennett family might have a good name, but lsaac is already crippled. People say that when a man&#39;s legs are paralyzed, his sexual function is often affected too.l honestly don&#39;t want you marrying into that family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While her words sounded concerned, Kaia&#39;s real hope was that Verena wouldn&#39;t become part of the Bennett family. Even with Isaac&#39;s health problems, he was still someone Kaia had once cared for. And if Verena married him, her life would undoubtedly turn out better than Kaia&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena understood exactly what Kaia was trying to do, so she spoke plainly. &#34;If you don&#39;t like me, that&#39;s fine.You don&#39;t have to pretend you&#39;re worried because...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stopped mid-sentence when she caught the flicker of surprise in Kaia&#39;s eyes, and then continued as if it meant nothing, &#34;The feeling&#39;s mutual. I don&#39;t like you either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That blunt truth left Kaia momentarily speechless. She hadn&#39;t imagined Verena would tear away her false concern so openly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only after Verena had stepped out of the room that Kaia found her voice again. She stamped her foot in anger and snapped, &#34;Who do you think you are? So arrogant! You&#39;re nothing but a country bumpkin from a backward place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had only reached the doorway. Hearing the insult, she turned back, remained just outside, and faced Kaia. &#34;Your parents are from that same backward place. Should I let them know you think everyone from there is a bumpkin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words left Kaia frozen in place. Verena&#39;s sharp, unyielding stare made her feel as though every hidden thought had been uncovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her dislike for Verena deepened. This time, though, she didn&#39;t argue back and stormed off in a huff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia had just descended the staircase when Laura appeared before Verena. A shadow darkened Laura&#39;s expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena could guess the reason. Kaia must have run to her, claiming she&#39;d been bullied by her older sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say to Kaia?&#34; Laura asked, her tone sharp and accusing, as though she had already taken Kaia&#39;s side. It was clear she hadn&#39;t considered there might be another side to the story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such blind judgment was something Verena found hard to tolerate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint, mocking smile, she asked, &#34;And what did she tell you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m the one asking you!&#34; Laura retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her temper spiked at Verena&#39;s question in return, certain that growing up in a rural backwater had stripped her eldest daughter of proper manners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She called me a country bumpkin, so I reminded her that if that&#39;s true, then you and Dad would be bumpkins too, because yo both grew up in the same place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ridiculous! Kaia would never say something so disrespectful.&#34; Laura&#39;s fury deepened. &#34;It&#39;s bad enough you angered your sister, but now you&#39;re making up lies? You&#39;ve got some nerve, Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole thing struck Verena as absurd. Laura pressed her for an answer, yet refused to believe her when she gave it. Was Laura only interested in hearing what matched her own opinion?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena wasn&#39;t the type to back down and had a way of provoking people further. Laura&#39;s refusal to believe her made her say, &#34;If you&#39;ve already decided I&#39;m lying, then so be it. You believe Kaia no matter what. But you won&#39;t ever get an apology out of me. If I&#39;m such a problem, I&#39;ll just go back to the countryside and let Kaia marry Isaac herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew exactly what Laura was aiming for and used it to shut her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; Laura was genuinely provoked, but she held her temper in check, reminding herself of the real reason she had brought Verena to Shoildon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t make sense of how different her daughters had turned out. Kaia was accomplished and sweet-tongued, always winning her over. Verena, in contrast, was unremarkable, stubborn, and dishonest.Years apart had made her feel like a stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get your things together. You&#39;re coming with me to the meeting. And change your clothes. I&#39;ll have one of the servants bring you an outfit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s decision to come to Shoildon had nothing to do with her unfairly biased parents. The moment she saw the news, she had recognized Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t care about dressing up to see himn. So when she came downstairs, she wore exactly what she had on before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura, waiting at the bottom of the stairs, looked visibly unhappy. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you change?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t feel like it,&#34; Verena said in an unhurried tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Laura could only glare, her patience wearing thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on her that Verena was not as submissive or easy to control as she had assumed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, her priority at the moment was securing the marriage arrangement with Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, fine. If you won&#39;t change, then let&#39;s just go...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over in the chat group of the wealthy young people, Bobby kept directing questions at Kaia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaia, what kind of work does your sister do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though they shared the same group, Kaia usually had little reason to speak with Bobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts raced the moment she saw him reach out to her first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting Bobby to feel overlooked, she replied quickly, &#34;My mom told me she works as a doctor in a small town.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby&#39;s brows drew together slightly. Adoctor? If that was true, then at least she might be able to care for his brother. Thinking along those lines, he grudgingly accepted the idea of Verena being unattractive.Kaia knew her mother had planned to spread the claim that Verena was a master&#39;s graduate from Acorith College of Medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia had poured years of effort into getting into Acorith College of Medicine and earning people&#39;s admiration, so the thought of Verena reaping such recognition without working for it irritated her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hint of mischief in mind, Kaia put on an air of casualness and added, &#34;But she never attended university. She probably just picked up a little from the local doctors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? She never even went to university?&#34; Bobby&#39;s surprise was obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The title of &#34;doctor&#34; now felt suspicious to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation welled up in Bobby. Isaac had graduated from one of the most prestigious universities in the world.It was bad enough to marry someone plain-looking, but to have her be undereducated as well...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to keep it in any longer, Bobby sent a message to Isaac. &#34;Please, don&#39;t marry Verena Willis. She&#39;s not good enough for you. Her sister said she never even went to college. Looks aside, she doesn&#39;t have much education.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was seated in a private room at Spice Restaurant, already waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The setting there was elegant and calming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither Isaac nor Danica, however, had the mood to enjoy the view beyond the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Danica, this meeting was purely a business arrangement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Isaac, it was nothing more than a reminder of his own shortcomings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his phone chimed, Isaac glanced at the message from Bobby. His striking features stayed impassive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica caught sight of Bobby&#39;s message as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shut her eyes for a brief moment before saying, &#34;Isaac, please don&#39;t resent me. I have no other option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, the only way to stop the damaging rumors about him was for him to marry and quietly adopt a child, passing it off as his own.Isaac&#39;s lips curved in a faint, bitter smile. Resentment was a luxury he couldn&#39;t claim. In his eyes, he was the reason his mother had lost her husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Isaac sent Bobby a reply. &#34;Watch your tone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby&#39;s temper flared when he read it. In a moment like this, Isaac was still telling him to be polite. Did Isaac even understand the real issue?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that time, Verena and Laura reached Spice Restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena was tall and wearing flat shoes; Laura, teetering in high heels, had to hurry to match her pace.</p>
