                <p>Sherwood pressed against the frigid fire door, brutal metal edges carving into his spine. His legs had turned to water, as though someone had extracted every bone from his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His throat worked painfully before words emerged in a trembling whisper. &#34;I&#39;ll accept your conditions, but thirty million isn&#39;t pocket change. You need to alow me additional time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attacker&#39;s mouth twisted into a malevolent grin.&#34;You&#39;re a wealthy man, Mr. Kirk. If you genuinely care about your daughter&#39;s survival, quit trying to negotiate.Two hours maximum,not one second longer.Attempt any deception and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let silence stretch deliberately before Molly&#39;s muffled weeping crackled through the phone speaker.&#34;We have plenty more creative ideas for entertaining her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ice flooded Sherwood&#39;s veins. His voice emerged as a harsh rasp through clenched teeth. &#34;I&#39;ll meet your demands, but you must cease hurting my daughter this instant!&#34; The stranger&#39;s fingers suddenly clamped around Sherwood&#39;s throat,his voice dropping to a threatening murmur. &#34;Stay calm. Deliver the cash to that steel mill punctually, and your precious daughter remains unharmed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those fingers tightened without warning,cutting off his airway completely. Sherwood produced strangled,choking sounds as his tie twisted awkwardly and dark bruises bloomed across his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as unconsciousness began creeping over him, the grip vanished and oxygen rushed back into his lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood crumpled onto the floor, curling into a protective ball in the corner while violent coughing seized his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands shook uncontrollably as they clutched his ravaged throat, searing agony shooting between his trembling fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the weak emergency lighting, the attacker&#39;s footsiteps receded into silence, his shadow disappearing around the stairwell&#39;s bend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once his bruital coughing fit subsided, Sherwood&#39;s quaking hand fumbled inside his jacket for his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The device&#39;s cold ilumination cast ghostly shadows across his ashen features. His fingers slipped  repeatedly before managing to unlock the screen, and he pressed the call button with desperate force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the relentless busy signal made Sherwood&#39;s chest tighten with dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like an eternity, a robotic female voice delivered the crushing news through the receiver.&#34;Sorry, the number you have dialed is currently unreachable...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s eyes remained fixed on the &#34;Call Failed&#34;notification glowing on his screen, his thumb frantically stabbing the redial button. &#34;It won&#39;t connect, it just won&#39;t...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perspiration burned his eyes, leaving them bloodshot and stinging. Panic overwhelmed his system, causing his phone to slip from his nerveless fingers and crash against the floor with a hollow clang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scrambled to retrieve it, pressing his forehead desperately against the cold surface.&#34;Molly,please be safe,&#34; he whispered through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Molly remained comfortably seated in the luxury vehicle Verena had arranged, listening with rapt attention as Verena shared stories of Miranda&#39;s impressive accomplishments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hidden beneath the leather upholstery, a compact signal jammer pulsed with eerie blue light, effectively  creating a dead zone where no communications could penetrate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s phone rested silently in her purse, its screen never illuminating since entering the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally, no calls or messages could possibly reach her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the city, Isaac waited patiently in his own car,anticipating updates. When his phone buzzed, his fingers glided across the screen to accept the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deliberately disguised voice filtered through the speaker. &#34;Mr. Bennett, we&#39;ve successfully handled Sherwood. After hearing those fabricated recordings of Molly&#39;s distress, he completely fell apart. He&#39;s currently scrambling to gather the ransom and will arrive at the steel mill in twohours as scheduled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following a brief pause, the operative continued.&#34;Mr.Bennett, should we position surveillance teams to monitor his movements and prevent any potential tricks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s fingers drummed a steady rhythm against the window frame as cold laughter escaped his lips.&#34;Unnecessary. We&#39;ve struck him where it matters most. He wouldn&#39;t dare attempt anything foolish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s assessment proved absolutely correct. Upon discovering Molly&#39;s phone remained unreachable,  Sherwood immediately contacted his longtime butler with frantic urgency. &#34;Aiken, I don&#39;t care what it takes,but I need thirty million in cash assembled within two hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Aiken could even begin processing this enormous request, Sherwood had already terminated the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next, Sherwood&#39;s trembling fingers dialed his bank manager&#39;s direct line. &#34;I need access to every available dollar in my accounts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager&#39;s cautious voice emerged from the speaker,attempting to outline potential complications,but Sherwood&#39;s patience had evaporated entirely.&#34;Spare me the lectures! Do it now, immediately! Or I&#39;ll guarantee your quarterly numbers hit absolute zero.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After slamming down that call, he continued his desperate campaign, reaching out to various business associates with the same urgent plea. &#34;I need to secure a substantial loan...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the CEO&#39;s office of Sampson Group, Luis glanced up as approaching footsteps echoed outside his door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting Isaac&#39;s arrival, he moved forward to offer a premium cigar while inquiring, &#34;What&#39;s our current status?&#34; Isaac kept his hands casually tucked in his pockets,shaking his head to decline the offer as a knowing smile curved his lips. &#34;Everything&#39;s unfolding exactly as we anticipated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis rolled the cigar between his fingers, his rich laughter carrying a distinctly merciless undertone.&#34;Perfect. I&#39;ll have Sheppard arrange that meeting with Daren right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon receiving these precise instructions, Sheppard Hewitt immediately launched into action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within the luxurious penthouse suite of an exclusive Ochrerayd nightclub, the atmosphere was saturated with the rich aromas of whiskey and expensive ambergris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daren sprawled across the plush leather seating in complete relaxation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His diamond-encrusted timepiece caught the ambient light, throwing brilliant reflections as he tiltedhis head back and emptied his whiskey glass in one smooth motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ornate crystal chandelier bathed Daren in warm,golden illumination,highlighting how his serpent-print shirt strained against his considerable bulk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Sheppard entered the private suite, he found  Daren methodically cleaning his teeth with a wooden pick,his fleshy cheeks compressed into two gleaming,oily creases.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look what we have here, Luis&#39; faithful attack dog,&#34; he sneered while adjusting his crossed legs. &#34;What&#39;s this?You made my existence miserable years ago, and now you come crawling back seeking reconciliation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four imposing bodyguards flanked Daren&#39;s position,their dark sunglasses reflecting the warm lighting while telltale bulges beneath their jackets suggested concealed armaments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheppard&#39;s throat worked visibly as he settled into the chair opposite Daren.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amber whiskey gleamed on the polished marble surface where a server had placed it, until Sheppard&#39;s palm covered the glass completely,his steel cufflink producing a sharp ring against the crystal rim that lingered in the thick air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Removing his sunglasses revealed Sheppard&#39;s weathered features, marked by numerous battle scars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite Daren&#39;s obvious baiting, Sheppard responded with a sardonic grin, &#34;Mr. Robles, you appear remarkably tense, still dwelling on incidents from three years past.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>References to their history only intensified Daren&#39;s  fury. His massive fist crashed down onto the table with thunderous force, sending crystal stemware and porcelain dishes into a cacophonous symphony while liquor erupted over every rim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The excess flesh around his throat quivered from the violent motion, and pure hatred blazed in his beady eyes as he bellowed, &#34;How could I possibly forget?I showed you nothing but respect, practically begging for a business partnership. What was your response?You shredded my contract into confetti right in front of my associates, declaring, &#39;Scum like Daren doesn&#39;t deserve to conduct business with Mr. Sampson!&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daren&#39;s breathing grew ragged, purple veins throbbing visibly across his flushed features. &#34;Do you have any idea how much face I lost within our professional circles? Who exactly do you think you are? Nothing more than Luis&#39; obedient servant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Completely unruffled, Sheppard methodically straightened his sleeve cuffs with deliberate precision.&#34;Mr.Robles,your recall is impressive, though you seem to have mixed up certain specifics. What I actually said was, &#39;A piece of trash like Daren, who lacks even elementary business sense, has the audacity to fantasize about collaborating with Mr. Sampson.&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifted forward slightly, meeting Daren&#39;s crimson face directly. &#34;Tell me something. Three years has passed, and you still can&#39;t comprehend basic social  interaction?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daren&#39;s rage reached its breaking point as he shot upright, sending his chair crashing backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His security detail stepped forward instinctively,but one piercing look from Sheppard froze them completely in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daren thrust a quivering finger mere inches from Sheppard&#39;s nose,his voice cracking with unbridled fury.&#34;Sheppard Hewitt, you&#39;ve got some nerve! Today we&#39;re going to settle every single grievance between us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His massive torso rose and fell with each labored breath. &#34;But I&#39;m dying to discover how long you can maintain this cocky attitude without Luis here to protect you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheppard brushed nonexistent lint from his jacket, his keen eyes noting the weapon grips barely concealed beneath the bodyguards&#39; clothing. &#34;Mr. Robles, such volatile temperament explains why your enterprises have remained questíonable all these years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Sheppard finished speaking, all four bodyguards reached for their concealed weapons in perfect synchronization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daren raised his hand to halt their advance,his heavy eyelids narrowing with predatory calculation. Understanding the silent command, his men retreated back into the surrounding shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daren suddenly collapsed back against the sofa cushions, erupting in theatrical laughter. &#34;So what if my operations aren&#39;t entirely legitimate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifted sideways, purposefully closing the distance to Sheppard, the stark contrast between his gaudy serpent-print shirt and Sheppard&#39;s immaculate suit becoming painfully obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Years ago,I practically prostrated myself before Luis,presenting him with the finest cigars and premium whiskey, yet he wouldn&#39;t even acknowledge my existence.&#34; Daren paused deliberately, his thick lips twisting into a vindictive grin. &#34;But fortune has shifted,and now I hold all the cards while Luis comes crawling to me on his knees.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He released a contemptuous snort, his clouded eyes sliding toward Sheppard with malicious satisfaction.&#34;The next time Luis seeks my business partnership, I&#39;ll be establishing some ground rules. Starting with teaching certain parasitic underlings who survive on scraps to grovel properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that declaration, Daren seized his whiskey tumbler and emptied it completely, amber liquid streaming down his chin and soaking into his collar creases while his expression radiated pure smugness  and long-awaited revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheppard&#39;s jaw muscles twitched slightly, though he quickly recalled his actual purpose here, forcing his composure back into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers drummed a beat against the sofa&#39;s armrest,maintaining perfect rhythm. &#34;Mr. Robles, I&#39;ll ensure every syllable of your enlightening wisdom reaches Mr. Sampson&#39;s ears.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daren interpreted Sheppard&#39;s response as complete capitulation, feeling immediately vindicated as arrogant satisfaction spread across his features. &#34;So then, what brings you here ahead of our scheduled transaction?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated briefly, barely concealed contempt flickering through his gaze as he added casually,&#34;Surely you didn&#39;t travel all this way just for nostalgic conversation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheppard maintained silence for several moments, his icy stare locking with Daren&#39;s before speaking.been compromised.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant those words registered, the fresh cigar Daren had extracted tumbled silently onto the luxurious carpet below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression froze completely as he stared at Sheppard in stunned disbelief. &#34;What exactly did you  just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheppard retrieved a grainy photograph from his jacket&#39;s inner pocket and slid it across the table toward Daren.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image captured several plainclothes operatives engaged in conversation beside shipping containers at a waterfront location, the telephoto lens even revealing faint weapon outlines beneath their clothing.</p>
