                <p>Isaac sat quietly beside Verena, his hand clasping hers.Her serene face lay bathed in the calm of slumber.and for him, the world seemed to pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes brimmed with tenderness, affection resting there like a gentle tide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was hushed save for the steady rise and fall of Verena&#39;s breathing, Isaac dared not stir: even the faintest sound might shatter the fragile dream she was lost in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At length, once assured that she was fast asleep, he carefully released her hand and drew the quilt snugly around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bending low, he brushed a feather-light kiss across her forehead, as though he were touching the crown jewel of his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did he wheel himself to the door and ease it shut in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he lifted his gaze, Simon appeared,standing guard like a shadow outside the hospital room. Isaac had noticed him earlier, yet in his haste to see Verena, he had chosen not to acknowledge him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Isaac emerge, Simon strode forward.&#34;How is Evelyn? Is she alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some men were simply hard to like, and Simon was one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes narrowed, a glint of steel flashing in their depths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried a chill as he said, &#34;Dr. Moss,you seem unusually concerned about my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word rang with suspicion, his gaze locked onto Simon as if he could peel away the truth with sheer scrutiny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though bound to a wheelchair, Isaac&#39;s bearing radiated an authority that no injury could strip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon, however, felt only contempt. The sight struck him as laughable, and inwardly he sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could a man in such a state dare to posture so proudly and call Verena his wife? It was nothing short of absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy and resentment smoldered in his chest,yet his face wore a polite smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day,he vowed silently. Verena would be his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Isaac-the cripple-before his final fall, Simon would make certain he tasted every ounce of pain that life had poured on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought itself was intoxicating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fists clenched at his sides, nails biting into his palms as he fought to keep his emotions hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a polished smile, Simon answered smoothly,&#34;Evelyn is not only the director but also someone l have respected for years. As her subordinate-and yes,an admirer-it&#39;s only natural that I care for her. Surely,there&#39;s no harm in that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes did not waver; they held Isaac&#39;s stare like a challenge, as though declaring that his concern was beyond reproach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s voice hardened, each word dropping like ice.&#34;Remember your place. She is my wife. Your concern must have boundaries. Cross them, and the price will be heavy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s jaw tightened, but his lips curved faintly. &#34;Mr.Bennett, you are overly cautious. Evelyn seems fine,so I shall return to my duties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned, stepping into the elevator. The instant the doors slid shut, the pleasant mask slipped,leaving only shadow across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica came rushing to the hospital as soon as news of Verena&#39;s collapse reached her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her arms were laden with bags of health supplements,her eyes brimming with concern. &#34;Verena,what on earth happened? How did you faint so suddenly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried to the bedside, setting the bags down with anxious care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must take better care of yourself. Now that you&#39;re expecting, you have to guard against exhaustion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to lsaac, who was calmly peeling fruit,she scolded, &#34;And you-look after Verena properly. If anything happens to her, you&#39;ll answer to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Isaac could reply, Danica pressed on, her attention swinging back to Verena. &#34;Darling,remember to rest between work. Health comes first.You&#39;re carrying more than yourself now-you must think of the baby. And don&#39;t forget the supplements l brought. Strengthen your body, or you&#39;ll suffer later.Understood?&#34; Moved by her earnestness, Verena clasped Danica&#39;s hand and nodded. &#34;Thank you, Danica. I&#39;ll be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gently offered Verena the freshly sliced fruit,adding in a steady tone, &#34;Mom, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll make sure she&#39;s well cared for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s sternness softened into a smile. &#34;That&#39;s what I like to hear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth filled the room like sunlight breaking through clouds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the two women fell into lively conversation, Isaac quietly withdrew to the balcony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But peace eluded him. The thought of Simon hovering near Verena gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could not-would not-allow danger to reach her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting his phone, he dialed Jacob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Bennett,&#34; Jacob&#39;s familiar voice answered promptly, &#34;what can I do for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze swept the skyline, his tone calm yet edged with command. &#34;I asked you to monitor Simon&#39;s movements. Report.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob, ready as ever, replied at once, &#34;According to  my findings, Simon moves only between the hospital and his home, rarely venturing elsewhere...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac listened in silence, his long fingers tapping against the armrest of his wheelchair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The breeze tousled his hair, sharpening the austere lines of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rarely ventures elsewhere?&#34; he murmured. &#34;Besides coming to the hospital, when was the last time he went out, and where?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This morning-at a restaurant,&#34; Jacob answered.Then, as if recalling belatedly, he added, &#34;And he happened to run into your wife there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ran into Verena?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s lips pressed into a firm line. Alarm rang like a bell in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One more thing,&#34; Jacob said suddenly, &#34;Simnon almost never eats out. He orders takeout.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Takeout?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s tone sharpened. &#34;Send me the record of his orders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; Jacob complied swiftly. As the information reached him,Isaac&#39;s eyes narrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The orders came from small, nondescript eateries,many of them unhygienic, unworthy even of casual dining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something felt off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon had once been investigated by/Stevie,who confirmed his obsession with cleanliness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why, then, would such a man consume food from questionable restaurants when better choices were readily available?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppressing his unease, Isaac asked, &#34;And how often does he take out the trash?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob, ever thorough, replied without hesitation,&#34;Every few days at most.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s suspicion deepened. A man who ordered takeout daily yet discarded trash only once in several days hardly fit the image of one obsessed with order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This contradiction gnawed at him. The Simon others saw was not the Simon that truly existed. That tidy,polished image he showed the world was nothing more than a carefully painted facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, what people believed they saw was never the  man he truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the question lingered-why maintain such a mask?What drove him to bury his real self beneath layers of pretense?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even his public claim of being gay seemed to yield no clear advantage,a riddle without an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was fact or fabrication-sooner or later, a test would strip the veil away.</p>
