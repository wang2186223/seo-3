                <p>Once Evelyn&#39;s identity was confirmed, Tobin didn&#39;t waste a second and asked what mattered most.&#34;Evelyn, is there any way you could come soon to start my father&#39;s treatment? His condition has gotten worse, and we&#39;re running out of time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than answering right away, Verena took a moment to think. &#34;Mr. Fairclough, could you send me your father&#39;s previous medical records first? I&#39;ll look them over and then decide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quick to respond, Tobin said, &#34;I&#39;ll send everything right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had the call ended than Tobin&#39;s email arrived in Verena&#39;s inbox.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning to her desk, she opened the new message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena studied Maxton&#39;s medical records with care,weighing every detail before reaching a firm conclusion. Confidence settled over her as she became convinced that the surgery stood a strong chance of success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, she had spent countless hours immersed in surgical experiments, and by now, wielding a scalpel came to her as naturally as breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Certain that she could take on the case, Verena picked up the phone and called Tobin back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the line connected, she spoke. &#34;Mr.Fairclough, I&#39;ve reviewed all the records. I&#39;m almost completely sure I can help your father. I&#39;m still in Akoitha, though, so I&#39;ll need to leave tomorrow morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin could hardly contain himself. The moment he heard her words, he leapt from his chair. &#34;That&#39;s wonderful news! I&#39;ll get my assistant to book your ticket right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone could see how much this meant to him. His gratitude nearly spilled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he not feel overjoyed? He had spent so much time seeking out countless renowned doctors,yet none had shown absolute confidence in treating his father&#39;s illness, and a few had even met with unfortunate accidents on their way to the Fairclough family residence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing confidence from a physician at last brought immense relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If another doctor had said as much, Tobin might not have believed it. But coming from Evelyn,he trusted every word. With a faint smile, Verena said, &#34;But here&#39;s the problem.Your brother has managed to sabotage every doctor you&#39;ve brought in for your father. That means he&#39;s got someone close to you,keeping tabs. If we want to keep things safe, we&#39;ll need to get creative.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long time, Tobin had guessed that Erick planted a spy in his inner circle, though he&#39;d never found proof. He frowned. &#34;So what should we do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes narrowed as she came up with a plan.&#34;You need to spread a rumor-say that your girlfriend from Akoitha is flying in to visit. Let the word slip through your friends. That&#39;ll make your brother relax and keep my arrival off his radar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin&#39;s reputation meant he wasn&#39;t exactly a stranger to attention from women, especially since his wife&#39;s passing, and no one would be surprised by the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After thinking it over, Tobin nodded. &#34;Alright, let&#39;s go with that. Once my assistant has your flight sorted, I&#39;ll have the details sent straight to you. I&#39;ll also get someone to help spread the rumor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft smile crossed Verena&#39;s face. &#34;I&#39;ll count on you for both, Mr. Fairclough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, Isaac returned home after a long day at work. He took the elevator upstairs, and when he entered the bedroom, his eyes landed on a packed suitcase by the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flickered across his face just as Verena stepped out of the closet with a stack of clothes in her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she spotted him, she greeted him with a smile.&#34;You&#39;re home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s brow creased as he glanced from the suitcase to her. &#34;Where are you headed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena carefully folded the clothes and tucked them into the suitcase, and then sat down on the sofa across from him. &#34;Isaac, I have something important to take care of overseas. I&#39;ll probably be gone about a week.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her mention a trip abroad made Isaac&#39;s heart lurch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he remembered right, Verena&#39;s first great love was living abroad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A troubling thought hit Isaac-was it possible that man from her past had contacted her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry came through in his voice as he asked her several questions. &#34;Why do you need to go abroad? Is there someone waiting for you? Can I come along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t try to hide his anxiety, every question tumbling out one after the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena paused, weighing the situation. Taking Isaac along would be impossible if she was pretending to be Tobin&#39;s girlfriend, soshe shook her head. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,Isaac. I&#39;ll have to handle this one alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought for a moment about how much attention the Fairclough family attracted. Anything that happened would likely get noticed by the press,even overseas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worried that foreign media could expose the news about Tobin&#39;s girlfriend, she considered the risks carefully. While domestic attention on overseas reports was usually low, she knew people in the same business circles would certainly notice, and there was no guarantee that Isaac wouldn&#39;t hear about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,rather than keep him in the dark, Verena decided to be honest. &#34;Isaac, I&#39;m going to meet someone important, but I can&#39;t go as myself. I&#39;ll be using a different identity for this trip. Ifany strange news pops up, don&#39;t believe a word of it, and please don&#39;t jump to conclusions. Will you promise me that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Isaac simply watched her, his eyes clouded with too many emotions to name. He finally nodded, his voice low. &#34;I promise. Just be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what he said, Isaac couldn&#39;t quiet the fear that she&#39;d see her old flame-the one she could never seem to forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First loves had a way of haunting people, and that thought lingered as he remembered the small letter tattoo beneath Verena&#39;s collarbone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d once called it the one she cherished most, and the memory only made his heart ache more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting go of something that important wasn&#39;t easy,not for anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Restless thoughts chased him through the night,keeping sleep out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around seven, Verena was up and getting ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she stepped out of the bathroom,she saw Isaac propped up against the headboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crossed the room and settled next to himn,her bare feet making no sound. &#34;Did I wake you?&#34; she asked quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out, wrapped her in his arms, and traced gentle lines along her hair. &#34;I never really got to sleep,&#34;  he said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s mouth curled into a playful grin. &#34;Let me guess-you&#39;re too miserable without me to rest, is that it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Isaac didn&#39;t dodge her teasing. He looked her in the eye, all seriousness. &#34;If I said yes, would you let me come with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question took her off guard for a second, and then she leaned in and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek. &#34;Not this time. I really do have to go alone.Please just stay here and wait for me to come back,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a thought struck her, and she quickly added, &#34;Oh,by the way/, I was so caught up with packing last night that I forgot to mention it. Kaia is staying at our house now. I have a feeling Katelyn sent her, so make sure Rhonda keeps an eye on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of irritation crossed Isaac&#39;s face. &#34;Why not just tell her to leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena let out a light laugh. &#34;Pushing her out wouldn&#39;t solve anything. I&#39;d rather keep her close and figure out what she&#39;s really after.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the time, she knew she had to hurry. She stood up and grabbed her suitcase. &#34;I should get going or I&#39;ll miss my flight. Take care, okay?&#34; She was heading toward the door before Isaac could say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reminded himself there was work waiting and pushed his worries aside, making himself rest for a couple more hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he opened his eyes again, Jacob was already waiting in the hallway. Isaac let him help into the wheelchair, got ready for the day, and headed downstairs by elevator.</p>
