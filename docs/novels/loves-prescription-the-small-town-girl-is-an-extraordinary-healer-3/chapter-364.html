                <p>Verena could not move,her entire body numb with shock as she tried to process Howe&#39;s confession. For a moment, the world faded around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So... I ended up as Laura and Alec&#39;s daughter because of a scheme like this?&#34; she whispered,barely believing her own words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac stepped in and pulled Verena close, wrapping her upin his embrace. His hand moved gently over her shoulder, trying to chase away the chill that had settled into her bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot Howe a look so cold it could have turned stone to ice. &#34;Howe, you and Sherwood will answer for everything you&#39;ve done. Don&#39;t think a confession gets you off the hook. After you sent Verena away,what did Sherwood do next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terror flickered in Howe&#39;s eyes beneath the weight of Isaac&#39;s demand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever courage he had left collapsed. With a heavy thud, Howe dropped to his knees, head bowed in defeat. &#34;Mr. Bennett, after Sherwood had me get rid of your wife, he set his sights on the Sampson family. He wormed his way into the Sampsons&#39; trust, slowly sinking his claws into the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac squeezed Verena&#39;s hand, his grip steady, his voice relentless. &#34;What happened after that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe&#39;s shoulders sagged. &#34;Not long ago, when word got out that the Sampson family had found their long -lost daughter,Sherwood rushed back to the city. He saw you at her side and panicked. He realized if his secrets came out, he&#39;d be ruined. That&#39;s when he dragged me into more of his schemes, trying to get rid of both you and your wife...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe&#39;s words faded, and he bowed even lower,unable to look up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold determination filled Verena. Her hands balled into fists as she locked eyes with Howe, her gaze sharp as flame. &#34;So Sherwood sent you to keep tabs on me,waiting for his chance to strike after l&#39;d cured him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe&#39;s entire frame shook; he was unable to meet Verena&#39;s stare. He nodded frantically, words tumbling out in a faint, trembling rush. &#34;Yes, Mrs. Bennett.That&#39;s exactly it. Sherwood wanted to tie up every loose end. He told me to keep an eye on you, and the moment you managed to cure him, I was supposed to alert his men.&#34; Isaac&#39;s presence beside Verena was like thunderclouds gathering-his face carved in shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got some nerve, Howe Adams,&#34; Isaac said,his voice cutting through the tension like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The accusation hung in the air, echoing in every corner of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe collapsed in on himself, bowing again and again.&#34;Mr.Bennett, I&#39;m sorry-I truly am! I let greed and fear get the best of me. Sherwood tempted me, and I lost all sense of right and wrong. Please, forgive me. I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to make this right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streaked down his cheeks, his words thick with regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena drew in a slow, steady breath, fighting to steady her emotions. Her eyes swept over Howe&#39;s pathetic figure. &#34;Regret won&#39;t erase what you&#39;ve done,&#34;she said, voice cold and unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a backward glance, Verena straightened and strode for the door, chin lifted high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac watched her leave, a knot of pain and fury twisting inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cast one last,chilling look at Howe-his expression promising retribution, just not yet. Then Isaac turned and went after Verena, his tall frame a silent promise of protection as he walked at her side.</p>
