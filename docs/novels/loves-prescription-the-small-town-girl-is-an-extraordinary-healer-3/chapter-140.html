                <p>Danica turned to Katelyn and offered her some advice. &#34;Honestly, I think you should let this go. It&#39;s not that l don&#39;t want to help, but Verena&#39;s against the idea, and Isaac himself refuses to go along with it. I can&#39;t make him change his mind. You know how he is-once Isaac decides something, there&#39;s no convincing him otherwise. I have no say in this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went on, &#34;If he&#39;s refusing your treatment plan, he must have his reasons. Hle&#39;s not the type to risk his own health for no good reason. Since Isaac made up his mind, you should try to respect that. You&#39;re finally home-why not use this time to relax and recharge instead of worrying about this situation? Besides,Verena has a degree from a top university, and her medical skills really are impressive. If not, she never could have pulled off the miracle with Barrie&#39;s illness when everyone else failed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to all this only left Katelyn feeling even more agitated. Danica wasn&#39;t really trying to help-she was just trying to discourage her. But Katelyn wasn&#39;t the type to back down. There had never been anything she truly wanted that she didn&#39;t find a way to get.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure,Verena had that one big win with Barrie, but Katelyn had performed far more complicated surgeries overseas, each one more difficult than the last. That single success was hardly worth bragging about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Dorcie arrived with a tray of steaming coffee for everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a chance to steer the conversation in a new direction, Danica smiled and motioned toward Wendell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Professor Branson, you have to try this new coffee blend we got. I&#39;d love to know what you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her invitation, Wendell reached for his cup. &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll give it a try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brouught the mug to his nose, inhaled the aroma, and then tasted it, giving a slow, satisfied nod. &#34;It smells wonderful and tastes even better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica looked pleased. &#34;I&#39;m so glad it&#39;s to your liking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell smiled and took another sip. Danica then started chatting with him about lighter things. Noticing the change, Katelyn quickly realized Danica was steering them away from anything serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully, Katelyn had no interest in dragging things out, either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She broke in, cutting straight to the point. &#34;Mrs. Bennett, I&#39;ve spent time reviewing all the details of Isaac&#39;s case. What he&#39;s dealing with isn&#39;t simple. I respect his wvife and everything she accomplished at Pine Hill University. She deserves credit for what she did for Barrie. Still, Isaac&#39;s situation is a whole different story.Even someone with her credentials can&#39;t solve this one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met Danica&#39;s gaze without flinching and spoke with quiet confidence. &#34;From my point of view, I might be the one person who can honestly make sure Isaac recovers completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A confident smile spread across Katelyn&#39;s face as she finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing such bold words left Danica momentarily stunned. Complete recovery? So many respected doctors had failed, and she&#39;d never heard anyone speak with such certainty before-maybe even arrogance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doubt and surprise flickered across Danica&#39;s face. Could Katelyn actually be so sure of herself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Katelyn&#39;s personality could be unpredictable, but nobody could deny her talent. There was a reason she&#39;d landed a position at Cloverland Hospital. Katelyn never took on a challenge unless she was certain of her abilities. If she was making such a claim, she must be really confident. Still, Danica wondered where that unwavering confidence came from. After all, the experts who had already seen lsaac were as capable as any doctor from Cloverland Hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica paused for a moment before asking, &#34;Katelyn, what makes you so certain you can help lsaac?You haven&#39;t really explained how.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was aIl the opening Katelyn needed to reveal her connection to Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile appeared on Katelyn&#39;s lips as she asked, &#34;Does the name Evelyn mean anything to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just the mention of Evelyn was enough to make Wendell&#39;s hand tighten around his coffee cup. He let out a long, resigned breath, knowing he couldn&#39;t avoid telling a lie that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion flickered across Danica&#39;s face. Of course, she&#39;d heard stories about the legendary Evelyn,but it made no sense for Katelyn to bring her up now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn could tell from Danica&#39;s reaction that the name struck a chord.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was light, almost teasing, as she continued, &#34;I can see you recognize the name. I&#39;m guessing you also know about everything Evelyn has accomplished? She&#39;s the one behind some of the most groundbreaking surgeries in recent years-a heart transplant that changed the field, and a pioneering treatment for leg injuries. Her work&#39;s even made it into textbooks all over the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica gave a small nod. &#34;Yes, l&#39;ve readabout her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica was more than aware of the situation; she had pored over every detail in Evelyn&#39;s surgical records.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac&#39;s life turned upside down after that devastating crash, the first name that entered her mind was Evelyn, the surgeon whose reputation bordered on legendary. Yet for reasons no one could uncover,Evelyn could not be reached, and she made no effort to step forward. All Danica had to go on were the scattered notes and formal medical documents left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tracking Evelyn down was out of the question, even if Danica wanted to try. With no other choice, she turned to other respected doctors, but none of them were confident enough to promise that lsaac would pull through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That memory made her lean in, her curiosity piqued. &#34;Why are you bringing up Evelyn now? Are you connected to her somehow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering right away, Katelyn calmly tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. She glanced across the table and shot a meaningful look at Wendell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up on her cue, Wendell set his coffee down and addressed Danica directly. &#34;Mrs. Bennett, you&#39;re asking the right person. Miss Fuller is actually Evelyn Rowe. I worked side by side with her in Clokron.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s jaw dropped, disbelief written all over her face. &#34;What are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell knew he was stuck. He never enjoyed hiding the truth, but with Katelyn holding all the cards,he had little choice. A steadying breath later, he explained, &#34;In Clokron, to keep a low profile, Miss Fuller used the name Evelyn Rowe.She always kept her real name private, so hardly anyone knew the truth. I only figured it out because we worked together. She thought you might have doubts, so she asked me to confirm it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As those words hung in the air, Katelyn let a subtle, satisfied smile flicker across her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica turned to her, still reeling. &#34;Is it true, Katelyn? Are you really Evelyn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with Wendell&#39;s confirmation, Danica struggled to process it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always believed Wendell to be honest, and there was nothing to gain by making up something like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the shock faded, hope took its place, blooming inside her like a garden after the rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement flooded her as she grabbed Katelyn&#39;s hand, eyes wide with wonder.&#34;If you&#39;re Evelyn, why did you turn me down when I first reached out about Isaac&#39;s surgery?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn didn&#39;t hesitate. The mention of that old request made her sigh softly before answering, &#34;Back then, I wasn&#39;t in Clokron. My assistant took care of everything while I was away. I honestly had no idea you were asking me to treat Isaac. If I had known, I would have been here much sooner.&#34;</p>
