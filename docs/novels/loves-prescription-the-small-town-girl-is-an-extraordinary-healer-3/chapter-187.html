                <p>Bobby wasn&#39;t having it. Clicking his tongue, he said,&#34;Oh, come on. You&#39;re Evelyn! If that doesn&#39;t count as impressive, then who else could possibly qualify?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned against the seat back, still grinning at her like a kid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking her head in amusement, Verena glanced at Isaac. &#34;Has your brother always been this much of a handful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they were together in the past, conversations about family had never been common between them.With an easy smile, Isaac replied, &#34;He&#39;s been like that since he was little, always bursting with energy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their light banter carried them through the drive until they finally stopped at a restaurant to share a meal before parting ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby went to meet up with his friends, while Verena accompanied Isaac back to Seraphina Villas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, inside the master bedroom,Verena carefully placed the roses into a glass vase on her desk. She adjusted the stems and admired the arrangement for a moment before she turned around and caught sight of Isaac sitting behind her without a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved into a gentle smile as she leaned against the desk, fingertips brushing the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting her head toward him, she asked, &#34;What do you think? Good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes didn&#39;t shift to the flowers at all. Instead,he studied her with unguarded sincerity. &#34;Beautiful,&#34;he said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her laughter spilled out as she teased him, &#34;I was talking about the flowers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking his head, Isaac&#39;s voice deepened with quiet certainty.&#34;I wasn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth in his gaze wrapped around her, filling the space between them until silence became its own language.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena made the first move, slipping onto Isaac&#39;s lap with ease. One arm curled around his neck while the other toyed playfully with the buttons of his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know your charm had grown so much these past few days, Mr. Bennett,&#34; she teased, arching her brows as her finger slid a little lower,mock-jealous.&#34;Tell me,who did you practice on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faint fragrance clinging to her skin pulled at him,tightening his throat. His reply came low and rough.&#34;I didn&#39;t practice on anyone. I only spoke the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His need to explain himself so quickly carried the same hint of awkwardness he used to have before losing his memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave him a playful blink, her voice light with amusement. &#34;Relax. I was only teasing.Why do you get so flustered?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s lips pressed together as his hand moved slowly across her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nervousness gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever it came to her, he could never stay steady. The thought of her drifting away unsettled him more than anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena broke the silence first. Her tone shifted,carrying a weight that made him tense. &#34;Isaac,there&#39;s something I need to explain to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his gaze to her, his voice quiet but firm.&#34;Go on. I&#39;m listening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drew in a breath before saying, &#34;The reason l never told you l was Evelyn right from the start...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words trailed off. A faint sigh slipped from her lips as she searched for the right place to begin.&#34;When I first came back to Akoitha, I stood in that operating room and watched my grandma die in front of me. I couldn&#39;t save her. From then on, every time l picked up a scalpel, my hands wouuldn&#39;t stop shaking.I was trapped by that fear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The impact of her confession tightened something in Isaac&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already believed her life in the Willis family had been harsh, but this was a pain he hadn&#39;t even imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of strength had it taken for her to carry that burden alone for so long?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows knitted together as his arms instinctively pulled her closer, as though holding her tighter might shield her from the memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena pressed her lips together and added,&#34;|was afraid that if I revealed Evelyn&#39;s identity, you would place expectations on me that I couldn&#39;t live up to at the time. I worried that if I failed to cure you,all of your hope would vanish. That is why I chose not to reveal the truth-not because I didn&#39;t trust you, but because I was afraid. But you can be at ease now.l have worked tirelessly for a long time, and I have completely stepped out of that shadow. The fact that I was able to perform surgery on Maxton and treat him successfully is te strongest proof of that and also the beginning of something hopeful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lips curved into a relieved smile as she finished. The pressure she had endured was brushed off lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac cradled her face with both hands, leaning forward until his forehead brushed hers, his breath unsteady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, we&#39;re husband and wife. Whatever comes our way, we face it side by side. Promise me you won&#39;t keep things from me anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words came out soft, yet they carried the urgency of a plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So quiet was his voice that she might not have caught it if they hadn&#39;t been pressed so close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nose brushed against his in a tender gesture,and she whispered back with a gentle laugh, &#34;Alright.No more secrets. From now on, you&#39;ll know everything.&#34;</p>
