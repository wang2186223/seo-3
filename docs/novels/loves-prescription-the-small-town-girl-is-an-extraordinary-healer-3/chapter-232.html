                <p>The traffic light flicked green.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena shifted her gaze from the rearview mirror,tapped the accelerator, and the car glided forward with steady ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Women like her-pleasing to the eye and pleasant in company-were a rarity. Luis&#39; eyes lingered, drinking her in. &#34;You&#39;re beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, eyes fixed on the road, accepted it without the faintest fluster. &#34;Thanks. You&#39;re not bad yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the mirror, Luis glimpsed her composed,unshaken expression-no trace of surprise, not even a flicker.The steadiness of it stirred his curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the women he had known seemed to draw from the same three stock replies whenever praise came their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some wore false modesty, hands fluttering, saying,&#34;Oh, not really.&#34; Others leaned into arrogance,chin tilted, saying, &#34;Of course.&#34; The rest, secretly thrilled,covered their delight with a polite smile. Rarely did he meet one like this woman-unashamed to take a compliment, gracious enough to return it,yet utterly detached, no trace of vanity or pandering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; lips curved faintly, appreciation deepening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was their first meeting, yet somehow conversation with her already felt as easy as breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On impulse, Luis slipped out his phone, leaning a touch forward. &#34;Miss, mind if we swap contact information?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lifted her lashes, shooting him a flat glance in the mirror. &#34;Not happening. I&#39;m married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis paused for a heartbeat, and then the truth struck him-she had taken it the wrong way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet smile touched his lips. &#34;Don&#39;t get me wrong.Not in that way. I just hoped to make a friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had heard that excuse more times than she could count.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A worn-out pickup line-yet she hadn&#39;t expected the leader of Akoitha&#39;s underworld to stoop to such a clumsy one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her laughter was soft, but her words were sharp. &#34;You don&#39;t strike me as a liar. But the credibility of that line?  Zero.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rejected, yet Luis showed no	flinch-no embarrassment, no awkward shuffle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tucked his phone away and gave a light nod. &#34;Then I won&#39;t press.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena offered the faintest smile, nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence settled like a veil over the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,the destination came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena guided the car smoothly toward the curb, and then clicked the locks open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here we are, sir-Nandita Restaurant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis pushed the door open and stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Circling to the driver&#39;s side, he drew a black card from the inner pocket of his coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matte black, etched with intricate patterns, the card carried a regal, mysterious weight-every inch of it a declaration of power and wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He handed it to Verena. &#34;Your tip-ten million inside.Password&#39;s six zeroes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena blinked, momentarily stunned. She stared at the card in her hand, and then back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes said it all, as though she were looking at a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held the card between long fingers, one brow arched. &#34;Didn&#39;t we agree on one million before we left? How should I return the rest to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze remained clear, steady, and utterly untouched by the lure of an absurd fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis felt his admiration for her surge once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled, hands slipping into his pockets. &#34;Keep the rest. Call it a bonus. Think of it as thanks for the emotional value you gave me in the car. Somehow,you eased my mood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotional value? Verena echoed inwardly, browS knitting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t lifted a finger to &#34;add value.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was just a ride. Ten million for a taxi? Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s over the top?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Luis, ten million was pocket change. For a family ruling both sides of the law at its height, money had long since become the pursuer, not the pursued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;Not over the top. Not a fare.The ten million is for you.&#34; Verena&#39;s eyes narrowed, her brows drawing together in a tense knot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time she saw someone use such an indirect method to coax a woman into being his secret lover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a sharp snort and flicked the card at his chest. &#34;Yes, you&#39;re rich. But clearly, integrity isn&#39;t part of the package.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she pressed the button, the window sliding shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car swung round,pulling away fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis looked down at the card lying on the ground,his brows knitting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he been too forward?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swore-once he knew she was married, he&#39;d buried any ulterior motive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the awkwardness barely clung.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her car fade into the distance, Luis checked his watch, and then turned toward the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, in the VIP suite of Nandita Restaurant, Simon pushed open the door. At the head of the table sat Luis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adjusting his glasses, Simon offered a polite smnile.&#34;Apologies. I&#39;m late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis barely stirred. His voice was flat. &#34;I just got here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon seated himself opposite, fingers neatly laced on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No invitation from Luis. No courtesy. In days past, that kind of audacity would have earned broken limbs-if not worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But today Simon showed no fear, for he held something Luis wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis saw through him clearly. Were it not for greater priorities, Simon would already be a memory in the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man like Simon, bold enough to claim an equal seat?In another world, he would have been laid to rest ten thousand times already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis cut straight to the marrow. &#34;On the phone,you said you wanted someone taken down. Who? Show me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Details couldn&#39;t be tossed over a call. And with his mind consumed by his missing sister, Luis hadn&#39;t given  much thought to the name Simon had dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the words, Simon slid a file across-prepared long ago-on Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis flipped it open. His eyes narrowed the instant he saw the contents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tossed the papers aside, voice icy. &#34;You&#39;re asking me to move against Isaac Bennett, CEO of Bennett Group? Do you have any idea who that man is? The weight he carries? Not just in Shoildon-his family&#39;s reach grips every corner of Akoitha&#39;s business world.Even politics-names you wouldn&#39;t dare whisper.What,you think I&#39;m omnipotent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon bristled, fury and jealousy burning hot behind his stare. His fingers tightened, knuckles whitening,rage coiling beneath his skin.</p>
