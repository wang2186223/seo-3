                <p>A mature woman&#39;s voice came through the speaker.&#34;Of course, Evelyn. Say whatever&#39;s on your mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena replied; &#34;I need your help to confirm something for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she spoke, she clicked the mouse and forwarded Simon&#39;s photo to Astrid Joyce. &#34;Could you take a look at this picture and tell me if you think he&#39;s had any cosmetic work done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image was an official hospital ID photo, a standard shot required of every physician on staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Astrid, a renowned plastic surgeon whom Verena had met while abroad, received the photo on the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stretch of silence followed before Astrid finally answered, her tone apologetic, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Evelyn.There&#39;s no way I can say for sure. Cosmetic procedures are advancing so quickly, and there are surgeons who do incredibly natural work. With just this photo, it&#39;s impossible to know if he&#39;s had anything done. The only way to give a proper opinion is to examine him in person and study the small details in his face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer made Verena pause, her teeth gently pressing into her lower lip as a new idea occurred to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you consider this, Astrid?&#34; Verena continued.&#34;If I cover your expenses, could you meet him in person? I&#39;ll arrange for the two of you to be introduced. Your answer means a lot to me, and I hope you&#39;ll agree to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Astrid replied warmly. &#34;Evelyn, I&#39;ll never forget that you once saved my husband&#39;s life. Of course, I&#39;ll do this for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s voice softened with gratitude. &#34;Thank you.I appreciate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Announcements echoed through the airport, flight information repeating in several languages, always in a gentle female voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena waited by the arrivals area in a tailored pair of black trousers and a light beige silk blouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her blouse draped perfectly, the soft fabric hugging her frame and catching the light at the collarbone.The slightly open neckline revealed a touch of skin,while her subtle makeup highlighted her calm and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>poised demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People passing by couldn&#39;t help but glance her way,but Verena&#39;s focus stayed on the exit, her head held high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall, blonde woman emerged and scanned the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting Astrid, Verena walked over with a wave and a smile. &#34;Astrid, I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Astrid&#39;s face lit upo as she hurried over, pulled Verena into a hug, and kissed her cheek. &#34;Evelyn, it&#39;s been ages! You&#39;re even more beautiful now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s smile matched the warmth of the moment.&#34;Thanks, Astrid. I&#39;m glad to have you here in my homeland.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at the busy terminal, Verena suggested, &#34;It&#39;s a bit crowded. Let&#39;s talk more in the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car glided down the road, scenery blurring past the windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena hadn&#39;t spoken yet when Astrid broke the silence. &#34;Evelyn, I need some background on the man you want me to evaluate. What kind of work is he in?Details like that help me figure out how to approach him and whether there&#39;s been any cosmetic work done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena took a moment to think before responding,&#34;He works as a psychologist at my hospital. He keeps to himself most of the time and approaches everything with precision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Astrid&#39;s brows knitted together. &#34;A psychologist,huh?People like that usually have their guard up, which makes them tough to reach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet pause filled the car, but then Verena broke into a confident smile. &#34;I believe I&#39;ve got a plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met. Verena&#39;s gaze shone with certainty,while Astrid&#39;s confusion quickly shifted into understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile tugged at Astrid&#39;s lips. &#34;Evelyn, you have my word. I won&#39;t let you down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matching her energy, Verena gave her a bright grin before telling the driver, &#34;Let&#39;s head back to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Psychology Therapy Room of Evelyn Model Hospital, Simon gave a reassuring pat to his patient&#39;s shoulder, his tone gentle. &#34;Stick to a steady routine after you leave. Early nights and mornings will help you rest and feel more balanced. If falling asleep is tough, don&#39;t push yourself too hard. Try unwinding with calming music or a warm bath.&#34; He added, &#34;Reach out to people close to you. Don&#39;t lock yourself away. If anything&#39;s troubling you, share it with someone you trust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The patient, eyes ringed with fatigue, bowed deeply.&#34;Thank you, Dr. Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon watched him disappear through the door,a small smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the door closed behind his patient,Simon&#39;s entire demeanor shifted. The friendliness faded in an instant, replaced by an icy,almost emotionless look, as if everything before had been nothing more than a performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a sip of coffee and called out, his voice echoing in the quiet room, &#34;Next,please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open at his invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall woman with blonde hair and blue eyes stepped in, clutching at her sleeves, her pallor betraying obvious nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon studied her for a second before offering a gentle smile. &#34;Ma&#39;am, can you tell me your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Astrid quickly darted her gaze away, deliberately putting on a look of fear. &#34;My name is Kelly Mills.&#34; Her voice was slightly raspy,as if she&#39;d been crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon inclined his head and gestured toward a chair.&#34;Have a seat, please. Let&#39;s talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Astrid replied while sneaking glances at his face, examining every feature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing she could confirm from the photo alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now that she was seeing Simon in person,her perspective began to shift.</p>
