                <p>Verena&#39;s thoughts were a little clouded, though she hadn&#39;t entirely lost her clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood full well what Gavin&#39;s words implied.After lingering on the photo for a moment, she opened the chat app and began typing a message to Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her fingers flew across the screen, Gavin leaned closer, stealing a glance. He broke into hearty laughter, teasing, &#34;Well, who would&#39;ve imagined Dr.Willis had such a sly streak?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said this because Verena had embroidered the story, making it appear even more dramatic than Gavin&#39;s original version.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena only smiled faintly in reply to her friend&#39;s playful remark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she carefully reread the message she had drafted. &#34;Isaac, your attitude today really wounded me. I&#39;m drunk now. Are you sure you won&#39;t come to get me? If you don&#39;t, I might just do something reckless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Content with her words, she pressed send-and attached the photo as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing the phone face down on the counter,Verena told herself that if lsaac refused to show up, she would indeed act recklessly. She didn&#39;t mind barging into the Bennett Mansion again, determined to &#34;torment&#34; him with her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, inside the Bennett Mansion, the door at the far end of the second-floor hallway remained firmly shut. The room lay wrapped in darkness. The bed was untouched, and the curtains were left open,allowing a narrow stream of moonlight to spill onto the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the window sat lsaac in his wheelchair, staring into the night with a distant gaze, utterly lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The window wasn&#39;t completely closed, and the cold wind crept through the gaps. Outside, tall trees swayed, their shifting shadows crossing his face, deepening the lonely silhouette he cast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac hadn&#39;t known restful sleep for nights on end.Each time he lay down, memories surged like an endless reel: the sight of his father bleeding after the accident,the weight of his own disability, the torment of his dysfunction, and the thought of Verena-forever beyond his reach. He could only endure the endless nights until dawn, and then bury himself in work to silence the torment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All at once, the phone on the small table beside him buzzed twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At such an hour, he hadn&#39;t expected a message from anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers twitched, and Verena&#39;s image leapt instantly to his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up the phone, and at the sight of her name,his brows drew together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening her chat, he scanned her words, his eyes narrowing at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Below the message was a selfie she had sent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The neon lights behind her revealed clearly that she was in a bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks were flushed, her lips tinged with a deep rose, and her bright eyes blurred slightly, carrying the disarming charm of intoxication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scene struck him like déjà vu-he had seen her drunk before in that hotel, and he recognized that look. By her side was a man, his face concealed,but his broad shoulders and attire betrayed his gender at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word &#34;reckless&#34; from her message rang in his head, and a sharp ache spread across his temples.His thoughts darted back to that night in the hotel,when she had kissed him while drunk. Would she repeat such recklessness with another man?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain in his chest was like a knife&#39;s thrust, forcing him to cut short the images before they spiraled further. He realized then how fragile his composure truly was. Just the sight of a man leaning near her in that picture was enough to rouse a storm of jealousy.If his mind ran loose, he knew he could lose all reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes fixed on the photo, his once calm features darkening, his gaze cold and sharp as if he could pierce straight through the figure partly captured in the frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reason told him this was the moment to step back,yet his heart was deaf to such counsel. Fire burned in his chest, and with a bitter smile, he admitted he had once again surrendered to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You promised me time to think. And this... this is your idea of patience,&#34; he murmured bitterly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consumed by jealousy, he could no longer think straight. His voice broke into a roar. &#34;Andres, prepare the car!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, Andres approached the door, asking respectfully,&#34;Mr.Bennett, where shall I take you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac froze briefly, realizing Verena hadn&#39;t shared the bar&#39;s address.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His throat tightened. With trembling fingers, he hurriedly dialed her number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the bar, Verena and Gavin were deep in conversation when Gavin motioned to her phone and said with a sly grin, &#34;See? It&#39;s working. Amnesia or not, Isaac is still lsaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes lit with sudden joy as she picked up the phone and answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could utter a word, Isaac&#39;s low, strained voice surged through the receiver. &#34;Where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Verena was about to reveal her location,Gavin leaned in mischievously and spoke in a hushed tone near the speaker. &#34;Hey, beauty, are you alone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena shot him a sharp look, while Gavin only raised his brows knowingly and spread his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching on quickly, Verena pressed her lips together and answered, &#34;Yes, I&#39;m alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The playful exchange was the last straw for lsaac. His hand clenched the phone so tightly his knuckles turned pale, his voice taut with urgency. &#34;Verena,where are you? Tell me now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could respond, Gavin plucked the phone from her hand and switched it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; Verena demanded, frowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This,&#34; Gavin explained calmly, setting the phone aside, &#34;is how you force a man&#39;s hand. A desperate bid to win you back. We&#39;ll make sure he never dares push you away again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena blinked, turning over his words, and realized they weren&#39;t without reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the mansion, lsaac froze as the line went dead. A sudden rush of panic seized him, and he quickly dialed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.Please try again later,&#34; the mechanical voice repeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened, his brow furrowed deeply. He redialed again and again, only to hear the same response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in his life, Isaac cursed aloud. The thought of Verena being drunk and exposed to unwelcome advances was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In desperation, he dialed Jacob. The assistant answered at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving him time to speak, lsaac ordered hurriedly, &#34;Check the photo I just sent you. Find the bar. Quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Jacob opened the photo, his memory sparking-he had visited that very bar before.</p>
