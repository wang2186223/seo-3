                <p>Julianna faced Luis directly and asked in a steady tone,&#34;Sir,are you looking for Evelyn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis cast her a fleeting glance, and then gave a curt nod. &#34;That&#39;s exactly why I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping her voice calm, Julianna explained with a professional smile, &#34;She spends her days on urgent and complex cases. Seeing her right away may not be possible. How about this-I&#39;ll examine you first, and then we can decide if she&#39;s needed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis arched a brow, his impatience showing. &#34;So patients here get ranked like numbers on a list? I already told you what I want. Let me make it clear again-I will only see Evelyn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A breath slipped from Julianna&#39;s lips as she realized arguing further would lead nowhere. &#34;Very well. I&#39;ll bring Evelyn to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned crisply on herheel and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The raised voices had drawn attention, and nearby staff exchanged glances as the tension spread through the halls. At the same time, Simon was focused on paperwork when he overheard a colleague muttering in confusion,&#34;It&#39;s the strangest thing. There&#39;s a man outside insisting on Evelyn. He doesn&#39;t look sick at all, just full of attitude. Honestly, it feels like he came here to stir up trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words made Simon freeze mid-action, his expression instantly hardening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting a moment, he set his pen down and rose quickly. &#34;Where is this man causing problems?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The colleague, startled to be addressed, pointed toward the corridor. &#34;By the nurses&#39; desk, right over there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the location clear,Simon immediately strode off toward the nurses&#39; station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Julianna had already gone to Verena&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julianna entered with worry written across her face,her brows drawn tight. &#34;Evelyn, there&#39;s a man outside demanding to see you. He refuses to listen to reason,and from what I can tell, he doesn&#39;t seem ill at all.He&#39;s making a scene, and I&#39;m afraid the disturbance will affect other patients. I&#39;ve run out of options, so l came straight to you.&#34; Verena calmly saved her work, closed her laptop,and rose to her feet. &#34;Alright. Let&#39;s go. I&#39;ll handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, they stepped out of the office and walked down the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they passed through the hall, Verena caught the nurses whispering to one another in low, excited voices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, I didn&#39;t expect someone that good-looking to be so impossible to deal with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He may be a nuisance, but you can&#39;t deny he&#39;s easy on the eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The murmurs reached Verena easily, and curiosity flickered within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they reached the nurses&#39; station and she finally saw the man in question, her steps faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Luis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One look at him told her there wasn&#39;t a trace of illness anywhere in his appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recalling how he had tried to get her contact information the last time they met, Verena fixed him with a sharp stare. &#34;Mr. Sampson,why exactly are you here?&#34; Luis gave a careless shrug, his tone light. &#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious? I&#39;m sick, and I came to see a doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mischievous gleam in his eyes said otherwise,and Verena knew instantly he was here for trouble, not treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened her shoulders, her tone cold yet measured.&#34;If you&#39;re truly unwell, the process is simple.Register at the front desk, follow the proper procedure, and the attending physician will handle your case. This hospital runs on rules, not personal whims. If you keep disrupting the order here,I&#39;ll have security escort you out immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; eyes stayed on Verena, dressed neatly in her white coat. Maybe it was the uniform itself that gave her such an air of steady composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling the flicker of admiration from his gaze, he let a mocking smile curve his lips. &#34;Do you honestly believe those guards could lay a hand on me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena already knew the truth. If he revealed who he really was, no one in the hospital would dare intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She studied him, her expression sharp and knowing, as if she had already unraveled his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Sampson, a man like you wouldn&#39;t waste his time without reason,&#34; Verena said flatly. &#34;You coming here  means you&#39;ve already done your homework on me. So tell me, what do you want? Are you here to pick a fight?&#34; Her voice carried no trace of fear, only a calm challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis fixed his gaze on her face, delicate yet steady,and for a fleeting moment, something almost like reluctance stirred in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t for his sister, he wouldn&#39;t have wanted to stand on the opposite side of this woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bracing himself, he let out a cold laugh. &#34;And what if I am here to stand against you? If you don&#39;t want that,then you&#39;ll agree to my terms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He advanced slowly, closing the space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the corner of his eye, he caught sight of Simon hurrying toward them. Luis, unfazed, lifted his hand with deliberate intent, reaching as if to brush his fingers against Verena&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could make contact, Simon lunged forward and threw a punch. Luis had already seen it coming and slipped aside with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s glare burned into him, carrying a warning sharp enough to cut. &#34;I&#39;m telling you now. Don&#39;t lay a hand on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, he looked every bit like a wolf  standing guard over its cubs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis regarded Simon with a faint, almost mocking curve of his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For all the fear simmering beneath Simon&#39;s exterior,he still dared to stare him down and even tried to throw a punch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single act told Luis everything he needed to know -Verena mattered to Simon far more than he had anticipated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied with what he had uncovered, Luis no longer felt any need to remain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifted his gaze back to Verena, his striking features softening into a deceptively polite smile.&#34;Evelyn, forgive the disturbance. Another time,perhaps,we&#39;ll talk properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving her a chance to answer, he strode toward the elevator and disappeared from sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the air settled, Julianna quickly ushered the curious staff away, reminding them to get back to their duties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon rushed to Verena&#39;s side, his hands gripping her arms anxiously. &#34;Evelyn, tell me you&#39;re alright. Did he hurt you? Did he lay a hand on you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes dropped briefly to his tight hold, as if  measuring something silently within herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With deliberate calm, she slipped her hands free and met his gaze. &#34;I&#39;m fine, Dr. Moss. You need to take a breath-you&#39;re far too wound up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though her tone was gentle, there was a quiet edge beneath it, almost like a test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word &#34;wound up&#34; landed hard, exposing the emotions Simon tried so hard to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His composure cracked for just a moment, panic flickering across his face before he forced a thin smile.&#34;Naturally. We&#39;re colleagues, after all. Looking out for one another is only right, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unease bled through his voice, his eyes betraying him even as he tried to smooth it over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena studied him closely as she mulled over his reaction. When someone explained too much,it often meant they were hiding something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a quiet pause, she masked her suspicions with a faint smile. &#34;You&#39;re correct, Dr. Moss. Colleagues should look after one another. I truly am fine, but thank you for worrying about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ended the moment with grace, turning on her heel and walking away.</p>
