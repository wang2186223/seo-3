                <p>Those few simple words, flowing like clear water,brought immense joy to lsaac&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his head and brushed a kiss against Verena&#39;s chin, his eyes glimmering with a depth of affection that words could never capture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes curved into crescent moons as she leaned down, pressing her lips softly against his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac responded at once, slowly and tenderly grazing her lips as though afraid to let the moment end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The desk window stood half open, and a cool night breeze slipped in, stirring the curtains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that still night, their breaths wove together,lingering in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their kiss, first gentle, soon grew fervent,unstoppable, and carried lower with each passing second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Verena had gone abroad, Isaac&#39;s sex function had already recovered. This meant that they could now have sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very thought made his heart race with a heat that spread through his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as his lips deepened the kiss, Verena suddenly pushed him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac frowned, displeasure flashing across his face,his voice carrying a note of grievance.&#34;Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breathless, she leaned close and soothed softly into his ear, &#34;Let&#39;s go to the bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guiding him with gentle care, she helped Isaac over to the bed and laid him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he rested against the sheets, Verena looked down at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, you...&#34; Isaac&#39;s breath grew uneven, and instinctively, he tried to retreat. But Verena leaned in closer, her nose brushing his,her breath warm and alluring. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Leave it to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her deft fingers slipped to his shirt and removed it in one practiced motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s brows drew together; her skillful ease struck a chord of unease. A thought pierced him, sharp as glass: her first love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had often heard that a woman never forgot the first man she gave herself to. And hadn&#39;t Verena confessed to her friend, just after their wedding, that she couuld not erase that first love from her heart?That memory must have meant the world to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her radiant face, his jawline taut, his eyes dimmed with melancholy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his distraction, Verena frowned, her fingers pressing a little harder against his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nails left behind a faint red mark, searing against him like a brand. Isaac&#39;s throat tightened; every touch of hers sent shivers coursing down his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes gleamed with intensity, her crimson lips curving in a playful smile. &#34;Isaac, kiss me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though jealousy tugged at him, he buried it deep, a faint blush stealing across his cheeks. His gaze clung to her, filled with anticipation and longing. She might never love him more than her first, but she had chosen to be his wife. That choice alone carried its own rare weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s heart skipped at the thought. Following her lead, he caught her hand and pressed it to his lips in a tender kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He resolved to surrender to this moment. So long as she remained by his side, even if he was only second in her heart, he would accept it. Once, he would never have dreamed of bowing so low before any woman. But love had humbled him; and even if it meant vanishing into insignificance, he embraced it willingly. Isaac tipped his head back, a muffled groan escaping his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last rays of the setting sun spilled through the window, cloaking the two of them in a romantic ambiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, they had become a true couple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac held Verena close, warmth flooding through him as he tightened his arms around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes brimmed with quiet contentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Verena released his hand and whispered softly,&#34;I&#39;ll take a shower first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Helping him lean against the headboard, she slipped off the bed and disappeared into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light flicked on, and soon the sound of running water filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac closed his eyes, fighting to steady his ragged breath.She had clearly done this before. His jealousy reared up once more, sharp and merciless-how he  hated that man who had known her first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, he reached for his phone to check the time, noticing several missed calls from his friends, and more than one from Cayden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing his circle well, Isaac guessed the others were calling out of ide curiosity. But Cayden, the only doctor among them, was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Isaac returned Cayden&#39;s call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line connected at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Mr. Bennett, you finally called me back,&#34; Cayden teased. Isaac pressed his lips together and replied with calm ease, &#34;I was busy earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cayden chuckled and went straight to the point. &#34;I called because I&#39;ve learned about everything Verena did abroad. She&#39;s remarkable. With her by your side,I&#39;ve no doubt she&#39;ll heal your legs. At first I doubted,but Evelyn&#39;s reputation is solid. This isn&#39;t empty talk.So rest assured...&#34; Isaac&#39;s gaze dropped briefly to his legs before shifting toward the bathroom door. Delight flickered in his eyes. Verena had promised to do her utmost for him, and he trusted her. If he could stand again-if he could shield her fully as a man should-then no matter what, he would not let her slip away. Even if her first love came back, Isaac would not yield her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed, he thanked Cayden with unusual haste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cayden said goodbye and ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, Verena stepped out from her shower, her damp hair falling loose, her cheeks faintly flushed.She noticed Isaac staring at his phone, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down beside him and asked, &#34;What&#39;s wrong?Who called you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac blinked back to the moment, reached out to touch her cheek gently, and answered, &#34;Cayden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes softened. &#34;What did he say?&#34; Her smile lifted as the faint scent of body wash clung to her, her skin glowing fresh and dewy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to resist, he kissed her cheek before replying,&#34;He said you can heal my legs. He told me to trust you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s smile bloomed.&#34;Of course. But let&#39;s not talk about your legs right now.&#34; She paused, her gaze dropping mischievously. &#34;Didn&#39;t you notice how successfully l&#39;ve cured that part of your body earlier?&#34; The air shifted in an instant, her teasing words steering them back to intimacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahem.&#34; Isaac coughed, his ears flushing red as he looked away, embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena laughed softly, amused at his shy expression,her heart lightened by the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At a grand restaurant in Shoildon, Alec and Laura arrived for a dinner party they had been invited to attend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they reached the arranged table, a cluster of wealthy businessmen rose to greet Alec.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Alec felt both honored and bewildered. These were mnen he had long struggled to invite for even the simplest dinner, and never once had they agreed. Why, then, such warm courtesy tonight?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he did not fully understand their sudden change of heart, he knew better than to question it aloud. Since they approached him, he naturally received them with equal grace. After all, many of his company matters depended on the goodwill of these very men.</p>
