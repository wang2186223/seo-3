                <p>&#34;Evelyn, the hospital is fully prepared for its grand opening, and it has been officially named Evelyn Model Hospital. As per your instructions, the invitations for tomorrow&#39;s ceremony have all been sent,&#34; Julianna reported over the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long season of waiting, the medical team had finally relocated, and now the long-anticipated day of opening was athand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena replied gently, &#34;Alright, I understand. Julianna, you and the team have worked tirelessly during this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julianna, who had always regarded Verena as both idol and guiding star, quickly replied, &#34;Evelyn, what are you saying? This is all part of our duty. Besides, we&#39;re deeply grateful for the generous salary you provide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena chuckled softly. &#34;Very well then. Once this busy spell is over, I&#39;ll treat everyone to a good meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julianna&#39;s voice brimmed with delight. &#34;Truly? Then, on behalf of everyone, thank you, Evelyn!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>6</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news of the hospital&#39;s relocation had already rippled far and wide, and the media were keenly awaiting the exact hour of the opening ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally, the day&#39;s ceremony did not slip past their sharp eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By early morning, the topic of Evelyn Model Hospital&#39;s grand opening had already climbed onto the trending headlines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ceremony was arranged at a restaurant not far from the hospital grounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena stepped out of the car, her eyes caught sight of a red carpet unfurled, its crimson glow.sparkling beneath the sunlight, carrying with it the spirit of festivity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On either side, roses swayed lightly in the morning breeze, their fragrance faint yet lingering. Mostly red and pink, the blossoms were fresh and lively, their beauty enhanced all the more by the striking carpet beneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of surprise flickered in Verena&#39;s gaze. She had never arranged for flowers-least of all roses,her most beloved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in a moment, she understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her head, she glanced at Isaac with a bright smile. &#34;Darling, were these roses your doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her voice, Isaac lifted his eyes, and for an instant his heart seemed to stumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she had to welcome the guests, Verena wore a sapphire-blue gown. Its delicate fabric shimmered faintlyunder the sun, outlining her graceful figure with quiet elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her partly curled hair was swept back in a neat style, the rest cascading over her shoulders. Around her slender neck rested a sapphire necklace, giving her the poise of a swan in still water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she leaned toward him, her radiant face shone with cheer, her words lilting and warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac froze for a moment, dazed, while Jacob, standing at his side, stepped in,with a smile. &#34;Mrs.Bennett.Upon hearing the hospital was ready, Mr. Bennett immediately ordered flowers-roses,specifically-knowing they are your favorite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena hadn&#39;t expected such thoughtfulness, and joy welled up in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, asking playfully, &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint blush crept across Isaac&#39;s handsome features. Though he wore a calm front, he couldn&#39;t help but 自seek assurance.&#34;Do you like them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, he seemed less the composed man and more a shy youth. Verena&#39;s smile deepened.&#34;Of course I do. I love them, especially since they&#39;re from you, darling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped closer, bent down, and pressed a soft kiss upon his cheek before whispering in his ear, &#34;Thank you,my love.&#34; Then, straightening quickly, she turned and moved forward, gracefully lifting the hem of her gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her last words carried a playful, almost musical note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s heart fluttered like a bird loosed from its cage, leaving behind a sweet feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze remained fixed on her retreating figure.</p>
