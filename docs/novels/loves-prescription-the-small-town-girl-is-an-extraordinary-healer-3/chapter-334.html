                <p>Inside the manager&#39;s office, Molly looked ready to explode, her face as dark as thunderclouds and her chest rising sharply with every breath. Her fists pressed hard against her hips as if anchoring her fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes landed on the stack of neatly arranged files sitting on the desk, and a wave of hot resentment rushed through her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a violent sweep of her arm, she sent the documents and folders crashing to the floor, the sound echoing against the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she had received the news in advance and mentally prepared herself for this moment, it did nothing to dull the rage twisting inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena,do you really think you can waltz in here and steal everything I&#39;ve worked for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp knock came from the other side of the door,breaking her tirade. Her assistant&#39;s cautious voice followed. &#34;Miss Kirk, &#39;the new CEO has just arrived at the building.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news forced Molly to draw in a deep breath,fighting to pull her emotions back under control. She lifted her hand to smooth her hair,checking quickly in the mirror that she still looked every inch the composed, glamorous manager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally opened the door, she had already arranged her lips into a calm, practiced smile. &#34;I understand,&#34; she said evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before stepping out, she gestured back toward the mess on the floor. &#34;I knocked something over earlier.Make sure it&#39;s cleaned up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant dipped her head quickly. &#34;Yes. I&#39;ll handle it right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the entrance of Benedict Pharmaceuticals,Verena&#39;s arrival immediately drew attention. The security guard straightened his stance, giving her a subtle nod of respect, while the receptionist hurried forward, all smiles. &#34;Mrs. Bennett, let me escort you upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena acknowledged with a small nod. &#34;I appreciate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped into the waiting elevator, and when the doors slid open at her floor, the quiet hum of the office shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise by the entrance drew the staff&#39;s attention.Some watched out of pure curiosity. Others whispered among themselves. A few eyed the scene with obvious skepticism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena didn&#39;t let it faze her. She strode into the office,looking calm and in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered the employees a small, polite nod.When someone met her eyes, she answered with a steady smile that showed confidence but didn&#39;t come off as overbearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena walked down the hall, she spotted Molly and her group heading toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that talk about Luis, Molly had stopped acting friendly whenever Verena was around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly wore a polite smile, but she kept her distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she got close enough, she dipped her head and spoke in a gentle voice. &#34;Welcome, Mrs. Bennett,&#34; said Molly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly would&#39;ve preferred to use a different tone,but she had to keep things professional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of a smile flickered across Verena&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping forward with surprising energy, a round-faced man broke out in an enthusiastic grin. His voice rang out, warm and theatrical. &#34;At last, Mrs. Bennett!We&#39;ve been waiting for you to grace us with your  presence!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly quickly spoke up. &#34;Let me introduce you. This is Jared Frederick, our deputy general manager.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jared seized the moment, his words flowing with practiced ease. &#34;Your arrival means great things for us,Mrs. Bennett. I hope I can arrange a dinner soon,perhaps with you and Miss Kirk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His usual grin never faltered, and his eyes shone with obvious admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, Jared had little faith in Verena&#39;s actual abilities. In his mind, her success came down to her blood ties with the Sampson family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Luis&#39; influence carried weight. Staying on Verena&#39;s good side could only help his own chances for a promotion or a pay raise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought seemed to animate him even more,his smile stretching wide, the lines by his eyes deepening with eagerness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena held onto her composed smile, but her gaze sharpened in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up on his hidden agenda right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold stare met Jared before Verena replied,her tone steady, &#34;I didn&#39;t come here for dinners or  pleasantries. Let&#39;s keep our attention on the job.There&#39;s no need to waste time on distractions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jared&#39;s grin faltered. He straightened his back, and a hint of discomfort flashed across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to address the team, Verena spoke with unwavering clarity. &#34;If we want this company to move forward, it&#39;ll take hard work, not meal invitations. Let&#39;s concentrate on business and show what we&#39;re capable of. That&#39;s what real responsibility looks like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word landed with weight, giving no one a chance to second-guess her intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether they meant it or not, the employees responded together, &#34;Of course, Mrs. Bennett,&#34; they said,voices falling in line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color drained from Jared&#39;s face. He managed a nervous laugh and said, &#34;You&#39;re absolutely right, Mrs.Bennett. I&#39;ll stay focused on work from now on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly lingered nearby, watching everything play out.The smallest trace of amusement appeared in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, Verena was putting on a show. She believed that once Verena was confronted with the mess behind the scenes, she&#39;d realize things weren&#39;t so simple. Verena swept her gaze over the group before giving a brief nod. &#34;If we&#39;re all on the same page, there&#39;s no reason to stand around. You can all get back to your work now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, everyone voiced their agreement and quietly drifted back to their desks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could you point me to the CEO&#39;s office, Miss Kirk?&#34;Verena asked, her tone even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The title caught Molly off guard. She hesitated for a split second, an irritated glint in her eyes before she quickly covered it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She motioned down the hallway. &#34;It&#39;s at the very end,&#34;said Molly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without taking her eyes off Molly, Verena nodded.&#34;Walk with me. I want you there,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Molly clearly wasn&#39;t thrilled,she mustered a smile and answered, &#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, they headed down the corridor, moving in step toward the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena opened the door, stepping into a bright,spacious room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunlight poured through a wall of windows, spilling onto pale walls and modern hanging lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glossy, dark wood desk took center stage, so perfectly kept it looked untouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A black leather chair sat behind the desk. To the side,a pair of pale gray sofas with colorful pillows brought some warmth to the otherwise sleek space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving with quiet confidence, Verena circled the desk and settled into the executive chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze met Molly&#39;s. With a tone that was gentle but left no room for refusal, Verena said,&#34;Miss Kirk,have a seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gestured to the chair opposite her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not sure what to expect, Molly kept her smile in place,though tension lingered at the edges of her expression. She crossed the room, keeping her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling into the chair, Molly folded her hands and let her fingertips drift over her lap in small, distracted motions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions swirled through her mind. Would Verena start criticizing her again? Would she bring up Luis and insist he never cared for her? Those worries faded as Verena spoke up from the other side of the desk. &#34;There&#39;s no need to be on edge. I&#39;m not here to make things difficult. I just want to get a sense of how things work around here. You&#39;ve been with the company longer than I have,so l figured you&#39;d have the inside scoop,&#34; said Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her own doubts about Molly&#39;s past friendly behavior and her willingness to speak badly of Miranda,Verena drew a clear line between personal grudges and work matters. In this office, only business was up for discussion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of surprise flickered across Molly&#39;s face. She assumed Verena would take time to get her bearings,maybe even try to charm her way into the team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Verena wasted no time. She&#39;d barely taken her seat and already wanted to talk shop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That realization left Molly with a knot of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of it was irritation. Verena&#39;s determination to seize control made Molly feel invisible, like her years at the company meant nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her lips together and gave a slight nod.&#34;If you want to know how things run here, I&#39;ll fill you in,&#34;said Molly, her voice measured.</p>
