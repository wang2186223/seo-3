                <p>Verena nodded in agreement. &#34;That&#39;s for the best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her, Luis felt a tug of sorrow in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was proud of her sharp intelligence, yet his pride was shadowed by regret that she had to shoulder such tangled affairs at so young an age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis reached out, gently ruffling Verena&#39;s hair. His voice was deep, carrying warmth like an anchor in stormy seas. &#34;I brought you back home to be the jewel of this family-carefree, radiant, and smiling each day. Not burdened with these thorny matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, his gaze drifted unconsciously to Verena&#39;s rounded bely. Tenderness welled up in his eyes, soft as dawn. &#34;Especially now, when you&#39;re carrying life within you,you mustn&#39;t wear yourself thin.Trust me-let me carry the weight of these troubles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena understood his concern, but her spirit rebelled against passivity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luis, I&#39;m not one who lives by leaning on others.&#34;Her tone grew firm. &#34;This is our home. How could I turn a blind eye to the family&#39;s matters?&#34; Luis felt a tide of both pride and appreciation rising for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded slowly. &#34;You&#39;re right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with a playful glimmer, he tapped her nose.&#34;You&#39;re too clever for your own good. In such little time, you&#39;ve peeled back layers of the company&#39;s secrets and sensed the cracks beneath the surface.Even I can&#39;t help but admire you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena shook her head, a gentle smile curving her lips.&#34;Luis, this time you&#39;re giving me too much credit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head slightly, the smile brightening her features. &#34;You know my roots lie in medicine. It was Isaac who noticed something amiss with Sherwood and warned me. I merely followed the thread and,after no small effort, uncovered what you see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the shadow cross Luis&#39; face, Verena quickly added, &#34;But don&#39;t worry. Though Isaac knows, he won&#39;t cross into Sampson Group&#39;s affairs. And of course,I&#39;ll keep my own boundaries clear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis chuckled softly and patted her shoulder. &#34;I don&#39;t doubt that. Isaac is a man of pride and standing-he wouldn&#39;t meddle where he doesn&#39;t belong.Besides-&#34;His lips curled teasingly as he continued, &#34;Anyone can see he&#39;s utterly smitten with you.&#34; Then,as though catching a darker thought, Luis&#39; eyes narrowed,his voice sharpening. &#34;But don&#39;t mistake me for a fool to be played with. If Isaac ever dared to betray you or tried to prey upon the Sampson family business, I would not stand idly by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the shift in topic, Luis steered the conversation back, his gaze softening. &#34;Anyway,Verena,let those things rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He placed a careful hand on her belly, his touch light with reverence. &#34;What matters most now is that you care for yourself and the little life growing inside you.I&#39;m already waiting for the day I can hold my nephew or niece.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As their conversation flowed,her phone on the table lit up with a new message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena picked it up and let out a quiet laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was from Miranda. &#34;Sweetheart, help me send Luis a message. Tell him I&#39;m waiting at Serenity Hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena cast a sidelong glance at Luis, who was engrossed in his work, a mischievous smile tugging at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her eyes and typed swiftly. &#34;Why ddon&#39;t you message him yourself? I have no wish to sit and watch your love games.&#34; Hardly had the screen dimmed when it chimed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlocking it, she found herself faced with Miranda&#39;s reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who asked you to watch? Last time I let you off without charge. I was practically a saint.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena muttered under her breath,&#34;A saint? More like a fox.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then,the next message made her raise an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I wouldn&#39;t message him directly? He blocked me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flickered instinctively toward Luis, and then back to the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her attention darted between the man and the screen,quickening with each second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, from the first chime of her phone and her stifled giggles, Luis had been stealing glances from the corner of his eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, seeing her gaze brimming with uncontained curiosity, suspicion stirred in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis paused in his work, raised his head, and cleared his throat softly. &#34;What did she say to you?&#34; Verena arched a brow, eyes gleaming with mischief as she held up her phone. &#34;She said she&#39;s lonely tonight and waiting for you at Serenity Hotel. And if you don&#39;t go,she&#39;ll find another man to share her evening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s actual words had been far simpler-Verena had embroidered them with bold strokes of her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rarely indulging in such playful pranks, she found sheer delight in the little trick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; eyelids twitched. He calmly turned away, but his furrowed brows betrayed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uneasy current rippled through him, unsettling thoughts he could not quite name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a beat of silence, his voice grew low. &#34;Did she truly say that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his reaction, Verena laughed inwardly but kept her expression calm. With feigned innocence, she nodded. &#34;Absolutely true. Anyway, I&#39;ve delivered the message, and I&#39;ve said what I needed to. Luis, I&#39;ll leave you to your work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppressing her smile, she gathered her laptop and slipped out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis pressed his lips together, made no move to stop her, and turned back to his papers. On the surface, it was as though her words were a passing breeze that left not a ripple in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, when the afternoon meeting arrived,he made several uncharacteristic mnistakes with the data.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As dusk approached, golden light spilled through the window, setting his desk aglow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis sat mid-signature when his pen suddenly sputtered and dried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried scribbling on a blank page, but only pale scratches marked the paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning,he tossed the pen aside, the sharp sound echoing in the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back, a tightness coiled in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tugged at his tie, as though loosening it might untangle the knot in his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long moment, silence hung heavy around him.Then, drawing in a deep breath, he pressed the intercom. When the line clicked open, his voice was steady,resolute. &#34;Patrick, prepare the car.&#34;</p>
