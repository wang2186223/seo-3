                <p>Verena was a bit confused. isaac did not hand her the necklace he had kept in the study. instead, he choseto buy her a scarf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena trusted him enough to believe he wouldn&#39;t allow another woman into his lifeShe reasoned that perhaps the necklace had been meant as a gift for a relative.Leaving her guesses aside, Verena rose, moved before lsaac, and knelt down. &#34;Would you mind helping mewith this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; lsaac took the scarf, folded it with care, and wrapped it softly around her neck, tying it into a neatbow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena remained kneeling before him, and naturally, his gaze lowered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they entered the restaurant, Verena had removed her coat, showing a slightly loose sweater beneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she bent, the collar slipped a little, uncovering the elegant lines of her collarbones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as lsaac was about to shift his gaze away, something caught his eye and made him freeze.Beneath her collarbone, close to her heart, was a tattoo-a single initial, &#34;..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>isaac&#39;s expression faltered, his brow knitting</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who did that &#34;|&#34; belong to?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled her mention of a first love, and it felt as though someone had struck his chest with a heavy blow.it seemed she had not erased her first boyfriend from memory.Verena had once confessed they had loved each other deeply Though she had called it the past... if it were truly just history, if every feeling had faded, who would still carry a tattoo carved for an old flame?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping an initial etched into one&#39;s skin surely spoke of lingering affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the truth stood plain-the mark remained, unremoved, near her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she still think of her first love?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac fixed his gaze on the black letter, frozen, his breath catching in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tide of jealousy surged within, leaving him suffocated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anyone had the right to ask about it now, it was him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet his broken body made him feel unworthy even of jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If fate decreed he never recovered, and she had not truly fallen for him, would that not, in its twisted way, be better?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind drifted back, retracing every step of their journey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then a troubling thought struck him-her affection had come so suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were her feelings for him real, as she claimed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If so, why bear another man&#39;s mark still? Did her heart continue to wander back to that shadow?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it not done yet?&#34; Verena&#39;s gentle voice shattered Isaac&#39;s reverie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his lashes, hiding the storm in his eyes.&#34;It&#39;s done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena glanced at the scarf and smiled. &#34;Thank you. It&#39;s beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac forced a faint, stiff smile. &#34;I&#39;m glad you like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chose not to ask about the tattoo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or perhaps, he lacked the courage to do so. Verena returned to her seat, brushed her fingers against the scarf at her neck, and thought of the necklaceshe had glimpsed in the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her curiosity lingered, yet she trusted lsaac had his reasons and chose silence.They ate quietly, each prisoner to their own thoughts</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Willis Villa...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>since the day Slater posted that clarification, Kaia had shut herself inside her room, refusing to step out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>der phone buzzed from time to time, pricking at her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>very call that came was either meant to mock her or to sneer with false sympathy.innoyed, Kaia switched her chat app to Do Not Disturb, but she dared not do the same with her number, forear she might miss something vital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>et every ring seemed only to draw so-called friends eager to witness her fall</p>
                
                
                
                <p>efore she could calm herself, the phone rang once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lready agitated, she tore several pages from the book in her hand, unable to hold her temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he picked up the phone, meaning to turn it off, but her hand paused at the sight of the caller ID.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>was an international call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>drian?&#34; Kaia frowned, whispering in disbelief. &#34;isn&#39;t he in Clokron? Why would he call now?&#34;en Slater&#39;s post came to mind, souring her face. Could Adrian Carter have heard and joined the chorus ofckery?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>... he had been in Clokron for years. He couldn&#39;t possibly be so quick to hear gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>er a breath of hesitation, Kaia answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>vely mal闬寡 鬢釡揄凑oice burst through. &#34;Kaia, guess who?&#34; Not knowing if he was aware of her plight, Kaia kept her composure and smiled faintly. &#34;It&#39;s Adrian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seized the chance to probe. &#34;Aren&#39;t you busy? What made you call?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just got back from Clokron,&#34; Adrian replied warmly. &#34;I&#39;s been ages since we met. Don&#39;t you miss me?Won&#39;t you join me for a meal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of meeting, Kaia&#39;s instinct was to refuse, fearing he might know about the post and wish to ridicule her face-to-face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as she prepared to decline, a spark lit in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian had just returned from Clokron, and he too was a graduate of Pine Hill University.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart leapt with sudden excitement. &#34;Adrian, I&#39;ve missed you. How time flies! It&#39;s been so long I nearly forgot-what year was it you went abroad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian,thoughtful, gave her the year and sighed. &#34;Hard to believe i&#39;s been seven years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia made a mental note and replied, &#34;It really has been a while. Adrian, are you free tomorrow? Let&#39;s meet in the afternoon. It&#39;s on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian agreed without hesitation. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning busyness, Kaia said, &#34;Adrian, I have things to attend to. Let&#39;s talk more tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenthe call ended, she opened her door and walked downstairs, intent on finding Laura to ask something.But as she reached the staircase, voices rose from the living room-Alec and Laura were quarreling bitterly.Kaia halted,listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s voice seethed with resentment.&#34;Verena, that ungrateful girl, is too petty! Even when we begged her,she still refused to come home. How can she hold grudges against her own parents?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec snorted, pointing a trembling finger at her. &#34;This is your doing. You knew she was sensitive, yet you provoked her until she left. Now look where we are! We can&#39;t hold on to anything!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing patience, Laura pushed his hand aside. &#34;Alec Wilis, stop pretending you&#39;re blameless. Every timetrouble comes, you wash your hands clean. Don&#39;t pin this on me. Even if l was wrong, you agreed to it. Allyou ever do is bully your family while cowering before outsiders. Why don&#39;t you go confront lsaac if youdare? lf luck hadn&#39;t handed you a friend to invest with, you&#39;d still be the same good-for-nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec, proud to a fault, could never bear his weakness being spoken aloud, even in private.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s words cut him to the quick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia knew her father well. With Laura&#39;s tongue so sharp, she was inviting his fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resolve flickered in Kaia&#39;s eyes as she hurried down the stairs</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, Alec&#39;s face was twisted with rage. He raised his hand high. &#34;Shut your mouth, you witch!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blow fell swiftly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smack! The sound cracked through the room as the heavy slap landed-not on Laura, but on Kaia, who hadrushed in, her head snapping to the side.</p>
