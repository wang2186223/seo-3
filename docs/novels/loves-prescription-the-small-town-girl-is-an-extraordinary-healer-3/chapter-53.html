                <p>Laura&#39;s sudden change of tone left Verena knitting her brows in puzzlement. After all those years of cold neglect, without a shred of guilt, this abrupt sweetness reeked of suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, Verena recalled what Isaac had told her that very morning. The picture became clear-Laura&#39;s new approach must have been stirred by Isaac&#39;s warning.Otherwise, with Laura&#39;s temperament, she would never have come seeking her out. To Laura,she had never truly been a daughter at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole family was waiting for her? Verena mused with a faint smnirk. How bitterly ironic those words sounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small, wry smile, she said, &#34;Last night, you made it plain you didn&#39;t recognize me as your daughter and told me to leave. Surely, those words are still fresh in your mind. There&#39;s no need for pretenses. What&#39;s spoken can&#39;t be unspoken-you own it, and so do l.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reminder of the previous night&#39;s exchange darkened Laura&#39;s face. This obstinate girl was unearthing past grievances, even after she had ference stooped so low as to ask her to return home. Did Verena expect her to fall on her knees in apology?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,Laura forced a gracious smile, coating her words with honey. &#34;Verena, they say quarrels between mother and daughter never last. Look, even when you struck my hand,I never took it to heart. Why cling to trifles? They were words said in anger, nothing mnore ...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena answered with a soft chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura mistook it for yielding and felt a swell of triumph.As she thought, Verena feared abandonment; a few kind words, and she was halfway convinced. All their fretting had been needless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her joy was short-lived. Verena&#39;s smile faded,her voice cutting cold. &#34;I never regret my words. While it may be true that grudges between mother and daughter should not linger, in my eyes, you lost the right to be my mother long ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, Verena closed the door.Years of disappointment had eroded her patience.Besides, Laura&#39;s sudden visit was no act of concern-it was simply spurred by Isaac&#39;s warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heavy thud of the door slamming shut struck Laura like a slap across the face. Wait-was this... a refusal to return to the Willis family home?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her features twisted with fury, her simmering anger now blazing. In her mind, it was always the child who sought forgiveness from the parent, never the other way around. She had already lowered herself by coming here, yet Verena dared to show her such disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething, Laura pounded on the door and shouted,&#34;Open the door, Verena! Open it now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena,unmoved,ignored the storm outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With silence behind the door, Laura&#39;s temper boiled over. She struck it again and threatened fiercely,&#34;Have you forgotten the marriage alliance with the Bennett family? Do you not wish to marry lsaac and live a life of comfort? Isaac may care only for you,but his mother won&#39;t. If you&#39;re no daughter of the Willis family, she&#39;ll never agree! Go back now-there&#39;s still a chance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with the hotel&#39;s soundproof walls, Laura&#39;s shrill voice pierced through, revealing the depth of her agitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unruffled, Verena lifted the receiver and called the front desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, how may I help you?&#34; came a sweet voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena answered calmly, &#34;There&#39;s someone outside my door causing a disturbance. Could you please take care of it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Certainly, we&#39;ll be right there,&#34; the staff member replied courteously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena thanked her and ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, hotel security arrived. Laura, hoarse from yelling,was approached by a young woman in uniform.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am, we&#39;ve had a complaint about a disturbance.Please leave at once,&#34; she said,gesturing to the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s brows knitted. A complaint? No doubt from that ungrateful girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She longed to retort, but her eyes caught the two burly guards standing behind the young woman.Clearly, they were not to be trifled with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swallowing nervously, Laura cast a venomous glare at the closed door, as though she couldpierce through and strike Verena down with her stare. That insolent brat had the upper hand this time!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know who I am? How dare you try to throw me out?&#34; she barked, clinging to her Willis status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the young woman, smiling politely, replied,&#34;No matter who you are, if you disturb our guests, you must leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing defiance was unwise, and fearing the guards might actually drag her away, Laura turned and left,her pride bleeding into silent rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, the corridor grew quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena leaned back in her chair, staring up at the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What exactly had Isaac said to provoke Laura&#39;s visit?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could only guess, but the Willis family always put their interests first. Isaac must have warned them with sharp words, threatening their standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of Isaac shielding her brought a soft smile to her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her phone and sent him a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning innocence, she typed, &#34;Laura came to reconcile today,wanting me back home. Did you say something to them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his office, Isaac was reviewing Willis Group&#39;s business reports when his screen lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at it, saw Verena&#39;s message,and without hesitation replied, &#34;Yes, I gave them a warning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lying on her bed, Verena broke into a wide grin at his candid admission. She loved that mix of seriousness and hidden shyness in him, so she decided to tease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of typing, she sent a playful voice message,her tone laced with charm. &#34;Sharing a night together makes a difference, doesn&#39;t it? You&#39;re already standing up for your fiancée.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words-sharing a night together-slipped out softly, tinged with coquettish delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac listened, and his heartbeat thundered in his chest.His ears turned crimson. Though nothing truly intimate had happened, last night&#39;s closeness had been charged enough to set histhoughts ablaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her teasing was too vivid,difficult not to picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed his lips together, steadying himself,and then recorded a reply, his tone restrained. &#34;If you ever need anything, you can always come to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, worried she might misunderstand,he hastily added, &#34;Not because of last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing his hurried clarification, Verena burst into Laughter. Shy yet stubbornly dignified, he was undeniably endearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at the clock, she noticed it was nearly lunchtime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tapped and sent him a video call request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, seeing her avatar pop up, froze for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reflexively, he adjusted his tie before accepting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the video connected, their eyes locked. Silence hung between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena studied him, waiting to see if he would break it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac,however, was still caught on her earlier teasing,momentarily tongue-tied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, he cleared his throat and spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; He paused, gathering composure. &#34;Did you want to talk about something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the screen, Verena noticed the faint curve at the corner of his lips. He was pleased, but still trying to mask it under his stern facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow arched slightly-she hadn&#39;t realized he had this side to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relaxing back, she twirled a strand of hair around her finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing in particular,&#34; she replied lazily, her voice dipped in playful lilt. &#34;I just wanted to see whether my stern fiancé blushes when I tease him.&#34;</p>
