                <p>VeE ,Mally&#39;e vnica broko through the silence like 目 wltsaRd confessian， instantly transforming the Eār&#39;s ātlogphēre,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verera&#39;s attention shifted at the sound, finding Molly with her ehin tueked low, fingers anxiously working the fabFie of her shirt inte tiny wrinkles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than Bressing fer details, Verena simply waited with patient understanding for Mally to find her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several heartbeats passed before Molly finally raised her eyes. &#34;Do y8H honestly think I&#39;m not worthy of Luis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That thought has never crossed my mind,&#34; Verena&#39;s response came without hesitatien:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her steady gaze locked with Mally&#39;s troubled eyes,radiating both warmth and unwavering conviction.&#34;More importantly, when love enters the pieture,worthiness becomes completely irrelevant. Elther the feelings exist or they don&#39;t. All the rest ls just noise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unexpected wisdom hit Molly like a physieal blow.fresh moisture gathering in her eyes as Verena&#39;s brutal honesty cut straight to her heart: Her lips parted, throat constricting with bitter recognition, words scraping out like broken glass. &#34;So Luis doesn&#39;t feeL anything for me, does he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s mouth formed a tight line, choosing silence over cruel confirmation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly recognized that sometimes the absence of words spoke volumes. Deep down,she&#39;d been seeking validation for something she already understood perfectly, though her heart remained stubbornly resistant to accepting the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about Miranda then?&#34; Molly&#39;s voice emerged raw and damaged, like vocal cords dragged across concrete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion flickered across Verena&#39;s features,eyebrows drawing together slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before any response could form, Molly collapsed backward into her seat, staring at the car&#39;s ceiling with hollow,defeated eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does Luis have romantic feelings for Miranda?&#34; The question tumbled out in barely a whisper, tear-dampened lashes casting shadows on her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as she spoke, vivid memories flooded back of witnessing Luis and Miranda emerge from that hotel together, their shared smiles radiating obvious intimacy.Excruciating pain sliced through her ribcage,throat closing around a knot of anguish that made every inhale feel like swallowing razor blades.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s gaze dropped to Molly&#39;swhite-knuckled fists,still bearing angry red crescents where her nails had bitten deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy sigh built in Verena&#39;s chest, though she managed to suppress it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following a prolonged pause, she finally spoke. &#34;I honestly have no idea about that situation. I can&#39;t offer you any certainties.However,after knowing him for all these years, you must understand his character better than anyone-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words faded into nothing as Molly&#39;s head turned toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant their eyes connected, Verena witnessed the devastating heartbreak swimming in Molly&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luis has never been the type to lead anyone on.When someone manages to get close to him...&#34;Verena&#39;s tone grew quieter, though every syllable still reached Molly with crystal clarity. &#34;There&#39;s always something genuínely special about them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite Verena&#39;s careful attempt to soften the blow,her diplomatic phrasing couldn&#39;t mask the brutal truth. The message hit its target regardless, and Molly understood perfectly. Her teeth sank into her bottom lip as crushing weight settled across her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me about Miranda. What kind of woman is she?&#34;The question emerged with Molly&#39;s eyes fixed on Verena,burning with a volatile mixture of raw jealousy and reluctant fascination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, Miranda stirred intense envy within her,while simultaneously commanding her grudging respect</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harsh overhead lighting carved deep shadows beneath Molly&#39;s eyes, her tear-streaked makeup telling the story of her exhaustion and heartbreak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity battled against her desperate denial,the same torturous question that had haunted her through countless sleepless nights. Years of silent devotion had been poured into loving Luis, endless attempts to breach the walls around his heart, yet he&#39;d remained completely unmoved by her efforts. Meanwhile,Miranda had somehow slipped past every defense and claimed residence in his heart within a short time.Where exactly did she fall short compared to Miranda?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s expression remained perfectly composed as she brushed an errant strand of hair behind her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s stubborn refusal to accept reality couldn&#39;t have been more obvious, drawing another gentle sigh from Verena&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping Molly distracted was essential to buy lsaac the time he needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that goal in mind, Verena settled into her narrative. &#34;My first encounter with Miranda happened back at school...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.·.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier,while Molly disappeared into the dressing room to change into the work uniform, Verena had already fired off a quick text to Isaac, confirming her success in keeping Molly completely occupied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Isaac&#39;s phone buzzed with the message,he sank deeper into the plush leather seat of his black car, elegant fingers dancing across the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call connected, his voice carried arctic authority. &#34;Move forward with the plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that very moment, inside an upscale restaurant in Ochrerayd, Sherwood was playing the gracious host to his dinner companions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through the evening&#39;s festivities,alcohol had left him pleasantly buzzed without crossing into complete intoxication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising from his seat, he excused himself and navigated away from their private dining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The overhead fixtures seemed to sway and blur through Sherwood&#39;s alcohol-hazed vision. His fingers worked to loosen his constricting tie as he stumbled toward the men&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His footsteps created muffled impressions against the thick carpeting until something abruptly shattered the rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s spine crashed against the frigid metal framework of an emergency exit, never catching even a glimpse of his attacker&#39;s identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cloth reeking of harsh chemicals clamped over his mouth and nose with violent efficiency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The metallic click of the emergency door&#39;s lock engaging echoed through the narrow space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s body responded with desperate thrashing,but iron-strong fingers seized his suit jacket, his skull connecting brutally with the fire door as brilliant explosions of light burst behind his eyelids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For one precious moment, his airways cleared,allowing him to bellow his fury. &#34;Release me this instant! Do you have any idea who you&#39;re dealing with...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your precious daughter is currently in my possession.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stranger&#39;s tobacco-roughened voice sliced through Sherwood&#39;s threats with chilling efficiency.&#34;Thirty million in cold cash. The abandoned steel mill near Horizon Bridge. Two hours from now. If you dare call the police-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stranger let silence stretch deliberately before delivering his vicious threat. &#34;That pretty girl won&#39;t be returning home in one piece.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s throat worked twice as he swallowed hard,fighting to regain his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know who I am?&#34; His voice carried the commanding presence forged through decades of corporate warfare, though a slight tremor betrayed his growing fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s mind raced beneath his controlled exterior. This wasn&#39;t some random street crime. The attacker knew exactly who he was and had deliberately targeted his most vulnerable point. Was this an orchestrated plan or an opportunistic grab?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thoughts churned violently through his head, but he kept his expression neutral, studying the shadowy figure for any weakness or hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the emergency corridor&#39;s weak lighting, the man&#39;s crouched form threw distorted shadows across the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the dim glow, Sherwood could see his captor  wore tattered clothes, looking like any homeless drifter from the city streets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man released a mocking laugh. &#34;Mr. Kirk, if I didn&#39;t know who you were, why would I risk demanding thirty million upfront? Everyone in business circles knows about your ruthless reputation. But if you want your daughter alive, you&#39;ll do exactly what I say. Otherwise,she gets cut up and dumped in the river.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain hammered through Sherwood&#39;s temples as he dug his nails deep into his palms, using the sharp sensation to control his shaking body. The alcohol had completely burned off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed down the terror clawing up his throat and let out a contemptuous sound. &#34;You&#39;re lying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood needed to confirm whether this was actually real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment those words left his mouth,the man&#39;s sneer deepened as he pulled out a phone and dialed a number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call connected, Sherwood heard Molly&#39;s panicked voice crying out, &#34;Dad, save me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man spoke calmly into the phone. &#34;Mr. Kirk doesn&#39;t quite believe us yet. Give him better proof.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the horrifying sounds from the other end: the wet slice of a blade cutting flesh and the sharp snap of breaking bone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s scream hit Sherwood like a dagger straight through his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man pressed the phone against Sherwood&#39;s ear,grinning as he spoke. &#34;Hear that clearly? Mr. Kirk, if you&#39;re still doubting me, her wrist is next.&#34;</p>
