                <p>Seeing that Verena seemed to know her place,Erick shot her a sideways look. &#34;Glad you get how things work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inwardly, he scoffed at himself for ever being suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He figured women like her were just chasing wealth and had no reason to hide anything deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All it took was a small reward to keep them happy-and they were never any real trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Erick&#39;s doubts behind them, Verena and Tobin headed to the hospital for another visit with Maxton the next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They sat side by side at his bedside. As Verena leaned in for an exam, lifting her hand as if to check Maxton&#39;s eyes, she caught the sensation of being watched through the glass panel on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked down and changed course, resting her palm gently on Maxton&#39;s shoulder instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She deliberately raised her voice, her tone full of regret. &#34;I always heard stories about Mr. Maxton Fairclough&#39;s business success, but never expected to meet him like this. He has such a kind look-what a shame, for someone so good to end up here. I hope he wakes up soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin didn&#39;t understand why she suddenly sounded so sentimental, but when he caught her glance, he realized there was an audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He played along, giving her shoulder a reassuring squeeze. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Dad&#39;s strong. I&#39;m sure when he finally wakes up and meets you, he&#39;ll be thrilled to have you join the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From outside, Britton listened to the exchange, some of his earlier suspicions slipping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped inside,letting the door close behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing someone enter,both Tobin and V/erena turned to see who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Britton walked over with an easy smile and said casually, &#34;Mr. Fairclough, I&#39;ve noticed you&#39;ve been coming to the hospital quite often these past few days. It&#39;s clear you care deeply about your father&#39;s condition. If he were aware of this,he would surely feel comforted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin placed a gentle arm around Verena. &#34;Before he got sick, Dad always told me to move forward and build a new life. Now that I&#39;ve found someone, I bring her to see him. I hope hearing our voices will bring him back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Britton gave Verena a quick glance, catching the shy smile she offered, and then nodded. &#34;With so much love around him, I bet your father will pull through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin managed a hopeful smile. &#34;We can only wait and see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Britton&#39;s eyes lingered on Maxton before he spoke again. &#34;It&#39;s important not to overstay during each visit.Too much excitement could slow your father&#39;s recovery.So,Mr.Fairclough-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of realization crossed Verena&#39;s face. Britton&#39;s rush to send them off spoke volumes; she pegged him for one of Erick&#39;s people almost instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No real doctor would lurk outside just to eavesdrop on the family&#39;s conversations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin gave a polite nod. &#34;Dr. Smith, I&#39;m trusting my father to your care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Britton kept his professional smile. &#34;Of course, that&#39;s my responsibility.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Tobin and Verena headed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked, Verena slipped her arm through his  and spoke in a low voice meant just for him. &#34;That doctor works for Erick. We&#39;ll need to steer clear of him when it&#39;s time for surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin turned,stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t realized he&#39;d let one of his brother&#39;s men get so close to their father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought sent a chill through him. Without his decision to put security cameras everywhere, Erick might&#39;ve already tried something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although anger simmered beneath the surface, Tobin maintained a gentle facade for the prying eyes and kept his voice light. &#34;So what should we do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lowered her eyes and played the part of a bashful girlfriend, answering softly, &#34;Let&#39;s get back to your room. I&#39;ll tell you thee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, the gardeners spotted the two huddled close and assumed it was just another sweet couple moment. They wisely chose to stay away and give them privacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were back in Tobin&#39;s suite,Verena wasted no time. &#34;Did you already arrange for the equipment and the surgical team I&#39;ll need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin already understood why she had come and had taken steps in advance. He had told his assistant to  prepare everything and deliver it. &#34;They&#39;re on their way now; it won&#39;t take long,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had the words left his mouth than a knocking sound came at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two looked at each other briefly before Tobin called out, &#34;Who&#39;s there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice replied from the hallway, &#34;Mr. Fairclough, it&#39;s Javier. I brought the documents from your office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made sure to stress the word &#34;documents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin nodded. &#34;Just leave them in my study, thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Javier walked away, Tobin turned to Verena, excitement shining in his eyes. &#34;Everything&#39;s set for the surgery now. All that&#39;s left is to actually do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena spoke up. &#34;We have to deal with Dr. Smith first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for her small medical kit and pulled out a thin, silver needle. &#34;I&#39;ll put you to sleep with this.Once you&#39;re out, I&#39;ll call Dr. Smith in as a distraction and slip away to your father&#39;s room for the operation.The effect wears off pretty fast, so when you wake up,you need to keep him busy no matter what. Stall for as long as you can, and don&#39;t let him leave until I get back.&#34; Tobin&#39;s eyes fell on the silver needle she held, and with firm resolve he said, &#34;I understand you. I&#39;ll make sure to buy enough time for my father&#39;s care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena guided him onto the bed, and once he was settled, she started inserting the needle into his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within minutes, Tobin was fast asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stashed her medical kit and hurried toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her rushed footsteps drew a servant, who stopped her with a worried look. &#34;Miss Willis, is something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gripped the woman&#39;s shoulder, her voice urgent. &#34;Find Dr. Smith-quickly! Tobin just lost consciousness. Go get him, now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;I&#39;ll fetch him right away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bolted off toward the hospital wing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short while later, Britton showed up with his medical kit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned forward slightly and asked, &#34;How are things looking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears brimming in her eyes, Verena shook her head.&#34;I have no idea. We just finished a walk outside, and as soon as we got back, he collapsed. Dr. Smith, please help him-check on Tobin!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Britton remarked, &#34;I&#39;ll need everyone to step out.I have to check on Mr. Fairclough alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waited for the room to clear, and then closed the door behind him, leaving the others lingering in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the crowd distracted, Verena used the commotion to quietly slip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving quickly, she made her way toward the hospital wing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick got word and rushed home from the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite any issues he had with Tobin, family drama called for a united front when it mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He climbed the stairs to Tobin&#39;s room and found the door shut tight. Turning to a nearby staff member,he asked, &#34;What&#39;s happening in there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant replied with careful respect, &#34;Dr. Smith is inside checking on your brother. We&#39;re waiting out here for news,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick&#39;s eyes scanned the area, searching for any sign of Tobin&#39;s girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown creased his face as he asked, &#34;So only my brother and Dr. Smith are in there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant gave a firm nod. &#34;That&#39;s correct.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of realization hit Erick, and his expression hardened. Without another word, he spun around and hurried toward the hospital. The moment he reached the stairwell, a wall of Tobin&#39;s bodyguards stepped into his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognizing their faces, Erick&#39;s voice rose in anger.&#34;You&#39;re blocking me? My father&#39;s in danger, and there&#39;s a threat in this house. If something goes wrong,it&#39;ll be on your heads. Move!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the bodyguards stood their ground, showing no sign of backing down.</p>
