                <p>Luis narrowed his long eyes, a trace of indulgence flickering before he swiftly veiled it. &#34;Miss Brown,aren&#39;t you weary of playing the same card over and over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone carried the lilt of teasing, yet it bore no sting of sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda caught the pretense of calm on his face,amusement bubbling quietly in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she reached for the wine glass in his hand, letting her fingertips brush deliberately across the back of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis pressed his lips together, a tingling wave coursing through his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised the red wine to her lips, the liquid glossing them,lending her an air even more enchanting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting her head, she blinked slowly and flashed a triumphant smile.&#34;The bait always works on the willing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; gaze lingered on her, her cheeks prettily flushed from the alcohol. For an instant, his mind strayed back to the night they first crossed paths in that hotel corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He steadied himself, speaking again, his voice turning hoarse. &#34;You&#39;re drunk, not thinking straight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda chuckled, set the glass down,and without pause sank onto his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis stiffened instinctively, but her palm pressed lightly against his chest, halting him mid-motion-a gentle shove that sent him reclining back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned closer,her hair brushing his cheek, a subtle spark crawling over his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luis, I&#39;m perfectly clearheaded now, just as I was last time.&#34; Her whisper hovered at his ear, as though spilling secrets meant for no one else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her bewitching eyes held him fast, filled with a challenge veiled in seduction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the day still burned outside, the curtains were drawn, and only a lone floor lamp bathed the room in its amber glow, wrapping them in a cocoon of warmth and privacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air thickened, heavy with heat, as though the atmosphere itself caught fire. Luis locked eyes with her, his stare unreadable and deep as still water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said nothing, simply watched her, jasmine lacing the air between them, his breath uneven, a surge of heat coursing through his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,with undeniable force, he leaned forward and claimed her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the wide king-size bed, Miranda lay languid, her hair fanned across the pillow like seaweed drifting on a tide, her cheeks still faintly stained with blush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her throat dry, she nudged the man beside her.&#34;I need some water.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was husky, carrying the air of a spoiled princess issuing a command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis heard her, rose without a word, and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh from the bathroom, his upper body was bare,muscles taut, a towel slung around his waist, every movement betraying the sharp lines of his V-shaped abs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He returned with a glass of warm water and held it out to Miranda. Too lazy to move, she drank directly from the glass still in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Want more?&#34; Luis asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda shook her head, sinking back, her gaze wandering over him-broad shoulders, narrow waist,and eight-pack abs. Born to privilege, blessed with talent, and above all, dangerously handsome-he was the kind of man women called a prize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head, a sly smile curving her lips, eyes sparkling like a fox with a secret. &#34;Luis, I want to change the condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was feather-light, teasing. &#34;Instead of being my bed partner, why not be my boyfriend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis was just about to set the glass down when her words halted him mid-motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused,catching the playful lilt in her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing the glass aside, he leaned back against the headboard,reached for the pack of cigarettes on the bedside table, and pulled one free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a click, the lighter flared blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing his eyes, he lit the cigarette, drew deeply,and exhaled-white smoke drifting to shroud his face like a curtain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You never say what you mean,&#34; he murmured, his voice low and rasped, thick with restraint. &#34;Today, it was mutual consent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated, and then gave a wry chuckle. &#34;If I ever let myself care, you&#39;d strip me clean-down to the bone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s composure barely wavered, though her tone grew faintly rigid. &#34;What do you mean? I&#39;m a good person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis neither agreed nor denied, his eyes steady on her,tinged with scrutiny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, he stubbed out the cigarette. &#34;A bed partner works fine; I happen to need one. Will you take the role?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s brows shot up, eyes widening. What was this turn of events? The script had flipped entirely. She had planned to reel him in, yet here she was, the one caught in his net.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me, a bed partner?&#34; She bolted upright, voice rising,disbelief ringing in every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis studied her startled face, a peculiar satisfaction settling over him. His lips curved, a mischievous smile surfacing, with a rogue&#39;s glint dancing in his eyes. He reached out,long fingers tipping up her chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning close, his breath mingled with hers, warm air pressing into the narrow space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not willing?&#34; Luis asked softly, teasing in tone,echoing her earlier play. &#34;You were more than eager in bed just now; I thought you&#39;d jump at the offer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze held hers captive, missing nothing in her shifting expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda felt her patience flare, heat rising from her ears down her neck. Not shyness, but a storm between reluctance and yearning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inwardly, two tiny voices clashed. One cried it was absurd to accept; the other, bewitched, urged her to surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her lip, caught in the tug-of-war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, she drew a long breath, as though sealing her choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lifted to his. &#34;I can agree, but don&#39;t you dare regret it.&#34;</p>
