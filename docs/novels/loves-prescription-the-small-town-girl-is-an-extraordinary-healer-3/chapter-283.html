                <p>Hanging up,Verena quickened her steps toward the car waiting by the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as her fingers brushed the handle, a bodyguard&#39;s arm shot out like a barrier, halting her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned sharply, brows knitting, eyes flashing with bewilderment.&#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard looked troubled, bowing his head as if carrying a burden. &#34;Ma&#39;am, Mr. Bennett instructed me not to let you go off alone. It&#39;s for your safety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s frown deepened, her tone cutting through the air.,&#34;This is urgent. I&#39;m going to save someone.Don&#39;t stand in the way-I&#39;ll explain to lsaac myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was steady, a command wrapped in steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard pressed his lips together, caught in a tug-of-war within. He knew well how lsaac regarded her-like the rarest treasure locked away from harm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, with her pregnancy, both Verena and the unborn child were the very axis of Isaac&#39;s world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dared not push too far. If she was upset and something happened, Isaac would punish him without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze flickered between Verena&#39;s face and her rounded belly. With a helpless sigh, he yielded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, he lowered his arm, pulled open the door, and bowed slightly. &#34;Please,take care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena offered a soft word of thanks before sliding into the seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard shut the door, eyes tracking the car until it melted into the main road. Only then did he finally look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy sigh, he pulled out his phone and dialed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call connected, Isaac&#39;s deep voice cutting across the line. &#34;Is it settled?&#34; The guard knew Isaac meant Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening,he answered with careful respect. &#34;It&#39;s handled. Mrs. Bennett said she&#39;ll pass the evidence to the Clokron police. For now, Carl is in Luis&#39; custody.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Isaac said curtly, mind drifting to Verena&#39;s pregnancy and how severely morning sickness had been wearing her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did she go home to rest?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard hesitated, and then spoke carefully. &#34;After leaving the restaurant, Mrs. Bennett received a call from someone named Ivan. She&#39;s leaving with him for Crilizult. I tried to stop her, but she insisted. Icouldn&#39;t hold her back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac tightened his grip on his pen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The paper tore under his hand, a jagged gash slicing it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip tightened even more, knuckles whitening. His expression clouded over, dark as a storm brewing on the horizon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How many times had this cycle repeated?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One call-and Verena vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a cruelly simple trick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding his teeth, Isaac forced the words through clenched jaws. &#34;Did she say why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard replied at once, &#34;She said it was to save someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s brow furrowed, a vein throbbing at his temple. He bit the words out, low and harsh. &#34;I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, he ended the call in gloom. Leaning back hard in the leather chair, he tipped his head against it, throat taut as his breath dragged rough and uneven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze locked on the ceiling, eyes dark with frustration, chest heaving with restless weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strangled by it, he clawed at his tie, tugging until the knot gave way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once neat and precise, it now sagged uselessly against his shirt. With a sharp pull, he tore it free and flung it aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the suffocating heaviness only thickened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened further, like thunderclouds about to burst. After a few harsh breaths, he snatched his phone,calling Jacob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Jacob answered, Isaac&#39;s voice cut like a blade. &#34;Cancel the meeting. Book me the next flight to Crilizult.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t wait for acknowledgment, just hung up, spun his wheelchair, and drove it toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Shoildon Airport, Verena met Ivan without trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clutched the tickets tightly, urgency written in every move as he pulled her toward the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they scanned their passes, Verena asked, &#34;Ivan, what&#39;s going on? Why the rush?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan&#39;s face was stricken, eyes rimmed red, voice trembling. &#34;It&#39;s Luciana. She was in a car crash. Head injury. The doctors in Crilizult said they can&#39;t operate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena knew Luciana Murray was the woman Ivan cared for, though they had never crossed paths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Verena&#39;s chest tightened. The head-most delicate, most unforgiving of places.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation was graver than she had imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she steadied herself, voice calm and anchoring. &#34;Don&#39;t panic. The flight to Crilizult is only ninety minutes. We&#39;ll make it in time. Don&#39;t let fear defeat you before we even arrive.&#34; Ivan nodded stifly, though worry clung to him like a shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tickets checked, they boarded swiftly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Less than two hours later, the plane touched down in Crilizult Airport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena and Ivan hurried straight to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nurse rushed forward, guiding them down a long corridor, into an elevator, and finally into an office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, several doctors sat around a table, brows furrowed, the air heavy wit debate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena entered, one older doctor-Huxley Gordon-froze in astonishment. So this was the famed Evelyn?Young, striking, and far from the picture he had painted inhis mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered, edged with awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena extended her hand politely. &#34;Hello, I&#39;m Evelyn. Or you may call me Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huxley quickly rose, grasping her hand with both of his, relief and respect lighting his face. &#34;Evelyn, what an honor. I&#39;ve heard of your brilliance for years. To finally meet you-so young, yet already so accomplished-it inspires nothing but admiration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A &#34;Thank you,&#34; Verena replied with a faint smile, bowing her head modestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her expression sharpened, voice brisk and urgent. &#34;A life is hanging by a thread. Tell me the patient&#39;s exact condition so I can prepare for surgery at once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huxley nodded rapidly.&#34;Yes, of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corridor lights blazed white as Verena strode toward the OR. Calm yet swift, her steps carried the quiet authority of someone who had walked into storms before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time was slipping fast, but her presence radiated strength-steel wrapped in serenity.</p>
