                <p>As soon as Verena reached the police station, she caught sight of Danica and Bobby standing at the front entrance,giving the impression that they had been there for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her presence did not go unnoticed. Bobby spotted her right away and stormed over, his voice thick with frustration. &#34;Verena, can you believe what that mániac Katelyn is saying about you? She&#39;s got people after her,yet she&#39;s pointing the finger at you, acting like you&#39;re behind everything. She&#39;s just making things up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped, glancing at Verena as if afraid she might be upset, and quickly added, &#34;I know you&#39;re not to blame. The police just want to talkto you. There&#39;s no reason to be scared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby looked as though he was about to add more, but Danica stepped in and pulled him behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze lingered on Verena, her expression hard to read. &#34;Officer Waldo Collins is inside waiting for you.You should head in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She feIt a debt of gratitude to Verena for the help she had given Isaac, especially regarding the recovery of his sex function. Yet, the reality that Katelyn had been targeted could not be ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s statements were detailed and sounded genuine, while Verena had never been the kind to fabricate stories. Danica felt caught in the middle, uncertain about who to trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of their last phone conversation weighed on Verena, and she knew that Danica&#39;s faith in Katelyn ran deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet acceptance passed over her face. &#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena then glanced at Bobby, her expression softening as she offered a gentle smile. &#34;It&#39;s okay, Bobby. I&#39;Il be fine,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside the interrogation room, an officer spoke to her in a polite tone. &#34;Please hold on for a bit. Officer Collins will arrive shortly.&#34; Verena answered him with a warm smile and a small nod, &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely two minutes later, the door opened, and two men entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An older man walked in first, followed by a younger officer carrying a pen and notebook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calm, unreadable expression, the older man asked, &#34;Are you Verena Willis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising from her seat, Verena caught sight of the badge on his chest and answered with a pleasant smile,&#34;Yes, Officer Collins, that&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo gave a slight nod and sat down across from Verena, while the note-taker quietly took his place at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fixing his eyes on her, Waldo said, &#34;This meeting concerns the recent attempt on Katelyn Fuller&#39;s life. Based on her statement, you&#39;re currently our main suspect, so we&#39;ll need to ask you a few questions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Attempted murder?&#34; Verena arched a brow, a subtle smile touching her lips. &#34;I don&#39;t believeI understand.Could you explain what you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo replied without hesitation, lacing his fingers together,&#34;Absolutely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes shifted to the notebook before him as he asked, &#34;Can you tell me where you were on the morning of December 1st?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena paused, thinking back. &#34;I was at home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo continued his line of questioning. &#34;Can anyone confirm that for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remaining calmn, Verena said, &#34;The housekeeper was there all day. I never left the house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo observed her closely, noting how she remained steady, uncertain whether her calm meant confidence or simply nerves of steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone turned more serious as he continued, &#34;That morning, Katelyn was nearly killed at a busy intersection on Wood Street by a group of vehicles acting in concert. Every move was meant to end her life.Luckily, our patrol arrived just in time and stopped things from going any further.&#34; He paused, and then continued, &#34;After she was brought to the hospital, someone made another attempt on her life within forty-eight hours. I&#39;ve followed up with the victim, and right now, all signs point to you as the leading suspect. So, I need to ask plainly-have you ever had any disputes with Miss Katelyn Fuller?&#34;</p>
