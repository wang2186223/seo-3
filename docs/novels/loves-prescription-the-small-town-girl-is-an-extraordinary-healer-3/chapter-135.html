                <p>Katelyn stayed silent on the line, her mind turning over carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their last meeting had shown her that Verena was far more complex than she had first assumed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under usual circumstances, Verena would never have let Kaia off so quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From what she sensed, Verena clearly doubted Kaia&#39;s true intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking her silence at last, Katelyn said to Kaia, &#34;I understand you. For now, keep patient. Wait for me to reach out, and don&#39;t try to come see me until then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, she turned her eyes toward the butler. &#34;Have all my instructions been carried out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bowed his head in confirmation. &#34;Yes, Miss Fuller. Everything has been arranged. Yesterday, I sent an invitation to Professor Branson on your behalf, presenting you as the esteemed surgeon from Cloverland Hospital in Clokron. This morning, I received his reply-he will meet you at the Fortune Garden Restaurant at noon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s lips curved with satisfaction. &#34;Excellent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at the clock, she strode toward the walk-in closet. &#34;Get the car ready,&#34; she said. &#34;I&#39;ll change quickly.I intend to be early.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler responded firmly, &#34;Yes.&#34; He then turned to head downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she reached the restaurant, Katelyn was a full thirty minutes ahead of schedule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler had secured a private suite, discreet and soundproof, chosen to ensure no conversation could slip beyond its walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exactly on time, Wendell stepped into the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting her already seated, he offered a polite apology. &#34;Dr. Fuller, forgive me. University matters delayed me until just now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rose to greet him, her smile warm and deferential. &#34;Professor Branson, as a fellow doctor, I consider it a privilege to meet you. Even if I had to wait all day, it would be worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a modest wave of his hand, Wendell replied, &#34;You flatter me, Dr. Fuller. Age alone doesn&#39;t make me greater, and my skills may not outshine yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile lingered as she motioned to the chair across from her. &#34;Sit, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he was seated, she reached for the bottle and filled his glass before serving her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her glass, she remarked, &#34;Professor Branson, your work has always inspired me, yet you&#39;ve graciously agreed to meet someone like me, who has barely scratched the surface of medicine. I&#39;m deeply grateful.Let me drink to you-and to our profession!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Katelyn tipped back her glass and drained it in a single motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing his hands firmly on his knees, Wendell shook his head. &#34;Dr. Fuller, I came here because I know of your accomplishments. We&#39;re both servants of medicine, both willing to give of ourselves for it. Don&#39;t sell yourself short.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the invitation reached him the day before, Wendell noticed it bore Katelyn&#39;s name, a doctor with weighty reputation abroad. Because he treasured connections with colleagues in his field, he had answered without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering this, Wendell smiled warmly and lifted his glass.&#34;It&#39;s rare to find someone who burns with the same devotion. To our calling in medicine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him empty his glass, Katelyn arched her brows ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The impression she gathered was clear-Wendell would not be hard to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the glasses were lowered, the table quickly filled with dish after dish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patience guided her this time; even halfway through the meal she kept her true agenda hidden. Instead,she steered the conversation toward lighter subjects, and their exchange remnained cordial. Only after Wendell placed his knife and fork neatly aside did Katelyn drop her question with practiced ease.She asked, &#34;Professor Branson, I heard from a friend that you&#39;re acquainted with Evelyn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware of her intent, Wendell dabbed his mouth with a napkin. &#34;That&#39;s right. We collaborated some time ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows knitted together for the briefest moment before smoothing again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was enough to confirm Kaia&#39;s words held weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn pretended to be astonished, her eyes widening before she allowed admiration to soften her expression. A faint blush rose to her cheeks. &#34;Truly? Evelyn has been my idol for years. She inspired me to follow this path in medicine. I admire her so much. Professor Branson, could you... perhaps help me get her autograph?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The request seemed simple enough. Wendell gave a nod. &#34;Of course. When I see her again, I&#39;ll bring it back for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face lit up with delight. &#34;That&#39;s amazing. Thank you, Professor Branson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her words were done, she dipped her head, letting a troubled look cross her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her sudden shift, Wendell leaned in. &#34;Dr. Fuller, is something troubling you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her eyes slowly, Katelyn spoke with careful softness. &#34;Professor Branson, may I ask a favor of you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell had carried the same generous spirit from his younger days into his old age, never losing his kindness. &#34;If there&#39;s anything I can do to help, please don&#39;t hesitate to ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching a glimmer of opportunity, Katelyn steadied her expression. &#34;The truth is, I&#39;m facing a case that has left me completely at a loss. I&#39;ve tried everything, yet I can&#39;t find a viable treatment. Because you know Evelyn, I was hoping you could arrange for me to meet her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her request, Wendell exhaled slowly, his face clouded with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled how he had recently reached out to Evelyn himself, inviting her to deliver a lecture at Acorith College of Medicine. Her response had been polite but firm-she was occupied and unable to attend, forcing the event to be delayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking his head, Wendell explained, &#34;Dr. Fuller, I&#39;d gladly help if I could. But Evelyn keeps her life tightly guarded. She avoids attention and rarely reveals her location. I&#39;m afraid arranging a meeting simply isn&#39;t possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the shadow of disappointment on her face, Wendell suggested, &#34;Perhaps this instead-share the patient&#39;s details with me, and I&#39;ll forward them to Evelyn. Once she replies, I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re informed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that reassurance,Katelyn knew with certainty that Wendell truly did have contact with Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a celebrated professor in Shoildon, Wendell had neither motive nor reason to invent such a story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than answering, Katelyn slipped a hand into her purse, drew out a check, and slid it across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perplexed by the gesture, Wendell frowned at the check. &#34;Why are you giving me-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cutting him off, Katelyn said coldly, &#34;I take it that you&#39;ve seen Evelyn in person. Professor Branson,I need something unusual from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smile that didn&#39;t quite reach her eyes, she continued, &#34;There&#39;s a patient I wish to treat, but unless they believe I am Evelyn, I won&#39;t be accepted as their doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words made Wendell narrowthis eyes, suspicion hardening his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speaking as though it were a small matter, Katelyn added, &#34;Since Evelyn avoids the public, I need you to vouch for me, telling the patient&#39;s family that I am Evelyn herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at her in shock, Wendell stammered, &#34;What on earth are you asking of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile never wavered. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. The truth will come out in time. I don&#39;t mean to steal Evelyn&#39;s identity forever-just long enough to win the family&#39;s trust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her words sank in, Wendell&#39;s fist struck the table, sending the dishes rattling across the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you expect me to lie, to help you pose as Evelyn and trick a patient&#39;s family?&#34; His eyes hardened with sudden clarity as he glared at her. &#34;Now i see your reason for this meeting. Hear me, Katelyn Fuller-I&#39;m a man of principle, and I&#39;Il never lower myself to that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right and wrong had always been clear lines for Wendell.Feeling utterly betrayed, he jabbed a finger at her.&#34;I misjudged you completely. What kind of doctor stoops to this? You stain the very name of medicine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through his tirade, Katelyn held her tongue, her calm expression unbroken as she allowed him to rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when his voice broke into a cough did she finally smile and speak. &#34;&#39;Professor Branson, you may say no,but you should think carefully about what follows.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His palm struck the table once more as he shot to his feet. &#34;Shameless woman! I&#39;ll not waste another word on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice cut through his fury. &#34;Professor Branson, you have such a beautiful grandson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single mention made him freeze. Katelyn&#39;s brows lifted as she added smoothly, &#34;He&#39;s a precious boy.But accidents happen, don&#39;t they? A kidnapping... a sudden crash... or even robbers in the wrong place at the wrong time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding his teeth, Wendell spun toward her. &#34;This is a nation of law-how dare you try to intimidate me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>KKatelyn kept her smile, but there was a sharper edge beneath it. &#34;This isn&#39;t meant as a threat, Professor Branson. I only want to help you.df you choose to cooperate, your grandson will remain safe, and your family will thrive, living a life of security and respect.&#34;</p>
