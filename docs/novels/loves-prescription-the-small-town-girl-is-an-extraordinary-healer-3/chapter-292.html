                <p>Verena led Alec and Laura straight to her hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the DNA samples were collected, the hallway turned into a place of restless waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying a word, Verena took a seat on a bench, her eyes never leaving the closed door ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec and Laura lingered nearby, their faces a mix of nerves and mounting confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura lowered her voice, unable to hide her worry. &#34;Alec, do you have any idea what she&#39;s really after?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation flashed in Alec&#39;s eyes as he snapped back, &#34;You think I can read her mind? Your guess is as good as mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nurse eventually returned with an envelope in hand. Verena accepted it with a cool nod, barely glancing at the nurse before unfolding the paper. The words&#34;no biological relationship&#34; stared up at her. Her face showed nothing. She had expected as much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not the first time she had faced the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec reached for the report so quickly it almost tore in his hands. His eyes scanned the page until they landed on the words&#34;no biological relationship&#34;,and in that instant, his entire body locked up.He stood motionless, staring in stunned disbelief, unable to look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t possible...&#34; said Alec, his voice trembling as he shook his head. &#34;There has to be some kind of error!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura stood rooted beside him, her eyes wide, face pinched in shock and confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion carved sharp lines across Laura&#39;s face. Her eyebrows knitted together as she struggled to make sense of what she was seeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning toward Verena, she couldn&#39;t hold back anymore. &#34;Verena, I gave birth to you. For nine months, I felt every heartbeat.How can you not be my daughter?&#34; Verena showed no sign of emotion. She watched the meltdown before her with chilly indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of amusement crossed her lips as she took in the sight of Alec and Laura teetering on the edge,both their worlds crumbling in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold and direct, Verena didn&#39;t botherhiding her contempt. &#34;How long are you planning to keep this charade going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words cut sharper than glass, and her stare left no doubt about how little respect she had left for either of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec&#39;s face flushed crimson, fury overtaking confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s gotten into you, Verena?&#34; His voice thundered down the corridor, drawing stares from people nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassed by the attention, he leaned closer, dropping his voice. &#34;First you drag us to this hospital,now you&#39;re tossing out accusations. What are you after, exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every glance at Verena fueled his anger; he was certain she was stirring up trouble just to spite him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena faced him, the chill in her posture radiating from the quiet tension in her narrow shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disgust twisted in her gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d clung to the hope that Alec and Laura might finally tell the truth themselves. Clearly, that hope had been wasted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Verena unzipped her handbag and pulled out a crisp, folded sheet of paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every movement was deliberate as she walked over and held the document out to Alec.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Read it for yourself. There&#39;s no hiding from the truth now.&#34; Her tone was measured, every syllable steady and clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec&#39;s hands shook as he unfolded the report, his eyes racing across the lines until the answer became painfully obvious. There it was in black and white-Verena and Luis were biologically related. Luis Sampson, whose name alone was enough to send ripples of fear through the city&#39;s elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revrelation was impossible to deny. Verena wasn&#39;t their daughter. She was a Sampson by birth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec&#39;s legs suddenly gave out, and he nearly dropped to the floor as the truth hit him like a physical blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s eyes stayed glued to Alec, picking up on the tremor in his limbs before he even faltered. She lunged forward, wrapping an arm around him to keep him upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity and dread tangled inside her. What could have possibly rattled Alec this much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After making sure he wouldn&#39;t collapse, Laura edged closer, snatching a peek at the report in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her whole body stiffened. Every ounce of color drained from her face as she read the words that shattered everything she thought she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Alec stared at the test results, both so shaken that neither could speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence dragged on until Verena finally broke it, her voice sharp and cutting. &#34;You&#39;ve seen it for yourselves,haven&#39;t you? I belong to the Sampson family. Luis Sampson is my brother. You have never been my family-not by blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look she gave Alec and Laura was nothing short of ice-cold. Any wish for reconciliation had burned away, leaving only years of betrayal and anger in its place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So tell me-how did you pull me away from the Sampson family all those years ago?&#34; Verena&#39;s tone dripped with accusation, her anger barely contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;d be wise to come clean now. Because if you don&#39;t, neither the Bennett family nor the Sampson family will ever let this go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura reeled, her mind spinning with shock and resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never dreamed she could raise a child only to discover she belonged to someone else all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s thoughts spun into chaos. Could it be true that she had spent all these years raising someone else&#39;s child? The longer she dwelled on it, the heavier her chest felt, as though a stone had settled there and refused to move. Bitterness clawed at her, feeding a growing unwillingness to accept the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she looked up and met Verena&#39;s unyielding stare, a chill crept through her. Fear replaced every ounce of defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both the Sampson and Bennett families carried power she dared not provoke. If Verena truly believed she&#39;d been stolen, the fallout would be catastrophic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driven by desperation, Laura rushed forward, words tumbling from her lips. &#34;Verena, I swear I don&#39;t know what this is about. You&#39;re the daughter I gave birth to! If you doubt me, then check the records. It was Plentlight Hospital, the year you were born. I never took anyone else&#39;s child-I swear it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec, meanwhile, was drowning in his own storm of emotions. Frustration pounded in his chest until it hurt to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage burned across his face, his chest tightening with a mix of regret and unwillingness that left him restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought gnawed at him-how could the girl he had raised all these years turn out to belong to someone else?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All those sacrifices, all that time-was it nothing but a wasted effort?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of how cold and dismissive he had been toward Verena struck himn like a blade, a pang of panic carving deep into his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reality of the Sampson family&#39;s power pressed on him next. They weren&#39;t just influential-they were untouchable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had things not fallen apart between them and Verena, there might have been chances to build even stronger ties through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Alec admitted to himself that they had backed themselves into a corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he could turn back time, he would have handled Verena very differently. A heavy sigh escaped him. The test results left no room for denial, yet he clung to the stubborn thought that she was still his daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, Verena was remarkable. Her beauty, her talent, her strength, all of it set her apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether he said it aloud or not, Alec had always counted on her to be the pillar that carried the Willis family into the future.</p>
