                <p>The detective didn&#39;t disappoint-three days later,Verena found a new email in her inbox.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She settled at her desk and clicked open the file. A spreadsheet sprang to life on her screen, brimming with names and numbers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a complete rundown of every individual who&#39;d snapped up Sampson Group shares in recent months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes scanned each entry, her pen darting across a legal pad as she mapped out connections,drawing circles and arrows with practiced care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena sifted through the data, she watched a maze of hidden relationships start to take shape on her screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It became clear that the people buying up shares weren&#39;t acting alone-each was part of a web, bound by family, old alliances, or business dealings that stretched back for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What once looked like random names scattered across a spreadsheet slowly revealed a tight network,threads overlapping in every direction. This roster of shareholders was more than a list-it was a trapdoor map, giving the illusion of chaos while masking intricate connections beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena clicked from profile to profile, tracing every link and cross-referencing every name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, all the scattered pieces began to draw together. Despite the illusion of randomness, every path, no matter how convoluted, circled back to a single figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That person was-Howe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how tangled or circuitous the trail,every connection circled back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was close family, distant acquaintances,or business partners from the past, all roads inevitably pointed straight to Howe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt as though Howe was the mastermind, pulling every string in this elaborate game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena leaned back in her chair, brow creased as she replayed the memory of spotting Howe near the intersection by Sherwood&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood wasn&#39;t just any bystander-he was a  seasoned player in the business world, his influence within Sampson Group still lingering thanks to favors and deals from years past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe,with his szable stake and sway in the company,had no good reason to be anywhere near Sherwood&#39;s home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given Sherwood&#39;s long-standing ties to the Sampson family, any meeting between the two should have been strictly off-limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way this was just a coincidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lowered her gaze, and then looked up again,eyes flashing with a razor-sharp gleam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every instinct screamed at her-Howe was hiding something bigger, someone even more cunning operating from the shadowNS.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And whatever that secret was, Sherwood was in the thick of it too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena folded her arms and sank back in her chair,thoughts churning beneath a mask of composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence in her study was broken only by the slow,steady tick of the wall clock, each sound amplifying the tension building inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes grew somber as one clue after another  tangled together in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she considered the hidden connection between Howe and Sherwood-and the web of investors wrapped around Sampson Group-the more a prickling sense of unease swept over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, she let out a weary breath and reached for her phone, scrolling until Luis&#39; name appeared on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Verena hovered over Luis&#39; number, and then set her phone aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not the sort of puzzle to untangle through a phone call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some conversations demanded eye contact and privacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her fingers to her temples, trying to soothe the headache that came with all these new questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, she would have to carve out time for a proper discussion with Luis, face-to-face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few days later, Verena left the hospital early in the morning and slid into the back seat of her car, giving the driver a single, clear order. &#34;Take me to the  airport. I need to catch a flight to Ochrerayd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver gave a nod and pulled away from the curb,weaving through city traffic until the airport came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, they eased to a stop at the bustling terminal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few hours and a smooth flight later, Verena found herself greeted by a Sampson family chauffeur,ready and waiting to drive her to the Sampson Group building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the car rolled to a halt at the foot of Sampson Group&#39;s skyscraper, Verena stepped out and tilted her head back, taking in the sheer scale of the building.Sunlight bounced off the glass exterior, each ray a silent testament to decades of ambition and achievement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flush of pride warmed her chest, quickly shadowed by a whisper of unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brushed away the worry, squared her shoulders,and strode toward the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the marble floors shone so brightly they caught her reflection at every step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lobby stretched wide and bright, sunlight pouring in through tall windows as employees hurried across  polished floors, the space alive with the energy of a thriving business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena strode straight to the reception counter and offered a polite greeting. &#34;Good morning. I&#39;m here to see Luis Sampson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as her voice echoed through the lobby, two young women at the front desk glanced up without thinking. Their gazes collided with Verena&#39;s, and for a heartbeat,the world seemed to stand still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing before them, Verena wore a sleek silk dress that effortlessly complemented her pregnant form,highlighting a figure that spoke of self-care and discipline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gentle features and luminous complexion showed no sign of tiredness. Pregnancy had not left its mark on her face, and it was obvious she&#39;d taken meticulous care of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Admiration flickered in the eyes of the receptionists.It was rare to witness someone who could radiate such elegance and poise while expecting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They shared a silent look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s identity had been made public by Luis, and her impressive reputation in the medical world made it easy for them to put a name to the face. After a moment, their professionalism kicked in.Warm smiles bloomed, and one of them said, &#34;You must be Mr. Sampson&#39;s sister. He&#39;s working upstairs right now Let me show you the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, she hurried around the desk and led Verena to the elevators, casting respectful and curious glances over her shoulder to make sure Verena stayed close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the elevator finally arrived with a soft chime,they rode to the top floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the doors slid open, the receptionist prepared to step out first, ready to guide Verena further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Verena smiled kindly and spoke in a gentle tone.&#34;Thank you, but I can find my way from here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist paused for a moment, and then nodded, still smiling as she gestured to the left. &#34;Of course. Mr. Sampson&#39;s office is the first door down that hall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena offered a quiet nod of appreciation and moved down the left corridor without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With each step, anticipation built until she reached a closed office door. Lifting her hand, she rapped her knuckles gently against the wood, waiting. When no answer came, curiosity urged her to try the handle. As she pushed the door open, Verena found herself rooted to the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise swept across her face, her calm composure giving way to disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Miranda lounged sideways in Luis&#39; lap, the two pressed together so closely that the air in the room seemed to crackle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s head lowered, her teeth playfully tugging at the crisp fabric of Luis&#39; shirt. The collar was askew,and a few buttons had been undone, exposing the defined lines of his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis wore his suit jacket open, his tie loose and forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed by Miranda&#39;s playful taunting,he tilted his head away. His neck strained, Adam&#39;s apple moving as he swallowed, and a flash of embarrassment replaced his usual confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pair looked like models caught in a magazine shoot-so much so that Verena felt heat creeping up her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Struggling to hide her amusement, she cleared her throat and grinned. &#34;Well, don&#39;t let me stop you. Go right ahead.&#34;Without lingering, she spun on her heel and quietly pulled the door shut.</p>
