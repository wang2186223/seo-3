                <p>From a distance, Verena silently observed the commotion, taking in every detail as the scene unfolded. Apparently, the woman who had spent years chasing after lsaac was the arrogant type.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shrugging off her thought, Verena strode over to the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn was still dabbing juice from her fingers when a soft shadow approached her. Looking up, she found herself face-to-face with a woman whose features were refined and whose presence was effortlessly graceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight arch of her brow, and Katelyn paused. &#34;So you must be Verena Willis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile appeared as Verena gave a nod.&#34;That&#39;s right, I&#39;m Verena.&#34; An unexpected wave of discomfort washed over Katelyn at Verena&#39;s easy acknowledgment. She&#39;d gone to great lengths to look her best, thinking she might unsettle Verena with her own confidence.Knowing Kaia since childhood, Katelyn had assumed Verena would possess the same simple, understated grace as Kaia. She had never anticipated how strikingly beautiful Verena actually was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, Katelyn tossed her used napkin into the trash, her lips curving into a calculated smile. &#34;If memory serves, we agreed on two o&#39;clock for this meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena pulled out a chair and sat down, her eyes flicking to her phone before she spoke. &#34;Is that so?I&#39;m sorry about that. Looks like I&#39;m running an hour behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the apology, Verena&#39;s tone was airy and nonchalant, betraying no real regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour of waiting had frayed Katelyn&#39;s patience, and Verena&#39;s relaxed attitude only made things worse. It stung to think lsaac had chosen someone like Verena  over her. Besides her beauty, what did this woman possibly have to offer?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There wasn&#39;t any point in starting a fight right away,so Katelyn forced her irritation down and kept her smile intact. Still, her words carried unmistakable sarcasm. &#34;I heard you grew up somewhere pretty remote and only came to Shoildon this year. I suppose punctuality isn&#39;t something you&#39;re used to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath Katelyn&#39;s soft tone, her words carried a subtle bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than rising to the challenge, Verena turned to a waiter and quietly asked for a glass of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t long before the waiter returned,setting the glass in front of her. Verena offered a quiet thank you, took a small sip, and then looked across the table at Katelyn with a calm smile. &#34;Apologies, I&#39;ve had my hands full lately, so anything not urgent tends to get pushed aside. As for my sense of time...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused for a moment, mneeting Katelyn&#39;s gaze with a mild, almost teasing comment. &#34;I&#39;m actually  the type who&#39;s never late. Today&#39;s meeting with you just slipped my mind, that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s lips curled in a private smirk. What kind of person claimed to be punctual, only to forget a meeting? It was obvious to her that Verena&#39;s lack of polish showed, even now that she was living in comfort. No matter how fancy Verena&#39;s new life,she&#39;d always be out of place among the elite with Isaac.People in their social circle would surely gossip about the two of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Katelyn dwelled on it, the more convinced she became that lsaac couldn&#39;t really be in love with Verena. He was just being dutiful, keeping up appearances for the sake of family expectations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surely, Katelyn believed only someone like her, a childhood friend with history and a connection to Isaac&#39;s world, could truly stand beside him,through whatever came their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking off these thoughts, KKatelyn kept her expression perfectly composed. &#34;You must be incredibly busy. I appreciate you squeezing me in,&#34; she said. Then she added with a hint of emphasis,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Katelyn Fuller, Isaac&#39;s friend since we were children, and, as you may have heard, we are childhood sweethearts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn lingered on the phrase &#34;childhood sweethearts,&#34; making it clear she wanted Verena to notice just how special her.connection with lsaac was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena remained composed, her face relaxed and friendly as she patiently waited for Katelyn to say more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Verena&#39;s expression remained unfazed,Katelyn assumed she must be holding back a pang of jealousy. After all, what woman wouldn&#39;t feel uneasy facing her husband&#39;s childhood sweetheart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening in her seat, Katelyn&#39;s lips curved into a confident smile. &#34;To tell you the truth, I came today because I&#39;m concerned about lsaac&#39;s health. As his wife, I&#39;m sure you want the best for his recovery, just as l do.&#34;  Verena took a moment to study Katelyn, searching her memory for the connection, and then it clicked.Katelyn&#39;s name had come up in those tabloid articles linked to Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the pieces falling into place, Verena quickly saw through Katelyn&#39;s intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One eyebrow lifted, she responded, &#34;Of course I want Isaac to get better. But what exactly are you suggesting, Miss Fuller? Are you hoping to oversee Isaac&#39;s treatment yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With unwavering confidence, Katelyn met Verena&#39;s direct gaze. &#34;That&#39;s right, I plan to take on lsaac&#39;s treatment myself.I know you&#39;re a doctor as well, but his situation isn&#39;t something just anyone can manage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;ls that so?&#34; Verena leaned back and crossed her arms, her voice cool.&#34;SOo you believe you can succeed where I would fail, is that right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Katelyn was convinced of her own abilities,she made sure her words and posture radiated poise and sophistication in Verena&#39;s presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear,offering a warm smile. &#34;Please don&#39;t misunderstand me. I&#39;m not doubting your abilities. The truth is,Isaac&#39;s mother has already sought out numerous renowned doctors, and none have succeeded. Your credentials are impressive, but so many have tried and failed with Isaac. Every unsuccessful attempt only makes things harder for him. We simply can&#39;t take unnecessary risks with his health.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft chuckle escaped Verena. She recognized how cleverly Katelyn tried to elevate herself while subtly undermining her at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, no one should be reckless with lsaac&#39;s well-being.But what makes you so sure that I&#39;m the risk, and you&#39;re the solution?&#34; Verena crossed one leg over the other, a spark of amusement in her gaze.&#34;Miss Fuller, you and I both know medicine doesn&#39;t offer guarantees. No real doctor would promise a perfect outcome, isn&#39;t that right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can make that claim because I&#39;ve achieved results before,&#34; Katelyn replied, her smile taking on a hint of superiority. &#34;Could it be that you&#39;re doubting me because lsaac&#39;s shown some improvement while you&#39;re caring for him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her glass, Verena took a calm sip, unfazed.&#34;Whether he&#39;s getting better or not, why does that matter to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The evasive response only seemed to confirm Katelyn&#39;s suspicions. She felt even more certain that Verena wasn&#39;t capable of curing Isaac; if shewere,she wouldn&#39;t be so indirect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her assessment now complete, Katelyn dismissed Verena as all ego and little substance-not worth her energy or competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in,Katelyn lowered her voice and spoke with deliberate clarity. &#34;Let me reassure you, I&#39;m not here to stir up any drama. My only goal is to see lsaac recover, which benefits you too, doesn&#39;t it? I&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d support me in convincing lsaac to accept my treatment.&#34; Verena saw right through Katelyn&#39;s indirect tactics now. Katelyn wasn&#39;t just eager to showcase her long-standing bond with lsaac; she also wanted her to persuade Isaac to accept her treatment plan.</p>
