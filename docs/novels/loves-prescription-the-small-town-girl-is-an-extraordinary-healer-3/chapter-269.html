                <p>Once the call went through, Luis spoke, his voice trembling ever so slightly. &#34;Dad, I&#39;ve found my sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, his father, Joseph Sampson,staggered, almost swept off his feet by a wave of joy too heavy to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s face, lined with years of sorrow, suddenly brimmed with tears of joy. His voice cracked under the weight of emotion as he pressed, &#34;Luis, what did you just say? My daughter-has she truly been found? Is this real?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing his father&#39;s trembling excitement, Luis was torn by conflicting feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew well the years of torment his parents had endured since his sister vanished-most of all his mother, whose grief had carved deep scars into her mind. Taking a breath, he steadied himself and answered with earnest conviction. &#34;Dad, there&#39;s no mistake.I&#39;ve just done the DNA test. The doctor confirmed it -there is clear blood relation. She is my sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment those words reached him, Joseph let out a cry he could not suppress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes turned to the living room, where a woman sat softly singing to a pillow. Shaken and unsteady,he stumbled toward her, carried along by overwhelming excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crouched before his wife, Marisa Sampson,carefully brushing a few stray strands of hair from her face, and with a hoarse, trembling voice whispered, &#34;Stop singing, Marisa. Our daughter has been found.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman-her hair now streaked with gray, her expression weary and vacant-bore the unmistakable mark of illness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since their daughter&#39;s disappearance, her mind had unraveled. She clutched the pillow as though it were her lost child, insisting she was only singing her to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Luis came of age, Joseph had stepped away from managing the family&#39;s affairs, entrusting everything to his son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He himself remained at home, caring with his own hands for his broken-hearted wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, seeing no flicker of response in her eyes,only the same gentle humming as if nothing had been said, Joseph reached out slowly, attempting to take the pillow from her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his hand neared it, Marisa&#39;s nerves seemed to snap like a bowstring pulled too tight. She erupted with sudden fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her once vacant gaze sharpened into cold fire,locking fiercely onto him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face twisted in agitation, her forehead tightening into deep lines, her lips quivering as she screamed in a voice torn by hysteria, &#34;Don&#39;t take my daughter way! Don&#39;t hurt my daughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her shrill cry shook the room to its very rafters,ringing painfully in Joseph&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grip tightened on the pillow, veins rising on her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph froze, startled by the sudden storm. His hand fell back, and sorrow washed over his features,leaving him helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at the woman before him-her gray hair,her worn face-his voice caught in his throat. &#34;Marisa,our daughter has truly returned. Luis has confirmed it with the doctor. She&#39;s come back to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, as quickly as the tempest rose, it fell away.After her outburst, Marisa sank again into her fragile calm, as though the fury had been nothing more than smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She resumed her gentle humming, cradling the pillow with tender devotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her, Joseph said nothing more. Silent tears traced the furrows of his aged face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening through the phone, Luis felt his chest tighten with sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallowed hard, forcing his voice into steadiness.&#34;Dad, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll see to it that my sister meets you both very soon.&#34;</p>
