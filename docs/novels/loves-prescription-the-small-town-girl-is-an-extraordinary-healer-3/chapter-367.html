                <p>After their last strategy meeting, Verena wasted no time pushing forward with her plan to eliminate every Kirk family supporter in the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the CEO&#39;s office at Benedict Pharmaceuticals,a small group had gathered, including Molly, who stood tense among them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the flawless makeup, the fear in Molly&#39;s eyes was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only last night had Sherwood revealed those old secrets, so now she found herself unsettled in Verena&#39;s presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory weighed on her, and Molly sneaked a nervous glance at Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, arms folded andleaning against the desk,regarded everyone with an unyielding stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing Molly&#39;s attention, Verena looked up, and their eyes briefly locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Molly quickly looked away, avoiding Verena&#39;s gaze as her nerves spiked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, mocking smirk played at the corners of Verena&#39;s mouth. She clearly noticed Molly&#39;s discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her attention back to the rest, Verena&#39;s eyes swept the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice cut through the tension, cool and decisive.&#34;I called you all here today because there are problems within the company that need addressing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Verenafixed her gaze on a man in glasses. &#34;Your project from last month is way behind schedule, and your report is full of errors. Is this what you call professional?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man fidgeted and couldn&#39;t manage a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her focus shifted to someone else. &#34;As for you, you used company resources for your own benefit. Did you think the rules in this company don&#39;t apply to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That employee kept his eyes glued to the floor, too intimidated to answer Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena didn&#39;t hold back. She laid into each person with harsh, unfiltered criticism, making sure everyone in the room felt the pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a casual glance, Verena eyed the three employees who hadn&#39;t dared to speak up. She lifted her chin and announced, &#34;The rest of you aren&#39;t off the hook. You know exactly what you&#39;ve done.&#34; Her tone left no room for argument. &#34;There are clear rules in this company, and you&#39;re not immune to the consequences. Starting now, you&#39;re all suspended for a month. Try to push back and you&#39;ll be out of a job entirely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of anxiety passed through the group as they exchanged uneasy glances. Their hands clenched tighter, and their heads hung even lower than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she&#39;d finished addressing the group,Verena set her sights on Molly, her stare unwavering. &#34;Molly,these people report to you. Their mistakes reflect directly on your leadership,which means you&#39;ve failed in your role.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s whole body went rigid. Color drained from her cheeks, and though she tried to defend herself,Verena&#39;s icy glare shut her down before she could speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena added, &#34;You&#39;re suspended as well, effective immediately. While you&#39;re out, I expect a detailed report on your shortcomings and your plans for improvement. When you have an answer for me, I&#39;ll decide if you&#39;re fit to come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious to everyone in the room that this supposed suspension was just Verena&#39;s first step in seizing control. To Molly and the others, this so-called &#34;suspension&#34;was nothing more than a cover for Verena to bring in her own loyal supporters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never in her life had Molly felt so humiliated. Rage and pain churned inside her as she dug her nails into her palms,trying desperately not to break down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But finally, she couldn&#39;t hold back anymore. Her voice trembled as she shouted, &#34;Verena, this is too much!These people have given years to this company. How can you just cast them aside? Who gave you the authority to treat us this way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena didn&#39;t bother to respond. She simply nodded toward the door and told the other employees, &#34;You may go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, the suspended employees slipped out, frustration and defeat written all over their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the office door clicked shut, Verena turned her attention back to Molly. &#34;You want to know what gives me authority?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold, dismissive laugh slipped from Verena&#39;s lips before she replied, &#34;The answer is simple, I&#39;m the CEO of this company. My title alone is enough. Your failure to lead has put everything at risk. Molly, if you want to keep your job, I suggest you follow my orders Otherwise, you&#39;ll have to face the consequences yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s warning made Molly&#39;s eyes flash wide with outrage, her breaths coming quicker as anger bubbled up inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snapped back, her voice ringing with accusation,&#34;Who are you kidding with this so-called suspension?I&#39;m not blind, Verena. Don&#39;t try to fool me with these fake reasons. I know exactly what you&#39;re up to. First,uprooting my entire team, and now you&#39;re coming after me. It&#39;s obvious you&#39;re pushing me out so you can claim the company for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her frustration boiled over, and she marched toward Verena, her heels striking the floor with unmistakable force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fists clenched tight, Molly stood her ground, as though she was bracing for a confrontation with Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena didn&#39;t flinch. Her gaze remained steady, eyes glacial and unyielding, with a mocking smirk spreading across her face. &#34;And if I am?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She narrowed her eyes, her tone colder than ever.&#34;Have you ever stopped to think about what your father had really done, Molly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The directness of Verena&#39;s question left Molly  momentarily stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She faltered for a short moment, instinctively breaking eye contact and knotting her hands together in front of her, the pain grounding her as she tried to regain her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to give in, shaking her head defiantly.&#34;That&#39;s a lie! My father never did anything to you. Stop spreading these ridiculous accusations!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though her words sounded resolute, Molly&#39;s unsteady voice made her anxiety impossible to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had no patience for Molly&#39;s act. She spoke with deliberate clarity. &#34;Drop the charade, Molly. Let&#39;s get one thing straight. I&#39;m here to bring down the Kirk family for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, eyes burning with conviction. &#34;Not long after I was born, your father had me taken away. That decision changed my entire life, turning my family&#39;s world upside down. All the pain we endured traces back to your family, and now it&#39;s time you faced the consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting her chin, Verena cast a frosty, almost superior look at Molly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone sharpened as she spoke. &#34;You weren&#39;t even born yet when all this happened, so for now, you&#39;re not my target. But I expect you to resign from this company. Remember, Benedict Pharmaceuticals has always belonged to the Sampson family. I&#39;m not stealing it, I&#39;m just taking back what&#39;s ours. Just because you&#39;ve been here for years doesn&#39;t make it yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The calm finality in her voice struck Molly like a physical blow, each sentence cutting deeper than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All strength drained from Molly&#39;s legs, leaving her unsteady. Panic flashed across her face as she struggled to keep standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to respond, but her lips quivered and no sound came out, her voice caught by the weight of shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s icy stare didn&#39;t waver, unmoved by Molly&#39;s obvious distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Molly trembled with outrage, overwhelmed by the loss of everything she&#39;d worked for, Verena seemed to remember something else. With a slight arch of her brow, she added coolly, &#34;One more thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wary glance passed from Molly as she met Verena&#39;s gaze, uncertain of what might come next.</p>
