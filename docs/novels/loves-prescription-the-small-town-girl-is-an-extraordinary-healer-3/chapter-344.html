                <p>Upon hearing Miranda&#39;s words, a flicker of complexity swept through Luis&#39; eyes-astonishment at her agreement, yet overshadowed by an excitement he could scarcely name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile deepened, drawing him closer to her until their noses nearly touched, their breaths interweaving like threads of the same fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, it&#39;s settled then,&#34; he murmured, each syllable tinged with a warm breath that skimmed against her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s gaze narrowed ever so slightly, a playful spark glinting like starlight in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her arms with unhurried grace,looping them around Luis&#39; neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting her head upward, she closed the distance, their lips meeting softly, intimacy flowing between them like a quiet undercurrent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet in that fleeting closeness, Luis&#39; eyes betrayedhim,drifting downward-catching sight of the faint marks scattered across her collarbone, vivid and enticing,bearing a temptation too dangerous to ignore.His eyes sharpened, a wave of heat surging through his chest as instinct urged him to deepen the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could surrender, Miranda, catching his intent, curved her lips into a teasing smile and pulled away with sudden swiftness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m hungry. Let&#39;s go out for dinner.&#34; Her voice, laced with sweetness and playful mischief, chimed as her lashes fluttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis froze, desire still lingering in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his mouth, but no words came-struck helpless beneath her mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty minutes later, Miranda emerged from the dressing room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had chosen a dress that hugged her figure, pairing it with silver heels that echoed softly against the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her makeup was simple, yet touched with an elegance that needed no excess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis, meanwhile, had changed into a suit delivered by the staff. The black tailoring framed his striking form,sharpening his already handsome presence into something commanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat at ease upon the sofa, long legs crossed,his posture relaxed yet refined. In his hand rested his phone, his slender fingers gliding lightly over the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reason for his change of attire was simple: the sportswear he had worn earlier had met its untimely end at the hands of Miranda, who, in a hurried moment,had broken the zipper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,she leaned casually against the doorframe, her eyes quietly measuring Luis. She had to admit-he was dangerously magnetic. His sculpted features and balanced physique were a banquet for the eyes, even when he was seated in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staccato click of heels ceased nearby, drawing Luis&#39; puzzled gaze upward as he slid the phone aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether the re-ignition of passion or something deeper, the moment their gazes intertwined, the air thickened, as if charged with invisible sparks-an unspoken tension that clung between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m ready, let&#39;s go,&#34; Miranda said, breaking the silence with lightness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis gave a slight nod, rose from the sofa, and together they stepped beyond the hotel&#39;s walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the curtains had remained drawn, the lights  aglow. Outside, dusk had descended, and a cool evening breeze swept across Miranda&#39;s face. She shivered,suddenly reminded of the hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Streetlamps flickered on one after another, sketching golden halos along the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her shiver, Luis shrugged off his coat and gently draped it across her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The wind cuts sharp tonight-best not to catch a chill,&#34; he said calmly, his eyes still fixed forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda drew the coat closer, warmed by the lingering trace of his body heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head, her voice playful. &#34;Mr. Sampson,still the gentleman. No wonder so many women hold you in their hearts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Luis faltered at her words. Then,with a faint upward curve of his lips, he answered only with a quiet smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Side by side, they walked into the deepening night, a pair so striking that passersby turned their heads,unable to resist a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that same moment, Molly, weary from a long day,sat in her car at a traffic light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She idled by the roadside, waiting for the green signal to appear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the half-open window, the chatter of high school students drifted in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at that couple ahead-they&#39;re dazzling!&#34; one girl exclaimed, her tone tinged with envy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The man&#39;s got legs so long, and the woman&#39;s figure is stunning!&#34; another chimed in,admiration clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s gaze, almost idle, followed theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment her eyes fell upon the scene ahead,her indifference cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There-walking together-were Luis and Miranda.Their closeness spoke volumes, and the hotel behind them betrayed the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda wore Luis&#39; coat, and the harmony between them was undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bitterness surged in Molly&#39;s chest, sharp and sour as unripe fruit, catching in her throat and pricking at her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Miranda. Rivals in love were faces she never forgot. Verena&#39;s words echoed in her memory-the hints of something between Luis and Miranda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy, disbelief, and unwillingness crashed over her like a risingtide. Her fingers clenched the steering wheel until her knuckles whitened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be true? Did Luis truly feel something for Miranda?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts tangled in a storm of resentment toward Miranda and fear of Luis&#39; uncertain feelings. What unsettled her most wasn&#39;t his uncertainty toward herself, but what he truly felt for Miranda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly narrowed her gaze on him, desperate to read his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet from afar, all she caught was the subtle lift of a smile at his lips-a sight that tightened her chest as though bound by iron bands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The traffic light turned green, cars surged forward, and the air filled with the hum of engines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Molly&#39;s eyes clung to the side mirror, reluctant to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp honk broke her trance, jolting her back. She tore her gaze away, started the engine, and slipped into a side street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the mirror, the figures of Luis and Miranda shrank and blurred, until at last they vanished into the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hollow helplessness pressed upon her chest. Frustration and disappointment burned within her as she reached home. Storming into the living room,she tossed her bag onto the sofa with a heavy thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the dining table sat Sherwood,glasses perched low on his nose, the picture of quiet wisdom as he studied his newspaper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the commotion, he lifted his head, adjusted his spectacles, and spoke with gentle patience. &#34;Molly,come have dinner.&#34;</p>
