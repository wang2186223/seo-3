                <p>A playful note still hung in Verena&#39;s voice, her teasing unrestrained. It took Isaac a moment to catch on, and he cleared his throat, hoping to mask his embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color rushed to his ears, but a small, involuntary smile gave him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his shyness, Verena decided to ease up and let the moment go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, I&#39;ll stop teasing you, for now. But brace yourself, Katelyn&#39;s going to show up tomorrow. Be ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, Isaac&#39;s demeanor shifted. He replied, all trace of playfulness gone, &#34;I&#39;ll have security on standby. Promise me you&#39;ll be carefual.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When noon arrived, Isaac exited the elevator and immediately spotted Katelyn waiting in the lobby. His gaze swept over her, impassive and quick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without acknowledging her, he allowed Jacob to push his wheelchair right toward the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn, unwilling to be ignored, called out, &#34;Isaac, I need to talk to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single lift of Isaac&#39;s hand stopped his assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Katelyn, his stare as cold as his tone.&#34;Katelyn. There&#39;s nothing left between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stung by his words, Katelyn clenched her jaw. Years of friendship meant nothing to him now; he was casting her aside as if she were nobody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt as if Verena stood at the root of it all. Would things have ended like this if she hadn&#39;t come along?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not that it mattered anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena wasn&#39;t going to end up with lsaac, not if she had no chance of having him herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let them believe in their happy ending. Katelyn was eager to watch it unravel. Her fists tightened, knuckles pale, as she struggled to steady her trembling hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing an expression full of remorse, she lowered her voice. &#34;Isaac, I get it-you despise me for all the lies. I&#39;m not here to hold on to you anymore.I understand you never loved me, and I&#39;ve truly moved on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold glint flickered in lsaac&#39;s eyes, a silent smirk forming beneath his calm exterior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she ever wanted a career, acting would have suited her well; such a shame she poured her talent into deception instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,she was stalling for time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could play her game a little longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relaxing in his chair, Isaac&#39;s words cut through the act. &#34;Do you even buy your own story?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>White-knuckled, Katelyn dug her nails into her bag&#39;s strap, fighting to keep her anger in check. Forcing a shaky breath, she let her eyes glisten. &#34;You can believe whatever you want. I have my ticket; I&#39;ll be gone tomorrow afternoon. Isaac, after everything we&#39;ve been through, can&#39;t you have one last meal with me? Just a meal, nothing more. Think of it as saying goodbye. Once I leave, you won&#39;t ever have to see me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Katelyn nearly burst into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their paths would never cross again, she&#39;d see to that herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she boarded her flight, Isaac and Verena would be nothing more than a memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for her, a new Chapter was waiting, untouched by any of them. The rush of anticipation almost made her break character, a smile threatening to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a light rap of his knuckle on the armrest, Isaac angled his jaw slightly upward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, he replied, voice devoid of warmth, &#34;Out of respect for your parents, I&#39;ll give you this one meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the restaurant, from her purse, Katelyn drew out a black card and pushed it across the table in Isaac&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac arched an eyebrow at the card. &#34;And what exactly is this meant to imply?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft, practiced smile played on Katelyn&#39;s lips.&#34;Think of it as compensation. It&#39;s meant for Verena,actually. I can&#39;t bring myself to face her directly, so l hope you&#39;ll give her this card. It&#39;s an apology for everything I&#39;ve put her through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a steady hand, Isaac slid the card right back across the table. &#34;I&#39;ll make sure my wife hears your apology. But there&#39;s no need for the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>·.·</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Verena set out to meet Kaia as they&#39;d agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flagging down a cab, she soon arrived at a derelict  factory far from the city center. Wild vines crawled over broken concrete, and shards of glass cracked beneath every step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place was silent, deserted-nobody in their right mind would come here by choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the show must go on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick scan of her surroundings confirmed Verena was alone with Kaia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning sharply to Kaia, she spoke with urgency in her voice. &#34;You told me Isaac was forced into a car.Where is he? Show me where he is!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nervous flickers ran through Kaia&#39;s eyes before Verena seized her arm. &#34;Where&#39;s Isaac? Say it! Say...&#34;Suddenly,a loud crack rang out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man dressed in black stepped out from the shadows and struck Verena from behind, knocking her unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within seconds, more men emerged, moving in to tie her up tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader reached for his phone and sent a message. &#34;Miss Fuller, we have her.&#34;</p>
