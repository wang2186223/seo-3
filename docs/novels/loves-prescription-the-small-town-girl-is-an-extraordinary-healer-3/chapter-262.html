                <p>Isaac was afraid Verena and Ivan might mend the broken bridge between them, and even more afraid that in the end, he would lose her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two fears tugged at him from opposite ends, and with each heartbeat, the noose of panic drew tighter around his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone trembled in his grip, Verena&#39;s number glowing like a lighthouse in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time and again, his thumb hovered over the call button, yet every time it froze in midair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, he chose to believe in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena would not deceive him. If she said it was something urgent, then surely it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that remained for him was to wait-and wait patiently. But patience wore thin when the night grew long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the clock tolled two in the morning, Verena still had not returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac rubbed his brow, resolve crumbling,and finally pressed call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Verena was curled on the couch, lost in slumber, when her phone shrilled through the silence, sharp and sudden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stirred, frowning, half-dreaming, and reached out blindly. Without glancing at the screen, she answered and said groggily, &#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice-soft, husky with sleep-slid down the line and stopped Isaac cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice came low, searching. &#34;Were you sleeping?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Verena realized it was lsaac, her lips curved into a drowsy smile. &#34;Yeah, dozed off by accident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was still, and Ivan had caught Isaac&#39;s voice through the receiver. His brow arched, and he turned toward Verena, muttering, &#34;Maybe you should head back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena brushed it aside and asked instead, &#34;Did you get it done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan shook his head. He knew the urgency well, but some locks couldn&#39;t be broken in a short timne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had overestimated his own hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was never going to be that simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Isaac&#39;s breath faltered. A man&#39;s voice lingered near Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were together, in the same room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too close-close enough for lsaac to picture the narrow distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip on the phone tightened, knuckles bleaching white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The calm mask he wore cracked, and beneath it bled panic, darkness, and jealousy. He swallowed hard, forcing his tone steady, though a tremor slipped through. &#34;Verena, where are you? I&#39;ll come get you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to see her-only then could the gnawing unease find rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena glanced at the glowing clock on her phone-two a.m.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she really slept that long?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder people said pregnant women were forever drowsy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want Isaac coming out at such an hour.&#34;No need, go to bed. I&#39;ll come back on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena,&#34; Isaac cut her off, voice lower, firmer,carrying weight. &#34;I want to pick you up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She caught it-the strain beneath his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she knew him too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she yielded. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll send you the address.&#34; She hung up, typed the address, and then rose from the couch. &#34;Ivan, it&#39;s late. Get some rest. I&#39;ll head back too. Thanks for tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried a thread of guilt-she had kept him up until the small hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan stood, pretending offense. &#34;Say that again, and I&#39;ll be angry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He treated Verena like kin, and nothing irked him more than her distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mock protest drew a laugh from her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan rubbed at his weary eyes. &#34;Go on. I&#39;ll call the second I crack it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded and made her way to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan moved as though to walk her out, but she waved him off. &#34;No need. Rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, she opened the door and slipped into the night.</p>
