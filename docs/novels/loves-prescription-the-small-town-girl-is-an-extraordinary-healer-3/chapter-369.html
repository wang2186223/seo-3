                <p>Isaac sat a little straighter and spoke into his phone.&#34;Luis, I&#39;m in talks with the project leaders about teaming up, but it seems they&#39;ve already spoken to Sherwood. Now everyone&#39;s getting nervous. Can you step in and talk to them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone carried an easy authority, deep and steady, as if he had everything under control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, Luis&#39; voice cut through, cold and unwavering. &#34;Understood. Here&#39;s the bottom line.Sampson Group and Kirk Group don&#39;t mix. If they go with Kirk, they&#39;re cutting us off for good. And I&#39;ll make sure Kirk Group doesn&#39;t get anywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let his words hang for a second before adding,&#34;But if you choose Bennett Group, you&#39;ll have the Sampson family&#39;s support in ways you wouldn&#39;t expect. You know exactly how much pull Sampson Group has in this business. You should think about this before you make any moves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; voice carried through the speaker, chilling the room and sending a real warning to everyone listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The project leaders looked uneasy, each one quietly  wiping at their foreheads as if they were breaking out in a cold sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They might have had influence in Ochrerayd, but everyone knew Sampson Group&#39;s reach went way past the city and stretched across the entire southern region.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room became so quiet that it felt like all the air had been sucked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one spoke. They only traded tense glances, not daring to decide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long silence, everyone&#39;s eyes landed on Jeff Lee,the main project leader.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man with glasses finally broke the tension. &#34;Jeff,we&#39;ll leave it up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Others quickly followed, echoing his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac watched for a moment, and then calmly ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rose from his seat, braced his hands against the table, and leaned in, his dark eyes never leaving Jeff.&#34;Mr. Lee, where do you stand? Are you open to working with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Jeff felt all the color drain from his face. He could only curse his terrible luck in silence. What was he supposed to do in a situation like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could he even call this a real choice?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With two powerful forces closing in from different corners, Jeff found himself completely boxed in. He knew there was no other option left for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the only path he could take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though his mind raced, his lips refused to move,as if his words had been swallowed by panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside his head, two voices clashed, each one desperate to take control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One urged him, practically shouting,&#34;Say yes already!Partnering with both the Bennett and Sampson families could open doors you never imagined. Miss this, and you&#39;ll be left behind forever, no matter how hard you try to catch up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other voice trembled, filled with dread. &#34;But what about Sherwood? You know how much sway he holds in the south. If you cross him, he won&#39;t hesitate to ruin you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their bickering left Jeff with a pounding headache that refused to let up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scanned the faces of his colleagues, seeing both hope and worry written all over them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their anxious stares felt like a weight pressing down on his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking over at Isaac, he found the man watching him,steady and unyielding, leaving Jeff with nowhere to turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually,Jeff released a long breath, finally making up his mind. He reached out and shook lsaac&#39;s hand.&#34;Mr. Bennett, we&#39;re in. We&#39;ll work with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t look the least bit surprised. He gripped Jeff&#39;s hand and said, &#34;Good call, Mr. Lee. I&#39;m sure this partnership is going to set the project apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While all this was unfolding, Luis had his own matters to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the CEO&#39;s office, he ended his call with Isaac and rubbed his temples, trying to ease the tension building in his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d spent the whole mnorning glued to his desk,eyes fixed on his computer, only taking a short break for lunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis drummed his fingers across the desk, creating a steady rhythm that echoed through the quiet room.Deep in thought, his brows drew together as he mapped out his next move. The audio Howe delivered had become his strongest weapon so far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never wished for Sherwood&#39;s death. That would have been far too simple. Watching Sherwood&#39;s world collapse, forcing him to answer for every sin as the public turned against him-that was the justice Luis wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to put Sherwood behind bars, he needed undeniable proof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver and doctor who were involved in Verena&#39;s disappearance-Luis knew they were the missing pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His assistant, standing at the edge of the desk,waited with patience. &#34;Mr. Sampson, how can I assist you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis met his eyes and gave clear instructions. &#34;Start a thorough investigation on the driver and doctor Howe worked with when he took Verena away. I didn&#39;t care what it cost-track them down. I wanted their locations immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant straightened his posture and took the order seriously. &#34;Understood, sir. I&#39;ll begin at once.Since so much time had passed, there was a chance they&#39;d disappeared, so it might not be easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis didn&#39;t waver. &#34;No matter how hard it gets, you  keep searching. If we have to, widen the search and hire private investigators. Tell them to focus on doctors in the obstetrics department from that period.Check every local hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His assistant nodded quickly, determination in his eyes.&#34;I&#39;ll do everything I can to get results for you right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he turned and quietly exited,closing the door with care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis lingered on the empty doorway for a moment before his focus shifted to the glowing computer screen, its surface scattered with half-formed leads and elusive connections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clues in his grasp were few, but they gave him something to hold onto.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing his fingers to his brow, Luis made a silent vow.&#34;Sherwood, I&#39;ll drag every secret you&#39;re hiding into the light. I swear you&#39;ll answer for all of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in Kirk Group&#39;s gleaming headquarters,Sherwood ended a meeting with a client and stepped out into the hallway just as his phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up the call while making his way down the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Molly. What&#39;s going on?&#34; said Sherwood, his tone laced with a touch of warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s shaky voice spilled through the receiver, thick with panic. &#34;Dad, something awful happened. Verena&#39;s letting people go left and right, and she&#39;s even kicked me out of the company!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood came to a dead stop. The confident grin faded from his lips, replaced by a scowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip on the phone tightened as he struggled to process the words. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage snapped through his voice, much louder now.&#34;Who does she think she is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden outburst startled several employees in the corridor,sending them scurrying away with nervous bows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting another second, Sherwood charged down the hall, burst into the CEO&#39;s office, and slammed the door shut behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming, he shot a glare at the wall and growled, &#34;That woman&#39;s decided to turn against me openly. She doesn&#39;t even bother to hide it anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Sherwood could fully take it in, Molly&#39;s sobs continued. &#34;Dad, there&#39;s more. Verena told me she never actually treated your illness. Every treatment she mentioned-she made it allup.&#34;</p>
