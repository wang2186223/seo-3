                <p>&#34;Once, the real Simon returned to the village where he&#39;d grown up, intending to do a bit of charity work.Out of the blue, he fell ill and breathed his last in a shabby clinic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob paused before going on. &#34;We traced every patient who passed through that clinic at that time and discovered one particularly suspicious man-Carl Aguilar. According to the doctor, Carl shared the same ward with Simon. They weren&#39;t strangers either; their roots tangled deep. They&#39;d known each other since boyhood, even walked the same halls of elementary school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Jacob&#39;s fingers tapped swiftly.&#34;Mr. Bennett, I&#39;ve compiled the full report, including Carl&#39;s background. Our people confirmed he. even turned up at Mrs. Bennett&#39;s hospital in Clokron. But the hospital&#39;s walls were sealed tight-confidentiality like an iron gate. We couldn&#39;t learn what he did inside. I&#39;ve sent the file to your inbox. Please check it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. Got it.&#34; Isaac ended the call, wheeled to his desk, and opened the newest email.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scrolling down, several photos appeared, each one marked with the name Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his eyes landed on them, Isaac narrowed his gaze, body leaning forward as if distance itself could blur the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the image, Carl&#39;s long hair hung in filthy tangles, a nest beaten about by storm winds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dust clung to his bangs, hanging low, veiling most of his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet even through the cracks, a pair of vicious eyes gleamed like knives in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face seemed to have crawled straight out of a gutter-skin hidden under layers of grime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips were split and parched, like barren land fractured by drought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the eye, he looked ordinary, yet something about him unsettled like a shadow that refused to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac frowned, confusion flickering like candlelight in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That face...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did it strike him as familiar?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And along with the recognition came a sharp disgust that pierced without reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Verena hurried to lvan&#39;s door, knocking hard,urgency written in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan answered, surprise on his face. &#34;That was quick...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could finish his words, Verena pulled him inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan blinked, startled by her haste. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena steadied herself, and then said, &#34;Ivan, I tracked down the exact time and place of Isaac&#39;s crash, but every scrap of surveillance is gone. This is your battlefield. Help me recover it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through a yawn, Ivan snapped awake, his eyes sharp. &#34;You mean... you think the crash was no accident?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded solemnly. Ivan thumped his chest.&#34;Then leave it to me. I&#39;ll dig it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the computer room, Ivan slid into his chair, the glow of the monitor throwing light over his angular features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers flew across the keyboard, streams of code spilling like rushing water down the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time slipped away-an hour vanished without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena sat nearby. When his hands finally slowed, his brows were drawn tight as knots. Softly,she asked, &#34;How is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan exhaled heavily. &#34;Harder than expected.Someone planted programs to wipe the footage clean. I&#39;ve hit roadblocks. I&#39;ll need more time to crack through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena quickly reassured him. &#34;That&#39;s fine. Take the time you need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan suggested, &#34;Why don&#39;t you head home? I&#39;ll call once it&#39;s done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At most, how long?&#34; she pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened, pride ringing in his tone. &#34;It&#39;s tough,sure. But who am l? Give me five or six hours, no more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;ll stay here,&#34; Verena replied firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t leave. The thought that the footage might hold the truth about lsaac&#39;s crash had her blood running hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed answers. She needed the hand behind the curtain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she stayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to weigh on Ivan, Verena rose.&#34;I&#39;l wait on the side. Don&#39;t mind me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved to the couch, phone in hand,though her thoughts were far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every so often her eyes darted toward Ivan, nerves and anticipation twisting inside like tangled thread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan refocused, the clatter of keys echoing steadily through the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time dripped by, drop after drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sleep crept up on her. Her eyes closed, head tilting,and the phone slid from her loosened grip into the cushions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Seraphina Villas, lsaac sat at his desk. The paperwork was long finished, tossed aside like discarded notes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lifted to the clock, and a frown cut across his face, unease gnawing at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So late...Why hadn&#39;t Verena returned?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seized his phone and swiftly dialed the bodyguard assigned to Verena. &#34;Where is she? Is she coming home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard outside lvan&#39;s place answered uneasily,&#34;No, sir. Mrs. Bennett went inside with a young man wearing an ear stud. She hasn&#39;t come out...it&#39;s been over four hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he quickly added, &#34;She called him lvan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s grip tightened until his knuckles whitened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His Adam&#39;s apple bobbed as his voice came out rough, like sandpaper dragged over stone. &#34;Got it.Stay there. Protect her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering his gaze, his thick lashes cast faint shadows,veiling the storm of emotions swirling in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went to see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s chest clenched, every beat a thorn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bitterness spread, yet the memory of Verena&#39;s eyes came back to him-clear, steady, hiding nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had told him straight she had something to do,even allowed bodyguards to follow. No trace of deceit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been nothing but honest. He ought to trust her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knowledge that she&#39;d been with her first love for hours still left jealousy gnawing at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He urged himself to trust Verena. Whatever she was doing, it must matter. Reason clawed at him,whispering sense. Yet emotion raged untamed-jealousy and unease flooding in like a tide that knew no shore.</p>
