                <p>Hearing Luther&#39;s words, Isaac felt a flicker of confusion. He furrowed his brow and asked, &#34;How do you know that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther gave a slight tit of his head, his gaze shifting to the display rack beside the bookshelf. &#34;It&#39;s simple,&#34; he said quietly. &#34;There&#39;s your wedding photo with your wife, and another photo with your father. The way they&#39;re placed together speaks volumes about the bond you share.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac followed Luther&#39;s line of sight to the photograph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been taken long before his accident, during a casual outing with his father, captured by a professional photographer who walked by them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac and his father weren&#39;t ones for photos. This was the only one that seemed to pulse with life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the image, his father&#39;s hand rested on Isaac&#39;s shoulder, a broad grin lighting up his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Teenage Isaac appeared carefree, a soft smile lingering at the edges of his lips. A sliver of sunlight cut through the frame, giving the moment a serene glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze softened as he took it all in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded slowly, a hint of pride weaving ino his voice. &#34;Yeah, my dad and I, we got along great. To me,he&#39;s the best father anyone could ask for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the shift in Isaac&#39;s expression and tone,Luther smiled warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a good sign, seeing Isaac open up, even just a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a slow sip of his coffee, Luther leaned in slightly and remarked in a calm, soothing tone,&#34;I don&#39;t often come across father-son bonds like yours.Care to share any funny or memorable stories from your time together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac blinked, falling into a quiet pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther wasn&#39;t surprised by his silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t pressure Isaac to respond, nor did he fix his gaze on him. Instead, he poured himself another cup of coffee, savoring it slowly and complimenting its quality, as though the conversation was nothing more than a casual observation with no hidden intent. With his easygoing nature and unhurried way of speaking,Luther made it feel like lsaac wasn&#39;t being rushed into anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, Isaac relaxed, his guard slipping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused for a moment, his gaze lifting slowly, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his lips as memories surged back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My father was never like the traditional image of a dad. He wasn&#39;t cold or strict. He was always kind,with a smile for me, no matter what. He and my mother were opposites in so many ways. For him, family always came before anything else. When I was sick as a kid, my mom would check on me quickly and then go back to her work, leaving me with the servants.But not my dad.&#34; Isaac&#39;s eyes grew softer, his expression almost distant. &#34;Whenever I was unwell,no matter what clients he had or how busy his day was,he&#39;d leave everything behind. He&#39;d rush home to sit with me, make sure I took my medicine, wipe the sweat from my forehead. He wouldn&#39;t go back to work until I was fully recovered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued, &#34;With my mother, there was no room for mistakes. But my father always told me that mistakes were part of life, and that as long as I could learn from them, it was all right. From childhood to adulthood,whatever I decided, he was always there-  supporting me, encouraging me. What meant the most to him was spending time with us. He never missed a birthday, no matter what. Even if work kept him late, he&#39;d make sure to show up, just so he could be with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was a little rough but held a warmth that was undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther gently intertwined his fingers on his lap,his eyes steady on lsaac&#39;s. &#34;It sounds like your father really cared for you. Most fathers aren&#39;t like that, Mr.Bennett. They value independence over everything else. You&#39;re very lucky to have had such a devoted father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac let out a soft chuckle, nodding in agreement.&#34;Yes,my father is truly a wonderful man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words hung in the air for a moment, before his gaze dropped to his legs. His eyes began to shimmer,and the once-clear world around him blurred into a haze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther, with his years of experience as a psychologist,recognized the shift instantly. He knew that calling upon cherished memories often led to an undercurrent of longing, and sometimes even guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting the conversation, Luther tossed out a lighthearted question. &#34;Mr. Bennett, you strike me as a man of strong will. Your father, it seems, couldn&#39;t quite bring himself to discipline you. But your mother -was she more inclined to take on that role?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac chuckled, a brief, amused sound escaping him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther,ever the master at reading the room, steered the conversation subtly. In their easy banter,he picked up on more of Isaac&#39;s state than he had expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the conversation seemed to reach its natural end, Luther felt it was the right moment to take his leave. He set his cup down, stood with a fluid grace,and said warmly, &#34;Mr. Bennett, it&#39;s been a pleasure.I must be off now. Thank you for your time today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac looked up at him, a moment of hesitation flickering in his eyes, clearly caught off guJard by how swiftly the session had come to a close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually, a therapy session would stretch for at least an hour or two, but this one barely hit forty minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than that, there was no weight lifting off his shoulders, no sense of release like he was accustomed to after these meetings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, it felt like a casual chat-no pressure, no psychological burden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s lips curved into a subtle smile as he turned to Luther. &#34;Thank you, Dr. Owen. Let me show you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena was lounging on the sofa in the living room,casually reading her newspaper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she heard the elevator doors slide open, she glanced up, lowering the paper as she saw lsaac and Luther come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All done already?&#34; she asked, raising an eyebrow in surprise. She hadn&#39;t even finished the newspaper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther ran a hand over his beard, his smile widening as he nodded. &#34;That&#39;s it for today&#39;s session. I&#39;ve got some things to take care of,so I&#39;ll be heading out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stood and walked over, offering him a polite smile. &#34;Alright, let me show you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, Isaac and Verena accompanied Luther to the front gates, watching him climb into his car before it pulled away. Once the car disappeared from view,Verena turned her attention back to Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He appeared calm, more relaxed than he had been earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she couldn&#39;t shake the doubt lingering in her mind about the brevity of the session.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a thoughtful look, she crouched slightly,her voice soft but inquisitive. &#34;Isaac, what did you think of Dr.Owen?&#34; Isaac glanced up, his eyes momentarily catching the light. A flicker of something passed through his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking back to the fond memories he had shared of his father during their conversation, he replied with certainty, &#34;Verena, you&#39;ve found a really good psychologist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brief response brought a wave of relief to Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been concerned that Isaac might resist the new psychologist, unsure of whether he would warm up to someone unfamiliar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now,hearing him speak so positively about Luther,it was clear that lsaac had accepted him, which was a good sign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They made their way to the second floor. Isaac returned to his study to dive back into his work, while Verena headed to the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing by the floor-to-ceiling window,she pulled out her phone and dialed Luther&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Owen, it&#39;s Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther wasn&#39;t caught off guard. It wasn&#39;t unusualfor family members to want a private conversation about a patient&#39;s progress, away from the patient&#39;s ears. Without wasting time, he got straight to the point.&#34;Mrs. Bennett, Mr. Bennett&#39;s condition may seem straightforward, but it&#39;s actually much more complex and difficult to treat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s heart dropped at his words. While she was aware of lsaac&#39;s struggles, hearing Luther&#39;s blunt assessment made the weight of the situation feel heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow furrowed as she waited, silently bracing for whatever he would say next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, Luther&#39;s deep, steady voice broke the silence. &#34;Mr. Bennett and his father had a bond that was even stronger than I had expected. But with such closeness came an overwhelming sense of guilt.It became clear to me during our talk that he feels responsible for his father&#39;s death. I could almost feel him asking himself why his father had to die in that car accident, instead of him. This constant self-blame weighs heavily on him, like a chain he can&#39;t escape,keeping him from confronting the truth. That&#39;s why,even after the surgery&#39;s success, he still struggles to walk normally.&#34; Luther let out a long sigh and added,&#34;He&#39;s been torturing himself over this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes welled up as she thought about Isaac&#39;s usual silence, the way he always carried such heavy burdens alone. A deep sorrow tightened in her chest She took a shaky breath, fighting back the tears, and spoke to Luther on the phone. &#34;Dr. Owen, my husband&#39;s condition is far more complicated than it seems. I&#39;ll be depending on you moving forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther&#39;s voice was steady and reassuring. &#34;It&#39;s my job.You can count on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, inside the CEO&#39;s office of Bennett Group, Jacob stood holding a report, detailing the company&#39;s affairs from the last two days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words were laced with concern, his brows drawn together in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the man across from him remained as calm as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac sat at his desk, one hand supporting his weary head,his fingers gently massaging his brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared blankly at the papers spread before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Jacob finished speaking, he looked at Isaac,whose posture was slightly slouched, making it hard to gauge his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long, tense silence, it was clear that lsaac had no intention of speaking first. Jacob opened his mouth, and then hesitated, unsure how to proceed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Isaac&#39;s voice cut through the stillness. &#34;Say what&#39;s on your mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That simple prompt was all it took to release the tension. Jacob could no longer hold back his frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Bennett, Luis Sampson is completely out of line.He&#39;s blatantly disregarding business ethics!&#34; Jacob blurted out, his voice rising with urgency.</p>
