                <p>Verena&#39;s sudden questions threw Luis off balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised a hand and rubbed at his brow with his thumb, a flicker of unease settling over his face as his brows drew together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long before this meeting, he had suspected that Verena&#39;s disappearance hadn&#39;t been an accident at all.More likely, it was a carefully planned scheme by someone with a darker agenda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But suspicion was all it had ever been. He hadn&#39;t dug deeply enough to uncover the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after Verena laid her questions out plainly did Luis begin to grasp just how tangled things really were,leaving him uneasy and at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leading the country&#39;s underground forces had earned him more than his share of enemies through the years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just within their hometown, Ochrerayd, countless people bore grudges against him and the Sampson name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he mulled it over, the idea of a targeted plot</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Air India Flights Resume seemed far more likely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp breath slipped from him as the realization sank in. He shot Verena a quick glance, quietly gauging her reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she learned just how many enemies their family had accumulated,would she begin to resent them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made his head pound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He massaged his temples, sifting through the endless list of factions that had crossed the Sampson family over the years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the further he dug through his memories, the wider the circle grew, and the harder it became to pinpoint who might be responsible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing his throat, Luis finally answered, &#34;Verena,you&#39;ve put me in a difficult position. You know the Sampson family&#39;s influence in the underworld.We&#39;ve naturally made plenty of enemies. If we&#39;re talking about people who hate us, there are too many to count.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a weary shake of his head, a strained smile tugging at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that, Verena caught on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed, and her fists tightened against the  table. Her voice came out cold and sharp. &#34;No matter who it is, I won&#39;t let the one who destroyed our family escape. If someone despises the Sampson family that much, then now that I&#39;ve resurfaced, they won&#39;t be able to resist making a move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drew in a steady breath before speaking again.&#34;Luis, announce that I&#39;ve returned to the Sampson family. Host a party. We&#39;ll appear together, and you&#39;ll introduce me to everyone in Ochrerayd. Let the news spread everywhere. I don&#39;t believe the person hiding in the shadows will sit quietly once they hear it. When they make their move, we&#39;ll finally have a trail to follow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; face grew grim as her plan sank in. &#34;That would put you right back in danger. I can&#39;t allow it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught himself, realizing his tone was too sharp,and spoke more gently. &#34;Verena, this is reckless. I understand your determination to uncover the truth and avenge the family, but what if they act out of desperation and target you again? Our parents and I could never bear to see you hurt once more. Even the smallest risk is too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brother&#39;s worry filled Verena with warmth, butit didn&#39;t shake her resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laid her hand lightly over his, her voice calm yet unwavering. &#34;Luis, waiting around only gives them the  upper hand. Right now, we know nothing about our enemy, and neither do they about our intentions. If we stay passive, how will we ever unmask the one responsible? I refuse to let them keep roaming free,endangering our family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, and then leaned in, her eyes locking onto his with a faint, steady smile. &#34;Tell me, Luis,don&#39;t you trust your own ability to protect me? I do. If we prepare carefully, I believe you&#39;ll keep me safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; brows knitted tighter as her words cut through him,his heart pulled in two directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he ever doubt his ability to protect his sister?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plan was dangerous, and Luis knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the smallest risk to Verena&#39;s safety was something he could never take lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the determination in her eyes made it impossible to voice his rejection outright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uneasy, he dragged both hands down his face, trying to steady his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally spoke, his voice was lowbut firm.&#34;Verena, it isn&#39;t a matter of confidence. Aside from Mom,you are the most important woman in my life.This situation is unpredictable. We have no idea what</p>
                
                
                
                <p>moves they&#39;ll make. If anything went wrong, I would regret it for the rest of my days. Please, hear me out.Let&#39;s consider other ways to flush them out while keeping you safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hesitation unsettled Verena, though her resolve did not waver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew deep down that her plan was the only path forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luis, I know you&#39;re worried. I won&#39;t pretend I&#39;m fearless, but whoever took me back then clearly knew our family inside and out. NNow that I&#39;ve already reunited with you and our parents, they likely already know. Waiting quietly will only give them more opportunities. Finding out who they are is worth the risk to me. We can surround me with guards and prepare for every possibility. And remember,you&#39;re not the only one protecting me. Isaac won&#39;t allow harm to come my way either. Trust me, Luis. Nothing will happen. Please agree.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long while, he said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Luis&#39; gaze deepened, and he gave a reluctant nod. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll agree. But you must swear to follow my lead. Every precaution I set in place, you obey. If something feels wrong, don&#39;t act brave; get behind me immediately. Do you understand?&#34; Verena&#39;s lips curved into a small smile, and she nodded.&#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Ochrerayd, the press conference hall gleamed under the light of a massive crystal chandelier, its brilliance spilling across every corner of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A red carpet unfurled from the entrance all the way to the stage, lined with fresh, colorful blooms that released a faint, sweet fragrance into the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uniformed security guards maintained strict order,pacing the perimeter with sharp eyes to ensure nothing disrupted the event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every touch revealed just how much effort the Sampson family had invested in this occasion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Journalists from leading outlets had poured in from all directions, buzzing with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even before the press conference, clusters of reporters were already locked in spirited conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One veteran from a major newspaper adjusted his glasses, his brow furrowed. &#34;This press conference from the Sampson family is baffling. Not a single detail leaked beforehand. All they said was that an announcement would be made. I&#39;ve covered stories  for years, but I&#39;ve never seen secrecy handled this tightly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A young woman known for her celebrity scoops tested her microphone and chimed in, &#34;I know, right?I&#39;ve been digging through all my contacts these past few days, and not a shred of useful information came out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another reporter specializing in entertainment news added quickly, &#34;Same here! Normally, when powerful families make a move, some rumor always escapes.But this time, the Sampsons have sealed everything shut. Not a word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A business reporter folded his arms, thinking aloud.&#34;The Sampsons are known for playing it safe. If they&#39;ve gone all out with a press conference like this,it&#39;s got to be tied to something big. Maybe they&#39;re about to unveil a major partnership?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost immediately, Stan Juarez,a local reporter from Ochrerayd, cut in, &#34;I don&#39;t buy it. If it were about business, they&#39;d have leaked teasers to build hype and stir up market confidence. This feels more like a private matter within the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The back-and-forth only heightened the energy,curiosity mounting with every exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, a staff member stepped on stage to announce that the conference was about to begin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chatter died down instantly. Reporters readied their equipment, eyes trained on the platform, waiting for the revelation.</p>
