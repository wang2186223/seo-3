                <p>Inside the car, Verena settled into the seat,letting out a soft sigh before shaking her head at Isaac. &#34;Simon&#39;s too cautious,&#34; she murmured, her voice tinged with frustration. &#34;I&#39;ve&#39; tried everything, but I still can&#39;t find any clear answers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac turned toward her, his hand gently resting on her shoulder as he spoke in a soothing tone. &#34;Don&#39;t worry,we&#39;ll take our time. His carefulness means he&#39;s hiding something. But in the end, everyone slips, no matter how meticulous they are. Secrets always find their way out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words, warm and reassuring, eased some of Verena&#39;s tension, though the worry in her eyes lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found her gaze drifting outside the car window,her mind still restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The city skyline stretched in the distance, a sea of tall buildings cutting through the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People hurried along the streets, while cars zoomed past in a blur. Her mind was a whirlwind of thoughts, each one racing back to the conversation with Simon,replaying every detail as though it was happening in real-time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze was sharp and unreadable, and his words were so carefully chosen that she found herself with no way to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was desperate to uncover who was behind Shawna&#39;s murder and Isaac&#39;s accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew she needed to act, and fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, unaware that his car crash had been no accident,assumed her current demeanor was because she regretted not finding Shawna&#39;s killer sooner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled her closer, his arm wrapping around her shoulders as he spoke softly. &#34;Verena, trust me. We&#39;ll keep pushing. A breakthrough will come, and when it does, we&#39;ll make sure Shawna gets justice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena met his gaze and nodded quietly. &#34;We&#39;ll do it together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts were resolute. She was determined to uncover the truth, not only for her grandmother but for lsaac as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She repeated the promise to herself, her resolve growing stronger with each passing moment. At Seraphina Villas, Verena pulled out her phone and made a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call connected, she spoke politely. &#34;Hello,Dr. Owen. This is VVerena. We had scheduled my husband&#39;s psychological treatment, but I understand there was a delay. Could you let me know when we can proceed with the treatment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s treatment had been scheduled to begin once Luther landed in Shoildon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the day after Luther&#39;s flight landed, he sent Verena a message explaining that urgent matters had come up, causing a delay in starting the treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A week passed, and with no updates, Verena decided to take matters into her own hands and called Luther herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice greeted her apologetically. &#34;I&#39;m truly sorry,Mrs. Bennett. I had an emergency case that needed my attention, and that&#39;s why there&#39;s been a delay.I hope you can forgive me for the inconvenience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft smile, Verena spoke in a calm tone. &#34;Dr.Owen, you&#39;re simply doing your job. As a doctor myself,I understand how important it is to prioritize.&#34; Luther let out a warm laugh. &#34;You&#39;re incredibly understanding. Ivan has really made a wonderful friend in you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Verena had a chance to respond, he added, &#34;If it&#39;s convenient for you, I can set things up immediately and begin your husband&#39;s psychological treatment. How does that sound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Verena wasn&#39;t required at the hospital today and Isaac was working from home, she agreed, &#34;That works perfectly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious, she asked, &#34;Dr. Owen, where would the treatment take place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His response was steady. &#34;There&#39;s no need for a specific location. The treatment should happen somewhere the patient feels comfortable and safe.What matters most is that it&#39;s a place where he can let down his guard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of a comfortable and safe place lingered in Verena&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she realized that for lsaac, home would be the only place where he could truly relax and open up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, Verena knocked softly on Isaac&#39;s study door. He looked up from his paperwork, his gaze shifting to her. &#34;Verena, what&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked over, gently took his hand, and knelt down beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up into his eyes, her voice soft, she said,&#34;Isaac, I just spoke with Luther. I gave him our address,and he&#39;ll be here in an hour for your treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, Isaac was taken aback,his grip on her hand tightening without thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his reaction, Verena softly asked, &#34;Isaac, are you afraid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head quickly, his gaze filled with a mix of emotions. &#34;I&#39;m not afraid, just a little nervous.But with you here, I&#39;m okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes held a blend of uncertainty and emotion,speaking volumes without a single word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac felt a strong desire to begin the treatment,hoping to free himself from the weight of his internal struggles and finally stand before Verena as a man unburdened,ready to protect her from any harm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But doubts clouded his mind. He worried he might fail,that he could never live up to her expectations. The fear of waiting endlessly without results, and the terror of facing the truth gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the storm of emotions in his eyes, Verena leaned in, gently pressing his hand against her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac,&#34; she said, her voice soft and soothing. &#34;No matter what happens, I won&#39;t care. We&#39;re a team, and that bond won&#39;t ever change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words, tender and reassuring, echoed in his heart,leaving a lasting ripple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted her face gently, his lips brushing against her forehead in a soft kiss. &#34;Okay,&#34; he whispered. &#34;I&#39;ll change and get ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant&#39;s announcement echoed through the house. Luther had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting by the living room entrance, Verena and Isaac watched as a burly, bearded man in his middle years entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved with purpose, his calm demeanor giving off an air of authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena extended her hand in greeting. &#34;Dr. Owen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a warm smile, Luther took her hand and said,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Bennett, you&#39;re even more beautiful in person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena returned the smile, her voice polite.&#34;Thank you,Dr.Owen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then gestured to Isaac. &#34;This is my husband,Isaac Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac met Luther&#39;s gaze, offering a small smile as he greeted. &#34;Hello,Dr.Owen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther raised an eyebrow in surprise, his admiration clear as he gave lsaac a thumbs-up. &#34;Mr. Bennett,you&#39;re not just good-looking, but you&#39;re so young,too.I&#39;ve heard you hold a big part of Shoildon&#39;s finances.You&#39;re impressive!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Business news was something Luther regularly kept up with, so a successful figure like Isaac was always on his radar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting Isaac in person left Luther in awe of his impressive accomplishments at such a young age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gave a modest nod, his smile soft. &#34;Dr. Owen,you&#39;re too generous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther laughed, shaking his head in good-natured disbelief. &#34;Mr. Bennett, you&#39;re too humble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked first at Verena, and then turned to lsaac.&#34;Mr. Bennett, are you ready to begin? Should we start  the treatment now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, Dr. Owen,&#34; Verena said with a nod. &#34;Please follow me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gently wheeled Isaac toward the elevator,with Luther following closely behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They ascended to the second floor and made their way into the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Verena, Luther spoke. &#34;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll need you to step out for a moment, Mrs.Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded in understanding, bending down to plant a kiss on Isaac&#39;s cheek before offering a smile.&#34;Believe in yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and walked out of the room without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft click echoed as the door closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes remained fixed on the door for a moment,unaware that Luther was quietly observing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac snapped out of his thoughts at the sound of Luther&#39;s voice, his gaze shifting toward him with curiosity. Luther held a porcelain cup in his hand, offering a friendly smile as he asked, &#34;Would you care for a cup of coffee?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He carried himself with ease, as though greeting an old friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gave a subtle nod, accepting the offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After pouring a cup of coffee, Luther handed it over and settled onto the sofa across from Isaac, smiling.&#34;I heard your wife has helped heal your legs, and there&#39;s no major issue now. With timne,I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll make a full recovery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where Simon would have jumped into questions,Luther took a different approach. His voice was calm and confident, with no trace of interrogation, as though he were simply chatting with a friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gave a small nod, his voice quiet. &#34;Yes, but I still can&#39;t stand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther took a moment to blow on his coffee,his voice steady. &#34;That&#39;s perfectly natural. Everyone has their own challenges, their own stories.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze met his, a flicker of surprise passing through his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther didn&#39;t push for more? &#34;Mr. Bennett, you must have shared a close bond with your father, am I right?&#34; Luther asked, continuing the conversation.</p>
