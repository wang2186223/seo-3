                <p>Slater immediately complained with a pout, &#34;Isaac,you can&#39;t imagine how much he despised me. I pretended to twist my ankle and deliberately fell against him, but he only shoved me aside. Later, I held his hand and even asked for his number. Not only did he refuse, but he also shook me off with such disgust-as though he had swallowed something bitter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes flickered slightly. He had always harbored doubts about Simon&#39;s inclination toward men,yet after this attempt, even he found himself somewhat taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s hardly the whole story,&#34; Bobby interjected mysteriously, lifting his brow. &#34;You didn&#39;t see what happened after that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater knitted his brows, curiosity aroused. &#34;What else happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby straightened and turned to Isaac. &#34;After Slater tested Simon, I grew curious and trailed him into the underground garage. Guess what?&#34; He paused deliberately before continuing. &#34;The very first thing Simon did was toss his jacket into the trash, and then rush to scrub his hands, muttering under his breath,&#39;Hell no. That guy is definitely into men. That&#39;s just  messed up.&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Isaac could speak, Slater erupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable! I forced myself to swallow my revulsion and didn&#39;t despise him, yet he dared to despise me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby burst into gleeful laughter, almost bending over with the force of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when lsaac&#39;s face hardened, Bobby quickly sobered,cleared his throat, and asked seriously,&#34;Isaac,why did you send Slater to test him? What&#39;s the real purpose here? Does this man threaten you somehow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac did not wish to drag Bobby into tangled conflicts.With a calm glance, he replied, &#34;Mind your studies instead of poking your nose into matters better left alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby fell silent, stung into wordlessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, he had asked Slater about Isaac&#39;s reasons,but Slater admitted Isaac had explained nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, even pressing lsaac directly, he met the same wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the disappointment etched across Bobby&#39;s face,Isaac said firmly, &#34;That&#39;s enough. You both may leave now.&#34; Slater nodded. &#34;Alright, Isaac. We&#39;ll see you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he tugged Bobby&#39;s sleeve, leading him from the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the door closed, silence settled back into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac clasped his hands together, fingers tapping lightly against the desk as his expression deepened in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier,he had asked Stevie to investigate Simon,who had even produced photos of Simon with a former male partner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,judging by what Slater and Bobby/had described,Simon&#39;s reactions made little sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he truly had once desired men, even if his heart had shifted toward women later, he would not have denounced his own past so harshly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For desire of that kind was not a coat to be worn and shed at whim; it was etched into one&#39;s nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man who had once loved men would not recoil in such disgust-especially when faced with someone like Slater, who fit the very type Simon had preferred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pondered quietly. Something suspicious lurked beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips pressed into a thin line, brows furrowing,though his gaze remained unnervingly steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could twist a person&#39;s nature so dramatically?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac blinked, his eyes dark and contemplative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two possibilities emerged: perhaps Simon had suffered deep wounds from a same-sex relationshipin the past, or perhaps the man standing before them now was not Simon at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Verena fainted,she remained in the hospital for two days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During that time, Danica visited frequently,each time arriving with a pot of nourishing soup she had carefully prepared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Verena grew weary of drinking them, she couldn&#39;t turn away Danica&#39;s kindness in the face of such earnest care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, on the first afternoon after she collapsed,Verena wanted to return to her work once the IV drip ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But under Danica and Isaac&#39;s unyielding insistence,she had no choice but to rest those two days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, on the afternoon of the second day, she was cleared for discharge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac peeled an apple with quiet patience and handed it to Verena. She bit into it, her smile blooming like sunlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her bright eyes curved with joy, and Isaac felt a gentle stirring in his chest. &#34;You look truly happy,&#34; he said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded, her grin unwavering. &#34;At last, I can go back to work. My grandmother&#39;s matter has already been delayed two days-it mustn&#39;t wait any longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she promised to care for herself, Isaac knew her mind had been tied to Shawna&#39;s murder the entire time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking her hand, he said gently, &#34;Verena, Shawna&#39;s case is complicated. It won&#39;t be solved overnight.Even if you return to work, put your health first. Leave Shawna&#39;s matter to me. You just look after yourself -and our baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze softened, brimming with warmth and happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac considered everything on her behalf,arranging every detail, making her truly feel the essence of happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the room, Simon arrived to visit. Yet just as he was about to enter, his eyes fell on the tender sight within: Isaac pressing Verena&#39;s hand against his face,the two wrapped in intimacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon froze, pulling back into the shadow of the doorframe, his gaze fixed upon them, his heart twisting as theirs entwined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lowered her eyes, stroking her belly tenderly.In a hushed tone, she whispered, &#34;Baby.&#34; Then, looking at lsaac, she asked, &#34;What name shall we give our child?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pondered, and then shook his head with a faint smile. &#34;No name comes to mind yet. But they are ours,and I&#39;ll be sure to give them a name like no other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned forward, pressing a gentle kiss to her forehead.&#34;One day,we&#39;ll watch them grow-babbling,taking their first steps, falling in love, marrying, and starting a family. The three of us will know the truest joy this world has to offer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their smiles met in quiet harmony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Simon&#39;s hand clamped onto the doorframe,his knuckles whitening as his nails dug deep into the wood. His eyes widened, his face contorted in a twisted rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What foolish dream was this? What fantasy was Isaac weaving?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon was certain Verena&#39;s future belonged to him alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His glare burned into Isaac, so full of venom it seemed capable of tearing him apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaw clenched,Simon swore silently to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Isaac would be crushed. Whether his proud name or his fragile life-Simon vowed to strip it all away.</p>
