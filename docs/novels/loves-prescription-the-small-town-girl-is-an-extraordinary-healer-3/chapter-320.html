                <p>Molly chewed on her lower lip, her fingers nervously twisting togethner as she spoke. &#34;Look, I shouldn&#39;t have said what I did at the party. It wasn&#39;t fair. The truth is,I care about Luis, probably more than I should.When I saw you playing matchmaker, I got jealous and said things I didn&#39;t mean. I admit it. I really do like him. But I&#39;d never try to force him into anything. I just keep hoping he&#39;ll feel the same way about me one day. I&#39;ve known Luis my whole life,Verena. I know what he wants, and it&#39;s definitely not your friend. You might not see it, but he&#39;s only going along with your plan because you&#39;re his sister. Luis never does anything he truly doesn&#39;t want to do. Maybe my feelings don&#39;t matter to you, but you should at least think about his.Your friend&#39;s gorgeous, sure, but she&#39;s not his type.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, with her years of experience, saw straight through Molly&#39;s reasoning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word seemed wrapped in concern for Luis, but the real motive was painfully clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Molly had insisted, Luis never did anything he didn&#39;t want to do. If he truly disliked Miranda, nothing and no one could push him into spending time with  her, not even his own sister. No matter how much Verena tried to nudge them together,Luis would have found a way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lips curved into a knowing smile as she met Molly&#39;s gaze. &#34;Miss Kirk, I can see how much you care about him. But let&#39;s be honest, if Luis isn&#39;t interested,no amount of matchmaking would matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened, confidence radiating from her. &#34;But have you noticed? He&#39;s still on the balcony, talking to Miranda right now. I didn&#39;t force him into that. All I did was pass on a message for them. The rest was his choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly traced Verena&#39;s line of sight until her eyes landed on the far edge of the balcony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis stood faintly outlined in the night, phone in hand as he listened closely to the voice on the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A twist of jealousy pinched at her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly spoke with a trace of reluctance in her voice,but no words of protest came to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d convinced herself that Luis was only being polite for Verena&#39;s sake. Now, watching him there,she wasn&#39;t so sure. ena&#39;s words gave Molly pause, and for a moment,found herself reluctantly nodding. Maybe there s some truth in what Verena said, even if it stung.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ticing Molly&#39;s crestfallen look, Verena&#39;s tone ftened, though she remained firm. &#34;Miss Kirk, the eart never bends to anyone&#39;s will. Sometimes,the est thing we can do is let go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.cross the room, Sherwood rose from his seat and lasped Joseph&#39;s hand in farewell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph answered with warmth in his tone, and once their short exchange ended, Sherwood turned his eyes toward Molly and Verena, who stood a little distance away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>bHe lifted his voice slightly and called out, &#34;Molly, the hour&#39;s getting late. Let&#39;s make our way back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly hesitated, biting her lip before straightening her shoulders. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll be right there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made her way back inside the living room,her steps heavy with resignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Luis finished his call and drifted over to Verena, passing her phone back with a smooth,easy motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena accepted the phone, feeling the lingering q varmth of the device.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>jhe tried to catch a hint of what he&#39;d discussed with Miranda,searching his eyes for clués.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Luis simply smiled, the same mysterious glint in his eyes as always, refusing to reveal a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>9After Sherwood and Molly left, the evening wound down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marisa, true to habit, slipped away to her room early,fighting back yawns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis offered a quick goodnight before heading off for a much-needed shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph guided Verena and Isaac upstairs, his voice warm and kind. &#34;Verena, Isaac, this room is all set for you. You&#39;ve both gone above and beyond today. Get some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena offered a grateful smile as she guided Isaac&#39;s wheelchair to the door. &#34;Thank you, Dad. You should rest, too. It&#39;s been a long day for all of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gave Joseph a courteous nod and said,&#34;Thank you,Joseph. Have a good night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph returned their goodnights with a wave and slipped quietly down the hall.Verena pushed the wooden door inward, and a wave of soft warmth welcomed her in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Muted cream tones stretched across the room like a quiet whisper, broken only by the presence of a few graceful landscape paintings that added just enough charm without shouting for attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the center stood a wide, inviting bed,its pale yellow cover stitched with faint, intricate patterns that caught the light like threads of sunlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Low lamps flanked each side of the bed, their gentle glow spilling over the room like honey, wrapping everything in a hush of comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall wardrobe along the wall brought the faint scent of cedar to the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, a writing desk sat beneath a window,moonlight falling across a vase of lilies. Their fragrance drifted through the room, delicate and soothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cushioned sofa occupied the corner by the glass,perfectly positioned for quiet reading or gazing at the garden below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On a dainty table rested porcelain coffee cups and several slim volumes of poetry,their covers well-worn and loved. spacious walk-in closet stood open in one corner,is shelves and racks neatly organized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to her old room at the Willis Villa, this place felt twice as large and infinitely warmer.Every detail spoke of care, chosen for her, not out of habit,but out oflove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lingered in the doorway, eyes bright with emotion as gratitude washed over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac noticed her silence, and then wrapped her hand in his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His touch was steady and warm. &#34;You have more than just me now, Verena. From this day on, you belong to two families, both ready to welcome you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met his gaze, tears shimmering but refusing to fall. For the first time, she truly felt the weight of being loved from all sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had parents who cherished her, a brother who never failed to make her smile, and a husband whose patience never wore thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena drew in a steadying breath and smiled through the last of her tears. &#34;I think I&#39;ll go run a bath. It&#39;s been a long day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could turn away, Isaac gently caught her  wrist. &#34;Hold on,&#34; he said, eyes suddenly intent.&#34;There&#39;s something I&#39;ve been wanting to ask you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprised by the shift in his tone, she turned back,tilting her head as if to say, Go on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her, sincerity written all over his face.&#34;Tell me, what exactly did Sherwood do for your family? Everyone in your family seems to owe him,but I never heard the full story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question caught Verena off guard. She hadn&#39;t imagined Isaac would bring that up so suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, and then answered softly, &#34;After l vanished, my father could barely keep himself together, let alone run the company. Luis, still so young, was forced into the chaos. People in the company refused to take him seriously, and things unraveled quickly. It was Sherwood who stepped up.He took Luis under his wing,showed him how to lead,and handled every storm that hit the business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s voice turned gentle. &#34;With Sherwood&#39;s support and his standing in the industry, he brought calm to the turmoil and made sure Sampson Group survived. Dad never forgot what Sherwood did for us,and neither has any Sampson family member. Our family owes him a debt we&#39;ll always remember.&#34;</p>
