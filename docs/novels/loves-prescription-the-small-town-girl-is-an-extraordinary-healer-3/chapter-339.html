                <p>The night had draped itself over the city like a heavy cloak. After finishing his evening engagements,Sherwood finally returned home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He eased himself onto the couch and reached for the honey water a servant had thoughtfully prepared,sipping gently as though to clear the cobwebs from his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Molly asleep?&#34; Sherwood asked in a measured tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant inclined her head and replied with respect,&#34;She came back in the evening and went upstairs after dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood gave a brief nod. &#34;You may go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acknowledging the order,the servant withdrew quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a short rest, Sherwood took out his phone and dialed a familiar number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Joseph,&#34; he greeted warmly. &#34;Forgive me for calling so late-hopefully I&#39;m not disturbing your rest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s voice, easy and familiar like an old  companion, answered with a smile in his tone,&#34;Sherwood! No, I&#39;m still awake. What&#39;s on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood chuckled lightly, masking his intent with small talk. &#34;Oh, nothing urgent. Just thought I&#39;d chat a while. Don&#39;t you usually sleep early? Haven&#39;t been feeling unwell,I hope?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Joseph laughed, his amusement carrying through the receiver. &#34;Not at all. I&#39;ve been taking the medicine Verena prepared, and my health has improved greatly. Perhaps it&#39;s her presence at home that makes me so light-hearted. Even though she&#39;s right here with us, I can&#39;t help thinking about her -strange how joy itself can keep one awake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s smile faltered for a breath, but he quickly regained his warmth. &#34;Indeed, Verena is both thoughtful and capable. It&#39;s a comfort knowing she looks after you so well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s laughter grew more buoyant,laced with pride.&#34;Yes, in the twinkling of an eye,Verena has grown to the point of caring for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood responded with a genial smnile, &#34;Indeed,she&#39;s younger than Luis, but she&#39;s the first to start a family. Joseph, it won&#39;t be long before you can cuddle your first grandchild.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, shifting his tone to a lighter note, he added,  &#34;Speaking of which, both Luis and Molly have already reached the age for marriage. Time waits for no one,does it not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing his eyes slightly, Sherwood leaned back on the couch, nostalgia threading through his voice. &#34;Do you recall when they were children? Whenever they stood side by side, we would half-jest, half-believe,saying they were a match made in heaven.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused deliberately, allowing Joseph a moment of reflection, before continuing, &#34;Joseph, let me be plain.What do you think of arranging their marriage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph was momentarily taken aback, and then burst out laughing. &#34;Sherwood, I truly admire Molly-she&#39;s kind, sensible, and capable. But Luis has always charted his own course. As his father, my influence is not as strong as you might think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone carried a trace of complaint yet overflowed with paternal affection. &#34;Still, if he agrees, I will wholeheartedly support the union.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood drained the last of his honey water,replying with a touch of humor, &#34;Luis neither agrees nor refuses. Curiously, though, wherever he goes-be it business or leisure-he never fails to bring gifts back for Molly. Slowly, he has captured her heart,and now she waits each day for his word.&#34; Joseph frowned slightly, his voice tinged with reproach. &#34;Luis is too vague with his feelings. To leave a girl in suspense-it&#39;s hardly fair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood sighed softly, but Joseph quickly tempered his tone, as if to console him. &#34;Don&#39;t worry,Sherwood.Knowing Luis, if he weren&#39;t interested, he wouldn&#39;t trouble himself with such gestures. At work he&#39;s as decisive as lightning, yet in matters of the heart,he hesitates.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s mild exasperation carried clearly through the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood answered with a smile, his eyes glinting with calculation, &#34;If Molly heard your words, she would be overjoyed. In the end, though, we can only guide-the choice is theirs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief silence, he added casually, &#34;Truth be told,I hope we can settle their marriage this very year.Molly has set her heart on Luis; her dreams revolve around him. A firm decision now would bring them peace-and us as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph chuckled with easy broad-mindedness.&#34;Sherwood, I meant it when I said I like Molly. But Luis &#39;thoughts are his own, and I cannot decide in his stead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, measuring his words. &#34;How about this: you speak with Luis yourself. If you reach an understanding,  I will not object.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s smile deepened,satisfaction flickering in his eyes. &#34;Very well, Joseph. Since you put it that way,I&#39;ll find time to speak with him directly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They lingered in pleasantries a while longer before ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood leaned back on the couch, a knowing smile tugging at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If this marriage could be sealed, then whatever Verena did would pale into insignificance. With Luis being the Sampson family&#39;s heir, there would be no place for one who had already married elsewhere to meddle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weekend dawned bright over Ochrerayd, the sky painted in a flawless blue while a gentle breeze carried refreshing coolness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the eastern suburbs, a renowned golf course stretched wide, its grass clipped to perfection like a vast emerald carpet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood arrived in a white tracksuit, his slightly rounded belly hinting at comfort more than discipline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A matching baseball cap crowned his head. Spotting Luis, he broke into a broad smile, raising his hand in  eager welcome. &#34;Luis, at last!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis, hearing his name, strode steadily forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore a fitted black tracksuit that emphasized his athletic frame, broad shoulders tapering to a firm waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A black cap sat low, shadowing his sharp, deep eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>WVith suspicions of Sherwood&#39;s intentions in his mind,Luis&#39; gaze now carried both scrutiny and restraint,though he cloaked it beneath composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he reached him, a glint of sharpness flickered and vanished in Luis&#39; eyes. Pressing his lips together, he greeted with steady courtesy, &#34;Mr. Kirk, forgive the delay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was deep, touched with due respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood stepped forward, patting his shoulder with a show of warmth. &#34;Luis, it&#39;s been far too long since our last game. My hands are itching for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a hearty laugh that rang across the open field. &#34;Today we must play to our heart&#39;s content.Don&#39;t hold back-show me just how much you&#39;ve improved.&#34;</p>
