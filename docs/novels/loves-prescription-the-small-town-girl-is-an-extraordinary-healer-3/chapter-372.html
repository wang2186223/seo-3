                <p>City lights slipped past as a sleek black vehicle drifted along the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside,Sherwood shared the back seat with a man who could have passed as his double. Both wore matching tailored suits,every detail of their hair and posture meticulously mirrored. At a glance, they might have been brothers, or even twins, so closely did they resemble each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deandre, stay sharp and keep your eyes open. We don&#39;t have room for even the smallest mistake,&#34;Sherwood said to the driver in a low voice as he glanced out the car window, scanning the streets for anything that looked out of place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since things went south with Verena and the others,he felt their eyes on him at every turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single mistake could ruin everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fingers tight on the wheel,Deandre Burton nodded without glancing back. &#34;You can count on me,Mr.Kirk.All precautions are in place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smooth as silk, the vehicle glided through busy  streets and pulled up in front of a club that glimmered beneath neon lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clusters of people lingered near the entrance, making it easy for someone to slip in unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is where you get out,&#34; Sherwood murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obeying with practiced calm, the man beside him nodded,drew a long breath, and swung the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every step he took mirrored Sherwood&#39;s usual bearing with flawless precision. A black hat tilted just enough to shadow his face, helping mask his features. The patterned black suit he wore shifted with the breeze as he stepped out of the car, its hem swaying gently.Around his neck hung a pendant etched with a detailed design, matching Sherwood&#39;s down to the last line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once outside, he paused to adjust his jacket, scanned the crowded sidewalk, and strode through the commotion toward the club, merging into the press of strangers as if he belonged there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vehicle rolled forward once more,weaving through side streets and winding turns before finally heading toward a nearby parking area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre maneuvered the car into a secluded space.hidden away from prying eyes. He turned and spoke quietly. &#34;We&#39;re here, Mr. Kirk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving with purpose, Sherwood slipped out of the car,keeping his head low as he ducked beneath the gaze of the security cameras. He made for a narrow exit at the lot&#39;s far edge, barely making a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, in the shadows, an old van waited for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood tugged open the van door and slipped inside,letting it click shut behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dust and the scent of old upholstery filled the cramped space. Dim light barely crept through the narrow windows, painting shifting patches on the threadbare seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With barely a glance at the driver, he kept his voice low. &#34;Head for the club outside the city.You know the one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wasting any time, the driver nodded and brought the van rumbling to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rough roads led them out past the city&#39;s edge, where the van rolled to a halt in front of a nondescript building half-lost in shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Streetlights offered little more than a dull haze,making the club blend right into the sleepy outskirts. Rather than attract attention by going through the front, Sherwood slid out, eyes sharp as he scanned the empty sidewalks. Without missing a beat, he skirted the busy entrance and made for the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thickset guard waited by the rear door, eyeing Sherwood up and down. After a brief pause, he opened the door in silence, letting Sherwood slip inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Low-lit hallways stretched before him,walls muffling the sounds of distant music. Sherwood moved quietly,pausing only when he reached a closed door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A light tap brought a voice from within. &#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in a slow breath, Sherwood opened the door and stepped into the suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Golden lamplight glowed against red velvet couches and dark carpets, giving the space an air of hushed decadence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, sprawled across a sofa, Daren puffed on a cigar, gray smoke curling through the air above him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About time you showed up, Mr. Kirk,&#34; said Daren,his grin crooked and his teeth yellowed by years of tobacco. He pushed himself upright, greeting Sherwood with a handshake that was strong but far from friendly Gaudy rings sparkled on Daren&#39;s fingers. His shirt,open almost to his navel, showed off a thatch of chest hair and a bit too much bravado.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s smile was thin, polite, but empty. He shook Daren&#39;s hand and said, &#34;Didn&#39;t mean to keep you waiting,Daren.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their grip was firm, but their eyes told a different story, each man sizing the other up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re always a gentleman. Take a load off,have a drink,&#34; said Daren, grabbing the whiskey bottle and pouring a generous measure into a glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood accepted the offer, sampling the whiskey as his gaze drifted around the shadowed room. &#34;You really know how to pick a place, Daren. Not exactly easy to stumble into.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daren let out a rough laugh, dropping onto the sofa and stretching out his legs. &#34;In our line of work,discretion is key.I figured you&#39;d appreciate the privacy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely,&#34; said Sherwood,nodding. &#34;You don&#39;t last long in this business if you&#39;re careless about where you meet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daren&#39;s smile stretched wider. &#34;I know you&#39;re not here for small talk, so let&#39;s not waste time. Why don&#39;t you see for yourself what I&#39;ve brought?&#34; Snapping his fingers twice, Daren signaled toward a side door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two hulking men entered carrying a stack of heavy boxes, setting them down in front of Sherwood with careful precision before flipping the lids open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaving his whiskey on the table,Sherwood rose and moved to inspect the merchandise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crouched down, scanning the contents with an expert&#39;s eye, every move careful and deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small sample caught his attention. He pinched it between his fingers and lifted it for a discreet sniff,picking up the scent with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, he grabbed a portable tester from the table and checked the goods thoroughly, his face giving away nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally stood up, a flicker of approval crossed his lips. &#34;Impressive work. The quality&#39;s top-notch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daren&#39;s cheeks rounded as he grinned, barely containing his pride. &#34;Only the best for you, Mr. Kirk.This batch has been moving fast, so l made sure to reserve the best for tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dramatic puff,Daren released a cloud of smoke, and then pointed at a few more boxes. &#34;If you like what you see, I&#39;ve got a few premium pieces in those as well. You might find them even more interesting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s brow tightened just a little as a flicker of doubt crept into his eyes, subtle but unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made his way to the stack of boxes, crouched beside them, and slipped his hand deep into one of the containers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers swept over the goods, testing for texture and weight, while a spark of interest flashed in his gaze. &#34;This isn&#39;t easy to find. Must&#39;ve cost you some trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapping the ash from his cigar, Daren&#39;s eyes narrowed with a calculating glint. &#34;It wasn&#39;t easy, that&#39;s for sure.But for you, Mr. Kirk, we&#39;ll make it happen. As long as you&#39;re happy, the effort&#39;s worth it.&#34;</p>
