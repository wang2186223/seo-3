                <p>Laura let out a quick explanation, her voice sharp with irritation. &#34;I tried calling Verena again, and she hung up on me. That ungrateful girl refuses to let go of her grudge. I&#39;ve already dialed her number more than twenty times, yet she still won&#39;t answer. I don&#39;t think I can bring myself to keep trying anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Kaia could get a word in, Laura grabbed her hand with a smile and added, &#34;But you&#39;re not like me.You&#39;re her little sister, and you&#39;ve never given her a reason to be upset. Verena won&#39;t turn against you.Besides, you&#39;ve always been clever with words and know how to win people over. So why don&#39;t you call her? Use a softer tone, say something nice, and ask her to talk Isaac into sparing us. After all, the two families will soon be tied together by marriage, so shouldn&#39;t we leave some space to work things out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stress of the situation had already stolen Laura&#39;s  sleep for several nights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught up in her own plotting, she didn&#39;t even notice the dark look tightening Kaia&#39;s features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia cut her eyes toward Laura, her jaw rigid with frustration. Just hearing Verena&#39;s name was enough to make her want to crush her, let alone lower herself to beg for Verena&#39;s mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes burned with a bloodshot glare, and the fury rising inside her roared to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snatching her hand free of Laura&#39;s hold, she burst out in a trembling voice, &#34;Verena, Verena, Verena!What makes her so special that everyone keeps talking about her? The others are obsessed, Dad is too, and now even you! Ever since she showed up, all of you only see her. Do I even count as your daughter anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living room went still for several seconds,her voice echoing off the wide walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words quivered, her tone almost breaking apart.  Laura froze, startled by the sudden fury, her smile stiff and unnatural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia had always been spoiled, but she had also been mild and obedient since she was young. Laura had never once seen her younger daughter rage with such raw anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s face filled with shock as she asked, &#34;Kaia,what has gotten into you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia balled her fists, drew in a sharp breath,and spoke through clenched teeth. &#34;I don&#39;t want to hear Verena&#39;s name again. Stop mentioningher in front of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed past Laura without another glance and stormed upstairs to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura stood frozen in place, truly stunned by Kaia&#39;s outburst, her eyes fixed blankly ahead as she struggled to recover. Something about her younger daughter felt changed, though she couldn&#39;t pinpoint what it was. All she knew was that Kaia no longer seemed like the girl she used to be. ···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater came back home from the bar that night and made his way directly toward Barrie&#39;s quarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was eager to share with Barrie everything that had unfolded earlier in the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flickered across Slater&#39;s face when he saw the back garden still lit up, since Barrie was usually in bed by this hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he drew closer, Slater spotted Barrie seated at the patio table, joined by Fletcher and Marietta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a seat beside them with a confused look, he asked, &#34;Dad, Mom, why are you still awake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You rascal, finally back from your outings.&#34;Marietta&#39;s tone carried mock annoyance, yet her eyes brimmed with affection. As she reached out to smooth down Slater&#39;s untidy bangs, she explained,&#34;We were having a discussion with your grandpa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Barrie kept to himself most of the time,Fletcher and Marietta often turned to him for advice  whenever company matters grew complicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I get it.&#34; Slater showed little interest in the details of their talk, but he straightened his posture and said firmly, &#34;It&#39;s good you&#39;re all here together.I have something very important to tell you.&#34;</p>
