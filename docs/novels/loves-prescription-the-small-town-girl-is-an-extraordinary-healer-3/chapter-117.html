                <p>Fortunately, Verena&#39;s mind stayed clear, like a candle that refuses to flicker in the wind, able to tell what mattered and what did not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her teeth, summoned her strength,and pushed Isaac away once more. Afraid he might try again, she quickly blurted, &#34;Isaac, listen to me.I need to examine your body.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, dismissive and suspicious, believed she was merely looking for an excuse to spurn his closeness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breathing heavily, his voice carried a note of displeasure. &#34;Is this really the moment for a checkup?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as he spoke, he leaned forward again, eager to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, quick on her feet, covered his mouth and sighed, &#34;Don&#39;t you see? Your body is responding.&#34; Isaac froze, caught off guard. His thoughts stalled,and he looked at her in bafflement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing that pause, Verena slipped from his grip,rose from his lap, and crouched beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting his shirt, she revealed his lean abdomen and pressed her fingertips against a few pressure points.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her hands moved, her eyes shifted toward his crotch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, the swelling that had been there subsided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena didn&#39;t feel let down; instead, her lips curled into a bright grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though brief, that flicker of change was like a light at the end of a long tunnel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up at Isaac with joy, she declared, &#34;This is wonderful! It proves my revised treatment plan is working. It&#39;s a good sign. Stay here a moment-I&#39;ll fetch the medicine and apply it again.&#34; With that, Verena dashed upstairs, her steps almost dancing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac sat there, dazed, watching her cheerful figure vanish from sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his gaze, staring at his abdomen, eyes filled with confusion and disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he really responded?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it not a trick of his imagination?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could there truly be hope of recovery-of becoming whole again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since that small but telling reaction, Verena devoted herself even more to refining her formulas, working tirelessly to craft a stronger ointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had even arranged a medical room for her within their home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day, as usual, Verena locked herself inside,weighing herbs, mixing medicines, and poring over her notes when Rhonda knocked, announcing that Danica had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena froze for a heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s mother?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had crossed paths only occasionally, and always with others around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time they met alone, the subject had been Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was Danica here now, and by herself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s brows knitted with faint doubt, and she told Rhonda, &#34;I understand. I&#39;ll come down shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the maid left, Verena went to the bedroom,slipped out of her loungewear, changed into something more formal, and descended the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Danica saw her, she quickly put down her coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a warm smile, she beckoned, saying, &#34;Verena,come over here!&#34; Verena was slightly taken aback by the familiar tone,yet her face betrayed nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling politely, she approached and greeted, &#34;Good day,Danica.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s smile deepened, fine lines showing at the corners of her eyes. &#34;Good day,my dear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drew Verena down beside her on the sofa,and then reached into her handbag and produced a red velvet box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, I want you to keep this.&#34; Danica opened it,revealing a jade bracelet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica gently slipped it onto Verena&#39;s wrist as she explained, &#34;This piece has been passed down through three generations. Take it as a blessing from me, as your mother-in-law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gazed at the lustrous jade. Though she knew little about jewelry, the quality spoke for itself-it was no ordinary piece. Understanding the meaning behind the gesture,she did not refuse. With a warm smile, she said, &#34;Thank you,Danica.It&#39;s truly beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, recalling something, she added, &#34;By the way,Isaac isn&#39;t home. Shall I call him back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her poised and graceful manner, Danica felt a quiet relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head and smiled faintly. &#34;No need.I came especially for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena maintained her composure, her tone gentle.&#34;Is there anything you want to discuss with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica cleared her throat, her gaze carrying a touch of apology. &#34;Verena, I wronged you before.When we first met, you mentioned graduating from Pine Hill University.I assumed you were lying and, if it weren&#39;t for the challenges lsaac and the Bennett family were facing, I&#39;d have opposed the marriage. Only now do l realize I misjudged you. I owe you an apology.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena blinked in mild surprise, and then smiled softly. &#34;Danica, there&#39;s no need. My mother&#39;s words created that misunderstanding. Before the truth surfaced, you were only looking out for lsaac. As a mother,you acted out of duty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were frank yet generous, the kind of response not everyone could manage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s fondness for her grew deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she learned Verena had cured Barrie&#39;s leg, she had been stunned. Once the truth was confirmed,shame replaced her prejudice, and gratitude filled her heart that Isaac had married Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only Verena could restore Isaac as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica placed her hand gently over Verena&#39;s.&#34;Verena, I know you healed Barrie. You&#39;re truly remarkable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice trembled, emotion catching in her throat.&#34;All I ask is that you try to heal lsaac&#39;s legs. You can&#39;t imagine how much he has endured. When the accident happened, his father died beside him. He spent a month in a hospital bed, and when he finally awoke, he had lost both his father and the use of his legs. From that moment, he changed-withdrawn,silent, shutting himself in his room day after day. And I, in my grief, selfishly blamed him for his father&#39;s death. The weight he carried was unbearable. But since you came into his life, he&#39;s softened. He no longer hides away; his gaze has light again. He&#39;s becoming more like the boy he once was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By then, tears streamed freely down Danica&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words painted a picture of lsaac&#39;s suffering during the months Verena had not been by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sorrow welled in Verena&#39;s eyes. She clasped Danica&#39;s hand and said earnestly, &#34;Isaac is my husband. Even without your request, I would give my all to heal him. Don&#39;t burden yourself with guilt. Every heart falters under grief. It is only human to break.I believe Isaac will understand you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica wept until her nose flushed red. Through her tears, she asked in disbelief, &#34;Truly? He won&#39;t hold it against me?&#34; Sensing her low spirits, Verena shifted the topic gently. &#34;Danica, I have good news. Isaac&#39;s sex function has already shown signs of progress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though embarrassed to discuss such matters with her mother-in-law, she chose honesty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From the beginning, I realized his problem wasn&#39;t just physical but deeply psychological. In the following treatments, I incorporated certain stimulating medicines.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers brushed her cheek, and her voice dropped slightly. &#34;Yesterday, when we were close, l noticed a reaction. It was fleeting, but it proves the treatment is working.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her words faded, silence lingered in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Danica gripped Verena&#39;s shoulders,eyes alight. &#34;Really? Verena, is that true? Has Isaac truly improved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her excitement tumbled out in repeated questions,while Verena smiled and nodded. &#34;Absolutely. I wouldn&#39;t deceive you about something so important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s joy overflowed. When she first arrived, she carried only the faintest glimmer of hope, knowing countless renowned doctors had declared Isaac&#39;s chances slim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now, Verena had given her a gift more precious than anything she could have dreamed.</p>
