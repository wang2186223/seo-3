                <p>Astrid&#39;s fingertips brushed lightly against Simon&#39;s jaw, and for a fleeting second, he froze as though turned to stone. Then, as if jolted by an unseen current, he shoved her away in haste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The force he used was too much-Astrid staggered back, nearly losing her footing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Simon realize his reaction had been far too severe. His head dipped, his deep voice carrying a shade of remorse. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Ms. Mills. I lost my composure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Astrid studied him with a discerning eye, and then shook her head slowly. &#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; she said, her tone even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the hospital, Astrid descended into the underground parking lot and dialed Verena&#39;s number. When the call connected, she spoke with deliberate calm, her tone brimming with confidence. &#34;Evelyn,from my experience and professional eye, I can say with certainty-Simon has undergone plastic surgery.The lines of his face, the symmetry of his features,they bear the marks of alteration that can&#39;t deceive my eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes lit with sudden clarity. Her vague suspicions had just been confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she could be nearly certain of one thing: Simon was Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena steadied her racing thoughts, answering firmly, &#34;Thank you, Astrid. I&#39;ve already transferred the payment to your account. Please check.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Astrid smiled. &#34;If you need my help again, don&#39;t hesitate to call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few pleasantries passed between them, and then the line went dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lowered the phone, moving toward the floor- to-ceiling window of her office. Arms folded, brows drawn, she gazed into the city&#39;s distant haze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recalled Isaac&#39;s earlier warning-that Luis and Simon might share some hidden bargain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis now had his sights set on Bennett Group,and his hand was clearly joined with Simon&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why would a man of Luis&#39; stature stoop to help Simon?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless... Simon possessed something against him.Or Luis carried a weakness Simon had seized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would explain why Luis, proud as he was, found himself·bound to Simon&#39;s cause against Bennett Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes narrowed. The knot to this puzzle seemed tied to Luis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, she turned back to her desk, lifted her phone, and began to type a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Luis had just stepped out of a meeting. Glancing at his phone, he noticed a message from an unfamiliar number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to dismiss it outright when the opening line caught his eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened it and read the simple text. &#34;Mr.Sampson, this is Verena. If convenient, let&#39;s meet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brow arched in surprise. Verena, taking the initiative? That was a twvist he hadn&#39;t expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the surprise didn&#39;t last long. A faint smile curved his lips. With long fingers, he typed a single word.&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their meeting was set at an upscale coffee shop in the heart of the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, warm light spilled softly, mingling with the faint aroma of roasted coffee and refined dishes,wrapping the place in an inviting charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena sat by the window, her expression taut with seriousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opposite her, a tall man lounged with practiced grace, legs crossed, his sharp gaze trained directly on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; lips lifted into a faint, teasing smile. &#34;Mrs.Bennett, after the incident at the hospital, I thought you&#39;d want nothing more than to keep your distance.Who would&#39;ve guessed you&#39;d inyite me yourself?Truly, an unexpected pleasure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he adjusted his collar and dipped his head lightly. &#34;I still owe you an apology for what happened that day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s brows knitted slightly. His polished manner struck her as nothing short of an act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she wasn&#39;t about to be charmed. Straightening,she spoke with cool firmness. &#34;Mr. Sampson, you&#39;re no fool. You must know I didn&#39;t come here for apologies or pleasantries. Let&#39;s not dance around it.Tell me-what deal do you have with Simon?&#34; Her eyes locked on his, sharp as a blade. &#34;Did he promise you benefits, or is he holding something over you that forced you into recklessly opposing the Bennett family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis faltered for the briefest second. His smile lingered, but his eyes betrayed a flicker of unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned back, folding his arms across his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was circling dangerously close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his mind raced, outwardly he remained composed. &#34;Are you investigating me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her slender fingers drummed lightly against the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her chin, a faint laugh slipping out. &#34;Isn&#39;t it only natural? To know both your own strength and your enemy&#39;s weakness-that is the surest way to win. Or tell me, Mr. Sampson, haven&#39;t you done the same while opposing my husband?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis only shrugged, offering neither denial nor admission. Verena pressed on. &#34;You&#39;re a businessman.Businessmen never strike without profit, nor do they stir trouble with the powerful without cause. You have no reason to pit yourself against my husband-unless someone asked you to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She folded her arms, her gaze unwavering. &#34;You met Simon almost immediately upon returning to Akoitha.Only after that did you move against us. That alone tells me Simon, not Isaac, is your true concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; brow twitched as he lifted the coffee before him,taking a deliberate sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inwardly, he sighed. She had piecedit all together with uncanny speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on,&#34; he said quietly, lips curling faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, her expression calm yet edged with steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The first day you came to my hospital, you stirred up trouble, pretending to harass me. But the moment Simon showed up, your act vanished. A man like you has no shortage of female company. Clearly, your performance was nothing but a test of Simon&#39;s :reaction to me. Let me hazard a guess at your motives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned her temple against her fingertip, her tone measured. &#34;First, Simon must hold something over you. Otherwise,with your influence, he couldn&#39;t dare corner you. Later, you had someone investigate him,discovered he was working at my hospital, and chose to exploit his Achilles&#39; heel. That day, you saw Simon&#39;s concern for me-and so you ceased your antics and left. Surveillance showed he left soon after. 1 suspect the two of you struck some kind of deal then, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes shone clear and steady, pinning him in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; expression shifted, surprise mingling with a grudging respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman before him-though outwardly uninvolved-saw through every layer of his plans.Remarkable. He had believed himself the one pulling strings,every move hidden. Yet she had unmasked the play with a single sweep of reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His so-called skirmishes with Isaac had been nothing but smoke. Simon was the true target, and Verena had unmasked it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis lowered his gaze, silently admiring her keen mind. Admiration, and something more, welled inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, he thought, was fortunate indeed to have such a wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking back at her, his eyes glimmered with interest. &#34;Impressive. Tell me-since you&#39;ve unraveled so much, what&#39;s your purpose in calling this meeting? Surely not just to flaunt your wit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not.&#34; Her voice was cool, he lips set in a faint smile. &#34;I want to know what kind of deal you struck with Simon, Mr. Sampson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; eyes sharpened, but Verena pressed on, her tone unwavering. &#34;You&#39;re a clever man. You should weigh which partnership profits you more. If you tell me the truth of your arrangement with Simon,perhaps Isaac and I can work with you. Together, we can let Simon see precisely what he expects to see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words struck Luis like ripples across still water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned slightly, an inner struggle flaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sister was the one treasure he could never forsake. He would move heaven and earth to find her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Simon, that cunning wretch, kept her whereabouts locked tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should he, then, consider cooperation with Isaac?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; hand clenched around his cup, knuckles whitening with pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One reckless move could doom his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt ensnared in a vast, invisible net: the harder he fought, the tighter it bound him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon was sly,Isaac formidable. But to remain passive before Simon was to walk into his trap. Perhaps it was better to seize the reins himself-and gamble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps... perhaps cooperating with lsaac and Verena could be his way out.</p>
