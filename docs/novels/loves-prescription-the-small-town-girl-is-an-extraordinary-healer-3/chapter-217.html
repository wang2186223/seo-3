                <p>A ripple of secret satisfaction stirred in Isaac&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough-wearing the mask of misery before Verena only pulled her closer, as though pity itself were a rope he could tug at will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe Simon wasn&#39;t entirely useless after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man had even claimed he wanted to move into lsaac&#39;s house to build trust and make communication easier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac scoffed. A man knows another man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, the truth was as plain as day-Simon&#39;s intention wasn&#39;t about the therapy; he was after Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Isaac&#39;s thoughts churned like restless waves, a shadow flickered by the window&#39;s edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the frame alone, he knew exactly who it was. And in that instant, certainty slammed into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze turned razor-sharp; with a sudden narrowing of his eyes, he seized Verena and pulled her straight into his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped, startled-only then realizing she had already been swept into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked, confusion clouding her. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac tilted her chin with two fingers, forcing her gaze to lock with his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat blazed in his eyes, his voice low and magnetic.&#34;Kiss me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The command carried steel, but beneath it lingered the spoiled edge of pleading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s self-control teetered. She tapped his shoulder. &#34;We&#39;re in a hospital.&#34; &#34;No one&#39;s watching.&#34; Isaac&#39;s glance slid deliberately toward the window, his lips curving into a sly smile.&#34;And you&#39;re my wife. So what&#39;s one kiss? Come on, what&#39;s the harm? Are you kissing me or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His last words rolled out low and velvety, brushing against her ear like a whisper that both teased and tempted, leaving her nerves tingling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes swept over him, her pulse stumbling faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely a fist of space lay between their chests, each breath snaring the other&#39;s until it seemed they breathed as one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s brows cut sharp lines, his eyes dark yet gleaming with a dangerous light. And those lips were full,curved, and waiting with unspoken temptation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jawline was cleanly carved, rugged yet devastatingly handsome. His hair fell just tousled enough to add a reckless edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From head to toe, he was impossible to resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, Verena couldn&#39;t deny it-her taste in men was flawless. In the end, her fragile self-control snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,just once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena shut her eyes and brushed her lips against his, already starting to pull away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Isaac&#39;s hand clamped firmly at the back of her head, dragging her closer as his mouth crashed down,deepening the kiss without mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, stifled groan escaped from Verena&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s scent, his heat-every inch of him consumed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes half-open, Isaac flicked a cold glance toward the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shadow flinched, and then vanished in a hurry. Isaac&#39;s lips curled with a mocking smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Verena had ever managed to make him feel small. But in front of others, he was confident of himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Water thundered from the hospital sink, splattering against porcelain in an endless rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon bent low, scooping a handful to his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The icy spray stung his skin, but it could not quench the inferno clawing inside his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy raged, wild and merciless, a fire that refused to burn out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands clamped onto the sink, muscles taut, eyes drilling into the reflection staring back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why Isaac? Why in God&#39;s name him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even crippled, the man still commanded Verena&#39;s devotion. Isaac was already showered with blessings,and he still held the one thing Simon craved beyond reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Longing soured into bitterness, and bitterness fermented into hate. He could not comprehend it A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Verena had saved them both. So why did she choose lsaac?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because the Bennett family name weighed heavier on the scales?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fate had turned cruel, merciless-a cosmic joke. Simon wanted nothing more than Verena, yet still had to wrestle for her like a beggar at the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mirror mocked him as his own lips twisted into a crooked grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw locked tight, eyes narrowing with ruthless resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His course was set. By hook or by crook, he would claim Verena. And Isaac... Simon&#39;s eyes glowed dark, venom dripping in the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Isaac had cheated death once, then death could still claim him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last time, his father had pulled him back from the abyss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, no such miracle would intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life rarely dealt the same hand twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Isaac&#39;s pride lay in his family name, Simon would shred that pride to pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could not topple Isaac on his own, but somewhere,someone could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s grip tightened until his knuckles blanched, veins standing out like cords of iron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac trusted his instincts-and his instincts whispered that Simon stank of hidden motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving for work, Verena quietly promised she would dig into Simon&#39;s past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac hungered for answers even more than she did. So he told her to leave it in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena offered no protest; she only nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she left, Isaac lifted his phone and called Jacob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jacob. Dig into someone for me. His name is Simon Moss. He&#39;s a shrink, new at Verena&#39;s hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,Mr.Bennett. I&#39;ll begin immediately.&#34; Jacob&#39;s voice cut through, sharp and precise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac ended the call, his fingers tapping thoughtfully against the phone&#39;s edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled Simon&#39;s stare-unsettling in its stillness, watchful as a hawk, calculating to the last detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon was no harmless shrink. And since Jacob&#39;s digging might not strike deep enough, Isaac didn&#39;t hesitate-he dialed another number.&#34;Stevie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac? Calling me out of nowhere? How are you feeling? Are you alright? Want me to come over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The questions poured out in a torrent, but lsaac sliced through them with a sharp interruption. &#34;No need. I&#39;m fine.K&lt;eep your focus on work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With clear reluctance, Stevie sank back into his chair, the motion heavy with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then tell me-how&#39;s recovery? Didn&#39;t Verena say rehab was beginning soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze drifted toward the window, his voice flat. &#34;I tried. Failed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; Stevie blurted. &#34;The surgery-did something go wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The surgery was fine. The problem&#39;s in my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Psychological?&#34; Stevie asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly.&#34; Isaac&#39;s voice dropped cold. &#34;I need a favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stevie froze, bewildered. &#34;Isaac, I&#39;m a hacker, not a shr nk. You&#39;ve got the wrong guy. Wrong number maybe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rare, dangerous smile tugged at Isaac&#39;s lips. &#34;I don&#39;t need therapy. I need you to dig into someone.&#34;</p>
