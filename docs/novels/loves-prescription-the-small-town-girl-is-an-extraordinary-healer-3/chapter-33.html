                <p>Compete With You</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby was about to speak when Slater came over and asked if he knew Dr. Willis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Willis?&#34; Bobby blinked in disbelief, his eyes flicking to Verena before he turned to Slater. &#34;Wait-are you saying she&#39;s the one who treated your grandfather?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater gave a firm nod. &#34;Yeah. That&#39;s her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby stared at Verena, stunned. &#34;You&#39;re not just gorgeous-you&#39;re talented too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the awe on Bobby&#39;s face, Slater asked curiously, &#34;Wait,do you actually know her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby swallowed hard and gave a quick nod. &#34;She&#39;s the doctor who pulled me through after my car accident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning closer,Bobby whispered with barely contained excitement, &#34;She&#39;s exactly the kind of woman I&#39;d want as my sister-in-law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater let out a short laugh. &#34;What are the odds of that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of a sudden, every argument they&#39;d had felt meaningless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching their exchange, Verena gave Bobby a warm smile. &#34;It was nothing, really. I&#39;m just glad to see you doing well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That easy smile left Bobby frozen in place.She really was everything he imagined-beautiful, graceful, and impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Slater caught Bobby grinning like a fool, he gave him a teasing shove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby snapped out of his daze, suddenly remembering something important. &#34;Oh, right, Dr.Willis.&#34; His voice grew urgent. &#34;If you were able to treat Slater&#39;s grandfather, then your skills must be remarkable. I need your help. My brother&#39;s legsare paralyzed... do you think there&#39;s any chance he can be treated?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby had been tempted to blurt out that she should be his sister-in-law, but he knew he&#39;d only get yelled at for that. Instead, he took the long way around,hoping lsaac would eventually see for himself how kind and extraordinary the doctor truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his desperation, Verena gave him a calm smile. &#34;It&#39;s hard to explain in words. Every case is different, and I can&#39;t say anything for sure until I see the patient myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By coincidence, she happened to be studying Isaac&#39;s condition at that very time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby&#39;s brow creased as he asked, &#34;Have you ever treated someone with leg paralysis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena answered calmly,&#34;I&#39;ve worked on two cases like that before. And I&#39;m currently treating a patient with leg paralysis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words rushed out. &#34;And did they recover?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave a small nod. &#34;It took years of treatment and steady recovery, but in the end, both of them walked again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her words sank in, Bobby lit up, all thoughts of his earlier schemes vanishing. &#34;Dr. Willis,please-you have to help my brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s voice stayed steady. &#34;I&#39;ll need to examine him first before I can say anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though surgery still weighed on her mind as a difficult barrier, she knew she had to keep pushing herself to face patients directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby held out his phone eagerly. &#34;Can I add you on the chat app? I promise I won&#39;t bother you with random messages.&#34; After a moment of thought, Verena nodded.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second she agreed, Bobby broke into a wide smnile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she added him, Verena slipped her phone back into her pocket. &#34;When you&#39;re home, ask your brother if he&#39;s willing to meet me. If he agrees,we can set up a time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby nodded over and over. &#34;Alright, alright-I&#39;ll talk to him for sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight press of her lips, Verena offered a calm smile and said, &#34;Well then, I suppose it&#39;s time for me to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Verena mentioned leaving, Bobby cheerfully waved her off and kept smiling until she disappeared through the front gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater, unable to watch any longer, shoved Bobby&#39;s hand down. &#34;Seriously? She&#39;s already gone, and you&#39;re still standing here grinning like an idiot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby folded his arms and lifted his chin with pride.&#34;What do you expect? She&#39;s smart,gorgeous, and the perfect sister-in-law. I could smile at her all day without getting tired of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater couldn&#39;t stand that smug expression on his face. He let out an exaggerated gasp. &#34;Oh, right-I never told you. My grandpa once said I should go after Dr.Willis myself. So what now? Should I compete with you to see if she&#39;d rather be my girlfriend or your sister-in-law?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby&#39;s temper flared. &#34;Dream on! She&#39;s already destined to be my sister-in-law. You don&#39;t get to challenge Isaac. And if you try... I&#39;ll-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He jabbed a finger at Slater, paused dramatically for a few seconds, and then blurted out his so-called threat. &#34;I&#39;ll cut you off as a friend!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once upon a time, Slater never would&#39;ve been able to measure up to Isaac. But now, with Isaac bound by his disability, things weren&#39;t the same anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After throwing out his so-called threat, Bobby didn&#39;t bother waiting for a reaction. He wasn&#39;t angry-just in a rush to get home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left standing in the chilly night, Slater shook his head as Bobby stormed off. &#34;Unbelievable. I was joking,and he&#39;s already acting like we&#39;re about to break up as friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back home, Bobby sprawled across his bed, his eyes fixed on the ceiling Phone in hand, his gaze stayed locked on the new contact he&#39;d just added-Dr. Willis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her profile picture was nothing but a white backdrop,simple yet giving off a calm, reserved vibe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Bobby was convinced she carried both wisdom and grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought in mind, Bobby tapped her profile,erased the name &#34;Dr. Willis,&#34; and proudly renamed it &#34;Perfect Sis-in-Law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He admired the change for a moment, and then went back to his homepage looking pleased with himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier that day,he had gotten Verena&#39;s number from Kaia and added her as a friend. Her profile now sat just beneath the one he labeled as Perfect Sis-in-Law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his eyes landed on the golden profile picture,Bobby let out a mocking sneer. &#34;So tacky. No sense of style at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened her chat and quickly sent a message,saying, &#34;Verena Willis,I want to meet. Tell me when you&#39;re free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether Verena was right for lsaac or not, her past lies about her education and her attempt to disfigure her sister had already filled him with disgust. Normally,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he wouldn&#39;t have bothered with someone like her. But since she was about to join their family, he had no choice but to meet her face-to-face. He was determined to uncover who she really was and how she managed to fool lsaac so completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat there with his phone in hand, eyes fixed on the screen as he waited for her reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, over at the Willis Villa, Kaia sat before her vanity, her makeup still perfect, yet her expression was clouded with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone could tell her mood had soured completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock came at the door, and Laura&#39;s voice followed.&#34;Kaia, who did you meet today? Tell me everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia bit her lip as she unclasped her necklace. &#34;Mom,not tonight. I&#39;m exhausted and just want to sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura longed to hear about her daughter&#39;s social wins,but after Kaia&#39;s response, she had no choice but to drop the subject.</p>
