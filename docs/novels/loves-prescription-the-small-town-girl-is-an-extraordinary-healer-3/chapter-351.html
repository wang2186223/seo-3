                <p>Only the desk lamp glowed in the bedroom, its lone light battling the vast sea of night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stepped from the bathroom, wrapped in an oversized nightgown that draped loosely across her figure. Her damp hair clung to her cheeks in wayward strands, setting off the delicate flush upon her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She eased down on the bed&#39;s edge, reached for the towel beside the pillow, and began to blot away the lingering traces of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Isaac concluded his talk with Jacob outside. Entering the room, he caught sight of Verena -quiet,poised,and radiant in her simplicity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile, tender and indulgent, rose unbidden as he rolled his chair forward and stopped before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his nearness, Verena lifted her gaze. Their eyes met, and she answered him with a soft smile of her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words seemed needless. Isaac reached for her hand,drawing her gently into his arms. Then,without pause,he took the towel from her grasp,beginning to dry her hair himself-stroke by stroke,careful as though he were handling spun silk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every motion bore patience, every touch a silent vow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena closed her eyes halfway, surrendering to the moment, her body light with the calm bliss of being cared for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bath&#39;s steam lingered, veiling them in a hushed warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now and again, his fingertips grazed her ear, igniting a red glow that deepened beneath his steady gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He faltered briefly, and then bent to place a delicate kiss on her earlobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, do you miss me?&#34; His voice, low and magnetic, carried a teasing lilt, each syllable stirring her heart like strings plucked to a secret tune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes opened, and in one fluid movement she circled her arms around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her head, she pressed her lips to his. &#34;Yes,&#34;she breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kiss grew deeper, their breath tangled, urgent, as though time itself hastened around them. Finding the angle awkward, Verena shifted to rise, and Isaac, attuned to her every cue, followed her onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bent closer, and her hand instinctively shielded her rounded belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For an instant she recoiled, yet his roughened palm steadied her lower back, cradling rather than restraining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the table, a glass trinket caught their entwined shapes, merging shadow and silhouette into one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac, you&#39;re hurting the baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath scorched her skin, but his words carried a paradox-warmth threaded with ice. &#34;No, never. I could not bear to harm either of my treasures.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faint rustle of his trousers brushed against her nightclothes, a whisper in the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena laughed softly, pushing at his chest, only for him to capture her wrist and press it gently against the pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingertips traced her ribs, and she shivered,her cheeks flaring with a tempting blush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do my parents know you came suddenly?&#34; The question spilled out, cut by her gasp as she turned her face away from his mischievous lips. But lsaac only nuzzled her ear, relentless in his teasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His laughter rumbled low, vibrating through his chest.&#34;They had already retired, so I left them undisturbed.But I did encounter Luis on the way up-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words never finished. Verena stiffened, fingers digging into the back of his neck with sudden force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midnight wrapped the villa in stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon the great bed, Verena and Isaac lay entwined in sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Verena suddenly frowned in slumber, her body curling,unease betraying itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One hand pressed against her belly; a soft groan escaped her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though faint, it rang like a bell in Isaac&#39;s ears, rousing him instantly from the edge of dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes snapped open, the haze vanishing,replaced by a blade-sharp alertness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat upright, bending toward her,his voice taut with alarm. &#34;Verena, what&#39;s wrong? Are you in pain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips pressed tight, sweat pearled at her forehead,  and her hand clutched her stomach with desperate force. Isaac&#39;s chest clenched painfully, as though an iron grip had seized his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a heartbeat, he flung off the covers, swung to his feet, and scooped her into his arms-swift yet painstakingly careful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lay limp, her brows knotted, her weak whimpers carving into him like knives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, the world held nothing but her and the fragile life within her womb. His steps quickened toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He forgot entirely that he usually relied on a wheelchair for quick movements. Now, his legs carried him without falter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the corridor he strode, the moonlight stretching and shrinking his silhouette as though testing his resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arms strained, sweat dotting his brow in rhythm with hers-whether from fear or effort, he did not know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when the cold wind of the villa&#39;s entrance struck his face did he realize-he had walked the length unaided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But miracle or not, he gave it no thought. His world  was Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calling for the chauffeur, his gaze never left her pale face,his voice trembling on the edge of command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chauffeur hurried forth, but froze at the sight-Isaac, who had been bound to a chair, now stood tall,Verena in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock widened his eyes. The words stumbled out,broken. &#34;M-Mr. Bennett... you... you can stand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the urgency of the moment crushed his astonishment. His gaze darted to Verena, panic overtaking disbelief. &#34;What happened to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had no time to explain. His brow furrowed,voice cutting sharp as a blade. &#34;Don&#39;t just gape! Drive us to the hospital-now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed forward into the garage, his steps swift yet measured, shielding her against every jolt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chauffeur, startled into action, leapt into the car,fumbling the keys until the engine roared alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tires shrieked as the vehicle tore into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through it all, lsaac held Verena close, his hand stroking her belly, his voice a steady murmur. &#34;Verena,don&#39;t be afraid. We&#39;re almost there. Just hold on.&#34; But his trembling fingers betrayed the fear he tried so hard to mask.</p>
