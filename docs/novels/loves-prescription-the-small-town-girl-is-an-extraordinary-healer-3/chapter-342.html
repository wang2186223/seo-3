                <p>Twenty minutes later, Luis arrived at the Serenity Hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist at the front desk was quick as a hawk,spotting him the instant he entered the lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a bright smile, she glided forward, bowing slightly.Offering him a room card with both hands, she said with crisp politeness, &#34;Mr. Sampson, Miss Brown is waiting for you upstairs. The elevator is on the left;just swipe the card to reach the floor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gestured gracefully toward the elevator as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis acknowledged her with a small nod, accepted the card, and moved toward the lift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, he reached the right floor,swiped the card, and opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the faint fragrance of jasmine lingered in the air.Soft light poured through sheer curtains, scattering patterns across the polished floor like fragments of silk. Miranda sat with her back to him, a picture of unhurried elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the door open, she turned slightly,a knowing smile curving her lips as she raised her glass. &#34;Mr.Sampson, you finally made it. Do make yourself at home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis stepped in, pausing as he came near her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She probably had not planned to step outside that day,as she wore a light-purple loungewear set. Loose and flowing, it draped around her like a casual robe, yet still hinted at grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without the embellishment of her usual polished makeup, she looked strikingly natural-her skin smooth,her beauty untempered. Her eyes glimmered with vitality, enough to make Luis&#39; gaze hold for a moment too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wine glass tilted slightly as Miranda glanced up,noticing his silence. A spark of surprise lit her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her first time seeing Luis in sportswear. Devoid of his formal armor, he looked younger,almost like a college boy caught out of class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze lingered, finding the contrast fascinating.The stern, calculating man of business now bore a fresh aura, a paradoxical charm that tugged at her  thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind drifted briefly toward unspoken images, but she quickly anchored herself-she couldn&#39;t let the reins slip too soon, not after last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she steadied her tone, pointing playfully to the seat beside her. &#34;Mr. Sampson, don&#39;t stand like a statue-sit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis realized his eyes had lingered longer than courtesy allowed. He drew them back,lowered his gaze, and sat beside her with quiet composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that angle, her profile came into view, softened by the light, and it struck him with sudden force-delicate yet dazzling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned away almost immediately, cleared his throat,and spoke evenly. &#34;Miss Brown, regarding the collaboration you proposed earlier-do you require my feedback now, or do you have something new to bring to the table?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s lips curved, her eyes crescented in mirth.&#34;Patience, Mr. Sampson. Good things don&#39;t ripen in haste. Let&#39;s not rush.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rose,her movements unhurried,and glided toward the wine cabinet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing a crystal-clear glass and a bottle of vintage wine,she returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing before him, she said with a smile, &#34;This was flown in from Clokron. A vintage of rare standing-rich, aromatic, and hard to come by here. I believe it will suit your taste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She poured it gently, the ruby liquid catching the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis inclined his head in acknowledgment,accepting the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their fingers brushed lightly-an unintended spark,fleeting yet potent-though his face betrayed no ripple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, inwardly, questions stirred. Was this meeting really about business?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swirled the glass slowly, studying the deep color,as though admiring it while quietly taming the restlessness within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At length, he remarked with a steady tone,&#34;Remarkable. Clearly, you&#39;ve chosen with care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a sip, the rich layers spreading across his tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda sat back down, instinctively leaning closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes, unshielded, roamed over him openly. Every  subtle gesture-from the tilt of his wrist to the press of the glass against his lips-seemed to hold her captive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile deepened; her eyes narrowed in delight.This was more than wine-it was theater, and he was the star. And dressed like a student, he struck exactly the note that stirred her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis felt the sofa shift as Miranda edged closer, the jasmine fragrance wrapping around him like a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he turned, her hair brushed against his sleeve,strands cascading like fine silk threads, adding weight to the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint dryness tightened his throat. He steadied himself, lifted his gaze, and met hers. &#34;Miss Brown,shall we speak of business now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His question only fed the playful spark in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning forward deliberately, she let her hair spill over her chest, her gaze soft yet unyielding as it locked on his cool stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting instant, memories of past closeness flickered in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pulse quickened as she recalled the warmth of his softened gaze in those intimate moments. She extended her hand,slender fingers trailing lightly across the back of his hand that held the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From his defined knuckles, she traced her way upward,slow and deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each touch was a spark, fanning a flame that threatened to leap higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Sampson,&#34; she murmured, her voice a silken lure,&#34;isn&#39;t rushing into business a tiresome pursuit?Sometimes, we should relax and enjoy the moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; exterior remained unruffled, his eyes calm as a lake at dawn, but inside the fire already blazed. His Adam&#39;s apple shifted involuntarily; his grip on the glass grew taut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her playful smile,hearing her lilting tone, he realized-yet again-that he had stepped willingly into Miranda&#39;s snare.</p>
