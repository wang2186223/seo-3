                <p>After leaving Ivan&#39;s place, Verena waited quietly at the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, a polished black car eased its way in her direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glow from the streetlights slid across its surface,casting a crisp, metallic shine over the sleek frame.Its refined shape hinted at quiet luxury, while the tinted glass shielded the interior from view, givingit an air of intrigue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the car came to a stop, the driver got out with practiced ease. He walked straight to the rear passenger side and opened the door with careful precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside sat Isaac, who was in his wheelchair. With the driver&#39;s steady support, Isaac made his way out of the vehicle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the soft glow of the streetlamp, Verena lifted her gaze to meet his. The wind caught her hair,sending a few wisps across her face, giving her an almost spellbinding grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft, yellow glow spilled through the street,casting everything in a hazy, welcoming warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While en route, Isaac&#39;s mind had raced with worries about what he might find.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, the second his gaze landed on Verena, his world seemed to quiet down. The pounding in his chest slowed, and the heavy thoughts that had followed him began to fade away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped for just a moment, and Verena rushed forward, wrapping her arms around him and burying her face in the curve of his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the moment, the driver quietly stepped away to give them privacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s embrace tightened, holding her as though he could never let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still wanting more closeness, he leaned into her,taking in the familiar scent of her skin as if it could ease every trace of worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the tension he still carried, Verena gently rubbed his neck with her forehead and spoke softly,her voice light and comforting. &#34;It&#39;s the small hours,yet you still came to pick me up? I feel so lucky.Thank you,sweetheart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached up to give him a pair of delicate kisses on his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac found it impossible to keep his guard up around her.His stern face relaxed into a gentle smile, though a faint crease lingered between his brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Locking eyes with Verena, his voice carried a firm edge. &#34;It&#39;s already late. Whatever business you have can wait.What matters now is rest, especially with a child on the way. You&#39;re not in the best health, and just yesterday you swore you&#39;d look after yourself.Yet here you are, running yourself ragged without  even planning to come home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry and tenderness colored his voice, though a faint trace of jealousy lingered beneath it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had already picked up on it during their call earlier, even if he never voiced it directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rubbed Isaac&#39;s back in a comforting rhythm and spoke with complete sincerity. &#34;Isaac, I went to see Ivan because he&#39;s the best when it comes to technology. I needed his help with something complicated, and it was taking longer than I thought.While I waited, I dozed off on the sofa,and that&#39;s why I forgot to call you first. I&#39;m sorry for putting you through that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wordsrang true, just as they always did, and that honesty left Isaac unwilling to question Ivan&#39;s current place in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt some of his anxiety begin to melt away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he still lowered his voice to remind her. &#34;Verena,you&#39;re my wife. Whenever you run into trouble, you  should come to me. I&#39;ve got plenty of people on staff who can handle anything you need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated for a second, sat up straighter, and met his eyes directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were many problems she could have turned over to lsaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for this one, her instincts told her lvan was the right person to trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered a gentle shake of her head. &#34;I really appreciate it, love, but this time it isn&#39;t necessary.Everything will be taken care of soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still seemed troubled, the crease between his brows refusing to leav/e,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena reached up and traced the lines away with her fingers, tilting her head with a reassuring smile.&#34;You don&#39;t need to worry, sweetheart. This was just a rare situation, and I swear I&#39;ll never come home this late again. I&#39;ll remember what you said and promise to look after myself.How does that sound?&#34; Seeing her playful attempt to put him at ease, lsaac&#39;s spirits lifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least he knew she was thinking of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brought her hand to his lips for a gentle kiss.&#34;Alright, but only this once. The wind&#39;s picking up.Let&#39;s headhome together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a lighthearted grin, Verena let go of him and helped guide the wheelchair backtoward the car.</p>
