                <p>Once dinner drew to an end, the Sampson family and their guests drifted into the living room, easing into the sofas as the atmosphere shifted to casual conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph angled himself slightly toward Sherwood,who sat across from himn. &#34;Sherwood, you&#39;ve been recuperating in the countryside this past year. How are you holding up now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood answered with his familiar, unhurried smile,dismissing the concern with a light wave. &#34;I&#39;m managing well enough, Joseph. There&#39;s no need for worry. But you and Marisa... the toll of searching for Verena shows on you both. You must remember to care for yourselves, too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A weary sigh escaped Joseph&#39;s lips, and he seemed ready to reply when a servant appeared, balancing several small parcels of medicine in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated nearby, Verena slipped a section of orange to Marisa before turning to her father. &#34;Dad, I&#39;ve prepared some herbal treatments for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for the medicine packages the maid</p>
                
                
                
                <p>anded her as she remarked, &#34;These herbs were hosen to match the condition you&#39;re dealing with ght now, and they should help bring your body back nto balance. I&#39;ll walk the servants through the nstructions more thoroughly later. Dad, you have to remember to take them on schedule. If you stick with it, your health will slowly begin to turn around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s gaze lingered on the medicine, and then rose to Verena&#39;s face. His eyes glistened, betraying the emotions he struggled to hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand closed over hers, trembling slightly. &#34;Verena...after all the years I failed to protect you, after all the ways I fell short, you still think of me. I don&#39;t deserve this kindness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s smile deepened as he nodded approvingly.&#34;Such devotion is rare. Joseph, you&#39;re blessed to have a daughter with a heart as thoughtful as hers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly leaned forward with a bright smile. &#34;Yes, Verena really is remarkable. So caring, so attentive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena returned the praise with a modest smile and a gentle nod. Before she could reply, Luis spoke up, his eyes steady on her. &#34;Verena, have you studied Mom&#39;s medical records I sent you? Has there been any progress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s expression tightened, his eyes fixed on Verena with equal parts worry and hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s brows drew together, her lips parting as if to respond, but Sherwood cut in with á tone that masked itself as concern. &#34;Luis, you need to be patient.Your mother&#39;s condition didn&#39;t come about in a day, so it&#39;s only natural that the cure won&#39;t appear right away either. Even so, Verena is a doctor, and there&#39;s no doubt about her skill or training.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Joseph, he added reassuringly,&#34;Have faith in her, Joseph. In time, she will find the way to heal Marisa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though disappointment flickered across Joseph&#39;s face,he forced himself to nod. He knew his anxiety made him restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena inclined her head slightly in acknowledgment before responding, &#34;Mr. Kirk is right. My mother&#39;s condition won&#39;t be resolved overnight, and pushing for quick results will only make things harder. But...&#34;Her pause carried weight, her lips curving faintly as confidence lit her gaze. &#34;I&#39;ve already discovered a treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words snapped the attention of the room onto her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s dim eyes came alive in an instant, trembling hands reaching forward as if to clutch the hope she  offered. &#34;Verena... you mean it? You&#39;ve really found a cure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; face broke into unguarded joy, pride and relief mingling in his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Molly froze with a cherry between her fingers, her surprise plain. Doubt lingered in her thoughts-wasn&#39;tMarisa&#39;scondition declaredhopeless?Could Verena trúly have such ability?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Isaac quietly tended to Verena&#39;s hands,dabbing them clean with a damp towel after she peeled the fruit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lashes cast shadows over his eyes,which remained lowered,calm and composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t need to be astonished; to him, Verena&#39;s brilliance had never been in question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Isaac&#39;s eyes, Verena had always been extraordinary,so her confidence came as no surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from her, Sherwood&#39;s composure faltered.His fingers, resting idly on the arm of the sofa, clenched hard enough to pale at the knuckles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief instant, his face betrayed him,panic and disbelief flashing through his gaze like a bolt of lightning. Every renowned physician who had once treated Marisa had declared her illness too difficult, too stubborn to heal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with Verena&#39;s reputation, he had assumed she would struggle for years before making progress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she had outstripped every expectation,proving herself far beyond what he had imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Sherwood masked the lapse, forcing out a hearty laugh that rang through the room.&#34;Remarkable! Verena truly lives up to her title as a miracle healer. To discover a solution so swiftly is nothing short of incredible. Joseph,you can finally breathe easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s lashes lowered as he shifted his gaze, the smallest flicker of cold insight passing throughhis eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph, on the other hand, nearly leapt from his seat with joy. &#34;Verena, when can you begin treating your mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena drew herself up, her expression steady,her tone unwavering. &#34;We can start right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Joseph was stunned. Then his entire face lit up, his head nodding over and over.&#34;Wonderful! Begin immediately. If it means her  recovery, we won&#39;t waste a second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, the others stepped back, creating a quiet circle of space for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the bundle on the table, Verena retrieved another set of herbs she had prepared in advance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She struck the flame to the herbs, the soft smoke spiraling upward as the faint, earthy scent spread through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She approached Marisa, her voice soft as she said,&#34;Mom, don&#39;t be nervous. This will ease your body and bring comfort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion lingered in Marisa&#39;s eyes as she watched,uncertain of the process. But her trust in her daughter kept her still, obediently yielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With calm precision, Verena located the exact acupoint. Her hand steady, she hovered the glowing herbs above the crown of Marisa&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle heat seeped into Marisa&#39;s body, softening the rigid tension etched across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting with care, Verena guided the herbs toward a different acupoint, one meant to calm the spirit and steady the mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her concentration never wavered, gauging the exact  distance of the glowing tip from her mother&#39;s skin,making certain the warmth soothed without ever burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,if it feels too hot or uncomfortable, let me know,&#34; Verena said softly. Marisa gave a faint nod,her eyes hazy,almost dreamlike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room had fallen into a hushed stillness, broken only by the faint crackle of the smoldering herbs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every gaze lingered on the pair at the center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph and Luis stayed focused on Verena and Marisa,their gazes steady as quiet prayers filled their thoughts. They wished with everything in them that the treatment would make a real difference and that Marisa&#39;s strength would return before long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly, at first intrigued by the ritual, soon grew restless as the minutes stretched on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her attention strayed, settling on Luis, and once there,it refused to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Admiration softened her eyes, a quiet affection spilling into her stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis, however, noticed nothing. His focus was entirely on his mother, his brows tight with worry, his posture firm and protective. The more Molly watched him, the deeper her feelings burrowed,a private longing stirring-one that dreamed of becoming his wife someday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the far edge of the group, Isaac sat angled back,his fingers pressed lightly against his lips as though deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From beneath lowered lashes, his eyes flickered toward Verena, though his true attention lingered on Sherwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood,who stood apart, had lost his warm smile.His narrowed gaze betrayed a storm of emotions, as though he were barely containing something dark and unsettled within.</p>
