                <p>Luis eased back into his seat, his eyes fixed on Verena with a kind of silent admiration that needed no explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something about the way she cut straight to the point. No games, no wasted time. That reminded him of himself and made him appreciate her even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A waiter approached, pausing beside their table with a respectful nod. &#34;What would you like to drink,sir?&#34;he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Luis looked up and answered, &#34;Americano. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned his attention back to Verena, his gaze sharp and assessing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I spent some time thinking about what you  proposed yesterday, and I won&#39;t lie, it does have its appeal,&#34; remarked Luis, his brows drawing in ever so slightly. &#34;Buut the truth is, Simon&#39;s holding the one thing he knows can hurt me. All I care about is making sure the person I&#39;m trying to find stays safe.So, if you expect me to go along with you, tell me this. What exactly can you do to guarantee that person&#39;s safety?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers drummed a slow rhythm on the tabletop as he added, &#34;And before you answer, just know Simon isn&#39;t the type to play by anyone else&#39;s rules.He acts on impulse and never considers the bigger picture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their conversation paused when the Americano arrived. After offering a quiet thank you, Luis picked up where he left off. &#34;If Simon even suspects I&#39;m not following his demands, he&#39;ll snap. He&#39;d hurt the person I care about without hesitation. She means everything to me. Even the tiniest risk. isn&#39;t acceptable. If you really want me to help you, I need complete assurance that you can outmaneuver Simon.Otherwise, I can&#39;t take the chance.&#34; Luis&#39; expression hardened as he thought about his sister, the person he cherished above all else. He couldn&#39;t allow even the smallest threat to touch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Verena listened, her gaze drifted to the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That person meant everything to him...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That realization hit her hard, and she took a moment to gather her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met his eyes and replied, her voice steady and clear, &#34;Mr. Sampson, since you&#39;re so observant, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already noticed Simon has feelings for me. The last time you stirred up trouble at my hospital, I could see you&#39;d figured out how much influence I have over him. You can be sure I&#39;m his weakness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis listened and found himself caught off guard by her response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, and then let a small smile flicker across his face before shaking his head. &#34;So you want to use yourself as leverage? That won&#39;t change  anything. I&#39;ve already tried to threaten him with your safety. Simon isn&#39;t just unstable. If he thinks I&#39;m winning, he&#39;d rather take you down with him than let me get what I want. The man doesn&#39;t care about consequences, and he&#39;s already shown he&#39;ll hurt anyone close to you if it suits his purpose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena met his gaze, calm and unflinching. &#34;You&#39;re right about Simon. He doesn&#39;t think like everyone else. Typical strategies won&#39;t reach him. That&#39;s why I&#39;m suggesting something different.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis looked puzzled, unsure of what she meant.Verena added, &#34;He feels something for me, and that gives us the perfect opening. I don&#39;t need you to pressure him or throw around threats. All I have to do is offer a little kindness, just enough to cloud his judgment. While he&#39;s still trying to figure out what&#39;s happening,I&#39;ll already have what I came for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words rang with assurance, each one steady and clear, as if she&#39;d already mapped out every possible outcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis laced his fingers together, studying Verena with  newfound respect. He had to admit, she was as sharp as she was poised. Her ability to pinpoint the weakness in any situation was remarkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, he found himself admiring her more than he&#39;d expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling himself back to the conversation, he asked,&#34;So you&#39;re planning to use yourself as bait to distract Simon? That way, you keep the person I&#39;m trying to protect out of harm&#39;s way, and then we team up to handle him. Is that your plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena reached for her glass, took a slow sip, and set it back on the table. With a confident smile, she replied, &#34;Team up to handle Simon? That&#39;s generous.You give him too much credit. The truth is, I can handle him on my own. The only reason I haven&#39;t acted is because I&#39;m still waiting for concrete proof.I refuse to act on suspicions alone and risk hurting the wrong person. But once I&#39;m certain he&#39;s behind all this, I won&#39;t even need your help to bring him down.Honestly, the reason I offered to work with you isn&#39;t because I need an ally against Simon. It&#39;s because | want to make sure you won&#39;t be helping him against Isaac or me. I&#39;m only interested in removing the chance of trouble down the line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena spoke her mind freely, her tone carrying both conviction and careful thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis had gone out of his way to set up this meeting,a clear sign he was open to joining forces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone like him didn&#39;t waste precious time unless he saw real value in a partnership.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood his hesitation too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon held the upper hand by threatening someone Luis cared about. Of course he would be careful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Verena&#39;s strategy covered every angle. She exposed Simon&#39;s soft spot and outlined a plan that gave Luis exactly what he needed to feel reassured about his loved one&#39;s safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That level of insight made cooperation much more likely. As her words hung in the air, Luis folded his arms and studied her with renewed interest, taking in the intelligence and cool self-assurance that radiated from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena came across as sharp, composed, and surprisingly cunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rare woman indeed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight tilt of his head, Luis leaned in closer and flashed a teasing smile. &#34;I have to admit, I like women like you. Once all this trouble is behind us, maybe you should consider leaving Isaac for someone who can match him in brains and ambition. What do you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden change in subject caught Verena off guard for a split second. She lifted an eyebrow,unbothered, and replied, &#34;You&#39;re interested in me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes stayed distant and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis let a faint smile play on his lips as he slowly stirred the coffee in his mug, the silver spoon  sending quiet ripples through the dark brew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting his gaze, he met Verena&#39;s eyes and asked with a teasing tone, &#34;Oh? Am I not allowed to? Is it somehow shameful for a man to fall for a woman?&#34;</p>
