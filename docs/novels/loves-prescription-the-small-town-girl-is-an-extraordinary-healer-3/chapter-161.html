                <p>Erick&#39;s eyes flashed with suspicion. &#34;So you really think you can stop me? Listen, the woman my brother brought back has completely vanished, and anyone can see she&#39;s up to something shady. If anything happens to my father because of her, every one of you will be held responsible. I can&#39;t just sit back and let her get away with it. Are you honestly going to stand in my way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, one of the bodyguards replied,&#34;We have strict instructions from our boss. Nobody is allowed near the hospital today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did it click for Erick that he&#39;d walked right into Tobin&#39;s setup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These bodyguards weren&#39;t amateurs. Erick might be able to handle one or two, but facing this many,he wasn&#39;t about to do anything reckless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with Erick&#39;s own group of loyal men and his significant influence in the underworld, he was outnumbered at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he reached for his phone to call for backup, a guard from behind snatched it out of his grip. &#34;Shit!&#34; Erick muttered as he lunged to reclaim his phone, only to have several guards slam him to the floor and pin him instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you have any urgent business, Mr. Fairclough,you can make your calls later,&#34; the bodyguard said coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,inside Tobin&#39;s room, Britton had no idea about the chaos erupting outside. He sat next to the bed,feeling uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin had passed out from sheer exhaustion. After giving him the necessary meds, Britton expected him to wake up soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,more than thirty minutes ticked by, and there was stilI no sign of Tobin waking up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Britton worked under Erick, he knew he&#39;d be blamed if anything happened to Tobin. Erick wouldn&#39;t hesitate to sacrifice him to keep the peace with the rest of the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Britton got up, planning to ask a servant to keep an eye on Tobin while he ran to the hospital for some extra injections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as Britton started moving, Tobin, who had only been pretending to be unconscious, quickly called out, &#34;Dr. Smith.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re awake, Mr. Fairclough,&#34; Britton said as he turned to Tobin and helped him sit upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a trembling voice, Tobin pretended to be frail.&#34;Dr. Smith, what happened to me? Why do I feel so weak?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Britton calmly explained to him what had happened,and as soon as Tobin heard about his sudden collapse,he clutched Britton&#39;s arm, eyes wide in panic. &#34;How could I just pass out like that? Is it something serious?Am I going to end up stuck in bed like my father? Dr.Smith,you have to help me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic was written all over Tobin&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Britton offered some reassurance. &#34;You don&#39;t need to worry, Mr. Fairclough. You collapsed because you pushed yourself too hard. Get some proper rest, and you&#39;ll recover quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still on edge, Tobin asked him, &#34;Are you sure? Please,double-check everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His obvious anxiety left Britton with no choice but to perform another detailed examination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Verena had made her way to Maxton&#39;s room and slipped right in with the surgical team Tobin  had arranged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Britton was temporarily held back,Verena understood that Erick would never leave only a single doctor to oversee Tobin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certain extra eyes were monitoring the situation. The remaining people might call for backup,and she feared the situation could spiral beyond her control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driven by panic, she hurried through the surgical preparations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nervous sweat formed along her hairline, soaking into her mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in a silent breath, Verena blocked everything else out, channeling all her concentration into guiding the scalpel with steady hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden noise from the hallway, a shuffle, and then the faint patter of approaching feet, snapped her focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena tightened her jaw, thrown off by how quickly the interruption came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nervous sweat pooled along her hairline, dripping down. Her palms were wet beneath her gloves, making the scalpel even harder to control. Still,Verena centered herself, determined not to let the tension in the corridor shake her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was nearly finished with the procedure.All she needed was a handful of minutes more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The footsteps outside grew louder, picking up speed as they neared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the increasing noise, Verena guessed that several people were converging right outside the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any sudden intrusion would ruin everything she&#39;d worked for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant she needed to pick up the pace as every second counted now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the door, the footsteps suddenly stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s inside? Open up now!&#34; Erick demanded,his shout echoing through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stationed bodyguards replied, &#34;Mr. Fairclough, nobody is allowed inside at the moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let&#39;s find out if you really have what it takes to keep me out,&#34; Erick shot back, signaling to his subordinate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, the man stepped forward and landed a heavy kick to the bodyguard blocking his  path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Tobin&#39;s bodyguards surged forward,launching themselves into a fistfight with Erick&#39;s men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A barrage of thumps and the scuffle of bodies slamming against walls echoed through the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the chaos outside intensified, Verena&#39;s concentration never wavered. Her hands moved with precision, closing the final stitches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was so close; only a final touch remained before she&#39;d finish the procedure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fight outside left the entrance unguarded for Erick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fixing his gaze on the door, he approached it,determined to force his way inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could reach for the handle, the door swung inward and Verena slipped out, pulling it shut behind her and cutting off his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked completely composed, and if not for the beads of sweat at her hairline, anyone could mistake her for a visitor checking in on the patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena spared a quick look at the guards now lying defeated on the floor, victims of Erick&#39;s men. Maintaining her composure, Verena offered a small smile. &#34;Mr. Fairclough, do you realize what kind of uproar you&#39;re causing by storming in with an army?Aren&#39;t you worried about disturbing your father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick glared at her, his eyes cold and full of suspicion.&#34;Who gave you permission to step into my father&#39;s room alone? No one comes near this hospital without the Fairclough family&#39;s consent. You know that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for Verena&#39;s response, he barked at his men, &#34;She broke into my father&#39;s room to do him harm.Take her away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two bodyguards closed in on Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she stood her ground, knowing full well that Erick wouldn&#39;t be here if Tobin&#39;s people were still in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, her best strategy was to buy some time for Tobin to arrive. She could only hope he&#39;d get there soon enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena folded her arms and let out a soft laugh.&#34;Mr.Fairclough, I just finished operating on your father.He&#39;ll regain consciousness shortly. Are you really planning to arrest the one person who might save him?Or are you hoping your father never wakes up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their stares locked, tension flaring between them like two blades meeting mid-strike. The moment Verena mentioned Maxton might wake up soon, a dangerous glint flashed across Erick&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only now did he realize he&#39;d completely underestimated her. She wasn&#39;t some opportunist but the very doctor his older brother had hired for the operation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d finished the procedure in record time and was now claiming a quick recovery. If Erick&#39;s instincts were right, this woman had to be the real Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization struck him hard that he&#39;d just been outsmarted by Verena and Tobin. Shadows clouded his features as he gave her a chilling smile.&#34;You really think saving my father puts you above the rules?Don&#39;t forget. He&#39;s still unconscious. If anything were to happen, you&#39;d be the first one everyone blames.Honestly, you&#39;ve made it easy for me. Now I have the perfect scapegoat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his mask gone, Erick&#39;s threats came out in the open. Verena met his gaze, her lips curling into a smirk. &#34;So this is the real Erick Fairclough, huh? No more playing nice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of sight, her fingers moved swiftly, sending a silent message to Tobin for backup as they&#39;d planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin&#39;s supposed arrest at Erick&#39;s hands was nothing more than a carefully staged deception. Tobin&#39;s team had already been stationed throughout the estate,ready to act at a moment&#39;s notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Convinced Tobin was out of the picture and his father remained helpless, Erick dropped the act. He was certain the entire estate was now under his control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Believing he&#39;d already won,Erick felt untouchable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Verena with her phone, Erick gave her a disdainful look. &#34;Really? Still hoping Tobin&#39;s going to come and rescue you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, voice dripping with sarcasm. &#34;My men have already got him locked down. He&#39;s in no position to help anyone, not even himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing Tobin needed a bit more time, Verena shifted tactics, her tone gentle and almost amused. &#34;Tell me,Mr.Fairclough, are you truly willing to throw your own father and brother under the bus? I have to admit, I&#39;m dying to know, what&#39;s your grand plan for Tobin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A twisted grin broke out across Erick&#39;s face. &#34;If he wants to fake illness so badly, then he can follow my father to the grave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cruelty was unmistakable, but Verena didn&#39;t back down. &#34;And you&#39;re not worried that people might get suspicious if they both vanish on the same day?&#34; A cold sneer played at Erick&#39;s lips, his eyes reflecting a deadly resolve. &#34;Everyone in this family will swear that Tobin just slipped into a coma out of nowhere and never woke up. No one will link it to me.And as for my father, the surveillance footage will pin everything on you and your botched surgery. In this household, I decide what the truthlooks like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in, the threat plain on his face. &#34;Once my father and Tobin are gone, I&#39;ll be the only one left to inherit everything. WVith no one standing in my way, I&#39;ll finally-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And just what is it you think you&#39;re capable of?&#34; A commanding voice rang out from the corridor,cutting through his fantasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound brought Erick to a halt, and he turned around, panic flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the far end of the hallway, Tobin appeared, leading a squad of armed men straight toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within seconds, Tobin&#39;s team overpowered Erick&#39;s guards,seizing control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick&#39;s face drained of allcolor,and he stared ahead in shock, barely able to stammer, &#34;No... This isn&#39;t happening...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin strode forward, his voice dripping with contempt. &#34;I never realized you could be this vicious,Erick. But it looks like your evil scheme just fell apart.&#34;</p>
