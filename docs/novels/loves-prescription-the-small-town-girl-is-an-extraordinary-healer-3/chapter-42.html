                <p>Verena fixed Kaia with a cool gaze, her tone indifferent. &#34;If you&#39;ve something to say, say it plainly.I&#39;ve no patience to waste time circling words with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia folded her arms, her eyes cutting sideways like a blade, a sneer curling her lips. &#34;No patience for me,yet you suddenly find boundless energy for private talks with another man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly are you suggesting?&#34; Verena&#39;s tone stayed steady, as if untouched by Kaia&#39;s provocation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia could not stomach Verena&#39;s aloofness-always so distant, always carrying herself as if the world could not touch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp motion, she pulled out her phone and thrust it forward, showing Verena a photo sent by a friend who had spotted her at a restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, you play your cards well. One hand engaged to lsaac, and the other hand holding secret meetings with a man-smiling, chatting, looking far too comfortable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smugness lit her face like a cruel lantern. &#34;Tell me,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>if lsaac saw this photo, would he still cherish the thought of marrying a woman so false-hearted? With his position, do you think he&#39;d stomach betrayal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena took the phone and glanced at the photo-her and Gavin, seated together. The angle was cunning, capturing them as if they were a young couple on a tender date, laughter shared without restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already clarified things with Isaac. What gnawed at her was how Kaia had come to possess such a photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you been following me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the frost in Verena&#39;s gaze, Kaia shivered despite herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snatching her phone back, she crossed her arms, and then stepped closer, her face twisted with defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what if I did? If your conscience is clear,why tremble? This time, my friend simply happened upon you whispering sweet nothings with another man. But I&#39;d wager you&#39;ve been roaming about with plenty of them, haven&#39;t you? Hah-just as Mom says, that old hag from your backwater roots truly ruined you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words cracked off mid-sentence, for a sharp slap resounded, striking her cheek and leaving a vivid red mark. Kaia&#39;s eyes flew wide in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You... you actually dared to hit me?&#34; Her chest heaved, fury blazing. &#34;That old hag-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another slap split her lip before she could finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching her burning cheek, Kaia staggered, utterly provoked. &#34;That old hag, that old hag-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two more slaps rang out, each echoing through the living room like thunderclaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The force nearly toppled her, but before she fell, a hand seized her collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena dragged her close, brow furrowed, eyes sharp as steel. &#34;Kaia Willis, hate me all you want-I don&#39;t care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice dropped, colder still. &#34;But hear me well: my grandmother is not yours to scorn. Speak one more word against her, and each time I&#39;ll strike without hesitation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Verena shoved Kaia hard, sending her sprawling to the floor. &#34;Don&#39;t test me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after, there was no relief in her chest. She turned from Kaia and climbed the stairs in haste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shawna had carried her worries for Kaia and Luka even  to her deathbed. What a bitter fate, to be burdened with such ungrateful kin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia sat crumpled on the floor, her cheek aflame,tears brimming as she stared up at Verena&#39;s retreating figure. Anger boiled within her, shaking her body,yet fear crept beneath it. Verena&#39;s cold mask had cracked,revealing something fierce, almost unhinged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was not that Kaia had not thought to strike back;but Verena&#39;s grip had been iron,leaving no chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fists clenched tight, hatred blazing. So what if Verena turned mad? In their parents&#39; hearts, Kaia told herself,she would always outweigh her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, Alec and Laura returned from the company to find their beloved daughter greeting them with a swollen face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sight, Alec&#39;s brows drew together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura rushed over, her eyes wet with worry.	 heavens,Kaia,what happened to your face?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,it was Verena...&#34; Kaia bit her lip, shoulders trembling as tears streamed. &#34;I spoke a few words when she came home. She claimed I meddled where I shouldn&#39;t, and then struck me again and again before shoving me to the floor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sobs were pitiful, her voice woven with grievance &#34;Verena?&#34; Alec frowned,doubtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, Verena had always been the quiet one never the sort to throw her weight about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the hesitation, Kaia pressed on, her voice pleading. &#34;Dad, it was truly her. Go upstairs and ask her yourself if you doubt me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, she was determined-Verena would pay. Her parents had always cradled her in affection. Surely,they would not let her be wronged in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kaia misjudged. Alec, seasoned by years of business, had his eyes on the larger game. Even if Verena had struck Kaia, she was about to enter the Bennett family through marriage. Trouble now would be poison in the well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice came low, reluctant. &#34;Verena&#39;s wedding with Isaac is at hand. Let&#39;s leave this matter for another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what if she marries Isaac?&#34; Laura cut in, her face drawn with disdain. &#34;I care nothing for the Bennett family&#39;s backing! Today, she dared raise her hand against Kaia in this very house, spitting on us all. Such insolence cannot go unanswered!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fury boiled over; thoughts of currying favor with the Bennetts vanished like mist. All she wished was to storm upstairs and remind Verena who truly ruled this household. Verena&#39;s conduct had long been a thorn in her side, fueling a steady undercurrent of dissatisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura made to ascend, but Alec caught her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his heart ached for Kaia, his mind weighed interests more heavily. He had not thrived in business by letting anger steer the ship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled deeply. &#34;Remember our alliance with the Bennett family through marriage. Verena&#39;s wedding is too near. Stirring conflict now would only sow weeds in our own path. The fewer storms,the better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmph, the Bennett family?&#34; Laura sneered, voice dripping scorn. &#34;Yes, we need their support, but don&#39;t fool yourself-Danica despises us. Were it not for Isaac&#39;s crippled legs, our family would never have had this chance. Do you think we&#39;d be chosen otherwise?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze shifted to Kaia, softening with pride. &#34;With Kaia,we are hardly grasping at straws. She has already won the favor of the Lyons family-she healed Barrie Lyons&#39; leg with her herbs and supplements. Their family may not rival the Bennetts outright, but they are close. To the Bennetts, we are beggars; to the Lyons family, Kaia is a benefactor. Now, tell me,which is the wiser path?&#34;</p>
