                <p>Verena&#39;s voice came through with a casual ease, as if the conversation were no more important than idle talk about the weather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the phone, shock lit up Bobby&#39;s features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of admiration swept over him; he was half-tempted to drop to his knees right there. &#34;Verena,can you believe it? Dozens of experts tried and failed to help Maxton. Some even claimed he wouldn&#39;t see the end of the year. But you turned things around; you actually healed him! Honestly,you&#39;re a miracle worker!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rattled on with so much energy that Verena barely had a chance to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on,I need to hang up now. I have to go brag to everyone about how my sister-in-law is the best in the world!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby didn&#39;t wait for her answer; he ended the call with a flourish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena couldn&#39;t help but laugh at the abrupt dial tone.She had planned to remind him not to get too involved, but honestly, having a brother-in-law so eager to sing her praises felt surprisingly nice.He was certainly a step up from her own brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time after the call, Bobby jumped into the wealthy young people&#39;s group chat to set the record straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers flew across the keyboard. &#34;All of you were wondering why Verena would bother with a man almost twice her age? Here&#39;s the real story:she went abroad to treat MMaxton Fairclough. That&#39;s right, the same Maxton who runs Smoothdeed Group. Pretty wild, huh? You&#39;re all well aware of Maxton&#39;s position,and the fact that plenty of schemers have their eyes on him. To keep these schemers from stirring up trouble or interfering with his recovery, Verena assumed this identity as a shield for her own protection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly sent another message. &#34;So all those rumors? Pure nonsense! And here&#39;s the big news: she&#39;s managed to cure Maxton. Give it a few days, and he&#39;ll wake up to clear her name himself. Maybe think twice before you start gossiping; you&#39;re only setting yourselves up for embarrassment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chat immediately lit up after Bobby&#39;s bombshell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious, Bobby?&#34; &#34;Verena managed to cure Maxton? That just doesn&#39;t sound believable...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;d been out cold for over six months, and even the best doctors couldn&#39;t crack his case. How could she pull off a cure after just a few days abroad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many in the group had always been quick to doubt Verena, but there were also quite a few who trusted her skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that going too far? Have you forgotten she&#39;s the one who saved Barrie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! Barrie saw specialist after specialist, and not a single one could help, except for Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If she handled Barrie&#39;s complicated illness,maybe Verena isn&#39;t getting enough credit here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Voices of support chimed in. &#34;Bobby&#39;s not one to exaggerate. Maybe Verena really did go overseas for Maxton&#39;s sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few, unfamiliar with Maxton&#39;s name, jumped online to dig up information. What they found left them speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold up, I just searched him. Over the past six months, every doctor who tried failed, and a few even lost their lives. Treating Maxton was no walk in the  park.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No wonder Verena needed to hide her identity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the group&#39;s conversation shifted, with more members admiring Verena&#39;s courage and skill, Bobby read along, a proud grin spreading across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side, Kaia observed as the conversation turned,with most of the group members marveling at Verena&#39;s medical abilities while the few doubters were swiftly silenced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did things turn around so quickly?&#34; Kaia mumbled under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow furrowed as she quickly sent Bobby&#39;s update over to Katelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She followed up and asked, &#34;Katelyn, do you think there&#39;s any truth to what Bobby said?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reading the forwarded chat, Katelyn&#39;s expression twisted with skepticism and disdain. The idea that Verena could heal Maxton was laughable. Anyone could make bold claims, but how could Verena possibly prove it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Months ago, Tobin had asked Katelyn to help Maxton,but after looking over his files, she&#39;d immediately declined the case. She knew there was no way she could save Maxton. Katelyn had never managed to help Maxton, yet now Verena, just a Pine Hill grad with nothing noteworthy to her name, was out here claiming she&#39;d performed a miracle? If anyone was unremarkable, it was Verena.How could she have the nerve to make such wild boasts?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn scoffed to herself, brushing it off as nothing more than Verena&#39;s desperate bid to save her reputation. What nonsense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint, dismissive snort, Katelyn tapped out a message for Kaia. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. Verena&#39;s all talk and no substance. All she does is run her mouth.Didn&#39;t she say Maxton would be up and about in a few days? We&#39;ll see if she can actually pull it off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia gave it some thought, and her earlier anxiety faded away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she remembered the group singing Verena&#39;s praises, the more irritated she felt. She texted Katelyn back. &#34;You&#39;re right. We&#39;ll sit back and watch her embarrass herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,the wealthy elites&#39; online discussion about Verena&#39;s supposed affair with Tobin had reached Isaac&#39;s ears. He sat in his office, cool gaze dropped to the floor,a sharp edge in his posture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no mystery about where this rumor had come from; Katelyn&#39;s handiwork was obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he&#39;d never cared how Katelyn treated him,dragging Verena into her games was crossing the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes narrowed at the thought. Overseas,Katelyn&#39;s antics had always followed her from one scandal to another, though in front of him, she never broke her innocent facade. But thanks to Stevie&#39;s long stay abroad, Isaac had heard all the real stories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He considered his options for a moment, and then picked up his phone and dialed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stevie&#39;s voice came through the line, easy and teasing.&#34;What&#39;s going on, man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac got right to the point. &#34;I need some dirt on someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t ask for help often, which only piqued Stevie&#39;s interest. &#34;Who&#39;s the unlucky target?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting his gaze, lsaac replied, voice cool and steady,&#34;Katelyn Fuller.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stevie went quiet for a second, and then let out a  knowing laugh. &#34;So you&#39;ve finally decided to deal with your stalker.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stevie wasted no time. By the time Isaac wrapped up his next meeting, a hefty folder had already landed in his inbox, overflowing with video clips, photos, and all sorts of incriminating material.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac arched an eyebrow, his eyes narrowing as he scrolled through the evidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed a button. &#34;Jacob.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob appeared at the door,ready for orders. &#34;How can I help, Mr. Bennett?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s words were measured, his voice tinged with chill. &#34;Check your email. Take what I just sent and get in touch with some of the more influential entertainment agencies. Make sure the story comes out hard and leaves no room for sympathy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob nodded, accepting the task without question.&#34;Yes,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slipped out as quietly as he&#39;d entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning backin his chair, Isaac folded his arms and let his gaze linger on the newly received fie. If Katelyn wanted to turn his wife&#39;s name into tabloid fodder, she was about to find out just how ruthless public backlash could feel.</p>
