                <p>Shock rippled through Laura as her gaze landed on Kaia, who had rushed to stand between her and danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of astonishment crossed Alec&#39;s face; Kaia&#39;s sudden intervention had clearly caught him off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Alec refused to show a hint of embarrassment at the situation. His hands clasped behind him; his stern demeanor remained unchanged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, Laura shook off her shock, stepped forward, and drew Kaia close in a tight hug. She let her frustration spill out at Alec. &#34;How long will this go on, Alec? Ever since Verena came here, this family has been falling apart. I&#39;ve tried everything-I&#39;ve humbled myself, lost my pride, and still, nothing changes. If that&#39;s how it is, I&#39;m done. From now on, you deal with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t wait for a response. Laura led Kaia away and guided her upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside Kaia&#39;s bedroom, Laura gently traced the outline of Kaia&#39;s puffy cheek, sorrow filling her eyes. &#34;Why would you throw yourself in the middle of that? You know your father&#39;s temper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia knew firsthand how harsh Alec could be. Yet, unlike him, Laura&#39;s care was real-she was the one most likely to soften if Kaia reached out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura would stay by her side, no matter what Alec chose to do for his own benefit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia couldn&#39;t afford to lose both, so she kept one close just in case things fell apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia took one look at how Laura reacted and figured stepping in had been the right call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears pricked Kaia&#39;s eyes, and her nose tingled as she sniffled. &#34;If I hadn&#39;t gotten between you, you&#39;d be the one hurting, Mom. I just couldn&#39;t let that happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s own tears threatened to fall, but she managed a warm,gentle smile.silly girl. At least I know all the love I gave you wasn&#39;t wasted. Let&#39;s do something about that swelling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She soon returned with ointment in hand. Dipping a swab into the cream, Laura carefully applied it to Kaia&#39;s face. The sting made Kaia flinch, but she didn&#39;t regret standing up for her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to ease the tension, Laura spoke softly. &#34;Try not to blame your father. He thinks he&#39;s protecting us.The club&#39;s closure has kept him up every night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s eyes, still red, met her mother&#39;s. She nodded quietly.&#34;|get it, Mom. I&#39;m not mad at him. Maybe Verena didn&#39;t help us because we never really included her. Honestly, I&#39;d feel out of place too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That confession made Laura pause for a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t forgotten the scandal stirred up by Slater&#39;s post about Kaia. But seeing her daughter&#39;s sincerity,Laura dismissed the incident as unimportant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was calm. &#34;We gave her a home and every chance to succeed. She&#39;s got no reason to resent us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile touched Kaia&#39;s lips as she changed the subject. &#34;Mom, do you remember when Verena took her college entrance exams?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While tending to Kaia&#39;s cheek, Laura&#39;s thoughts wandered back to Verena&#39;s school days. She hesitated,recalling, &#34;You know, I don&#39;t think she actually sat for the exams. Why are you asking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s eyes reflected regret as she spoke. &#34;Everything that&#39;s happened to Willis Group is really on me. When Verena first came home, I was afraid of losing your affection, so I kept my distance. My mistakes led us here,and I want to make things right. I also need to learn about her history-maybe then I can fix what I&#39;ve done.Don&#39;t worry, Mom. I&#39;ll talk to her and ask her to stop targeting us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura reached over, pride shining in her expression. &#34;You&#39;re being so thoughtful, Kaia. That makes me proud. Your father will be pleased when he hears this.&#34; After thinking for a moment, Laura recalled the timing. &#34;It was the year Luka got seriously ill. Seven years ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Laura mentioned the year, Kaia nearly leapt from her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That put Verena in Adrian&#39;s graduating class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, Kaia quickly connected the dots. provoked her until she left. Now look where we are! We can&#39;t hold on to anything!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing patience, Laura pushed his hand aside. &#34;Alec Wilis, stop pretending you&#39;re blameless. Every timetrouble comes, you wash your hands clean. Don&#39;t pin this on me. Even if l was wrong, you agreed to it. Allyou ever do is bully your family while cowering before outsiders. Why don&#39;t you go confront lsaac if youdare? lf luck hadn&#39;t handed you a friend to invest with, you&#39;d still be the same good-for-nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec, proud to a fault, could never bear his weakness being spoken aloud, even in private.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s words cut him to the quick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia knew her father well. With Laura&#39;s tongue so sharp, she was inviting his fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resolve flickered in Kaia&#39;s eyes as she hurried down the stairs</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, Alec&#39;s face was twisted with rage. He raised his hand high. &#34;Shut your mouth, you witch!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blow fell swiftly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smack! The sound cracked through the room as the heavy slap landed-not on Laura, but on Kaia, who hadrushed in, her head snapping to the side. Adrian passed the phone back and shrugged. &#34;That&#39;s not for sure. The university is massive, and each department is full of students. There&#39;s no way to know everyone in your year.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the disappointment on Kaia&#39;s face, Adrian tried to reassure her. &#34;Let me reach out to a buddy of mine-he knows more schoolmates than me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grateful for the offer, Kaia nodded. &#34;That would help a lot. I&#39;ll send you her picture right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian forwarded the photo, and then quickly dialed his friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wesley, I just texted you a photo. Take a look-do you recognize this girl from back then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Wesley Seymour&#39;s voice sounded rough, like he&#39;d just woken up after a wild night. &#34;Give me a sec.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few moments ticked by before Wesley let out a low whistle. &#34;Whoa, where&#39;d you get a stunner like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling his eyes, Adrian clarified, saying, &#34;She&#39;s not someone I know personally. I&#39;m asking for a friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s enthusiasm faded. &#34;Ah, I get it. Sorry to disappoint, but she doesn&#39;t ring a bell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Adrian hung up, Kaia leaned in, anxious for the answer. &#34;Did he recognize her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;Nope. If a girl like that had been around, especially with my friend&#39;s reputation, he would have noticed her for sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Kaia felt a surge of satisfaction she hadn&#39;t experienced in ages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Verena truly healed Barrie, a lie about her academic background would stick like a stain that couldn&#39;t be washed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All Kaia needed was a sliver of doubt-a few hundred people out of a thousand-casting shadows on Verena&#39;s story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for a grand wedding? What a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena wanted to marry into a rich family smoothly? Things weren&#39;t going to fall into place that easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Verena&#39;s secret came out on her wedding day, it would be the perfect scandal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly smile curled on Kaia&#39;s lips, her confidence blooming as if victory was already hers.</p>
