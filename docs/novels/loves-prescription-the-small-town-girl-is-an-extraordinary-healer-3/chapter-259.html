                <p>Isaac&#39;s voice came out rough, laced with a tremor he could not quite bury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing such good news, Verena too felt her heart overflow. Tears shimmered in her eyes as she bent low, her arms circling his neck, clihging to him as if afraid to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her cheek pressed to his shoulder, her voice quivered with the same unsteady warmth. &#34;Isaac, I told you-what we&#39;ve gone through will never be in vain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, lsaac pored over Verena&#39;s medical report as though missing a single line would be a sin too heavy to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave a helpless little laugh. &#34;It&#39;s fine.Everything checks out. You can breathe easy now. Since that&#39;s settled, I&#39;ll return to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Isaac caught her hand firmly. &#34;No. You&#39;re still not steady on your feet. You&#39;re not going to work today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He immediately gave his order to Jacob. &#34;Back to Seraphina Villas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob glanced over his shoulder, nodded, and replied with due respect, &#34;Yes,Mr.Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Verena even gathered her wits, the car was already gliding toward Seraphina Villas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced down at their tightly entwined hands,and her lips lifted in a faint, tender curve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew well-Isaac&#39;s worry was written all over his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truth be told, after the check-up, weariness was pressing down like a heavy cloak. So she didn&#39;t argue further,letting him lead her home without protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the car came to a halt, Verena stepped out slowly, only to see Jacob helping Isaac down as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, her eyes widened. &#34;You rushed out of the office-don&#39;t you have pressing matters waiting?You&#39;re not going back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, a mountain of work awaited him. Yet beside Verena, all of it seemed pale and hollow. Isaac answered simply, his eyes brimming with devotion,&#34;I&#39;Il stay with you. Only then will I find peace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena let out a soft laugh, half-teasing, &#34;It&#39;s only been a few weeks-the baby hasn&#39;t even stirred yet.Isn&#39;t this too much fuss? Go handle your work. I only need a nap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac shook his head gently, his gaze warm. &#34;Then..I&#39;l stay until you fall asleep. Only after that will l leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His anxious insistence brought a radiant smnile to Verena&#39;s face. She stepped closer, erasing the distance until their breaths mingled in the narrow space between them. As she watched him tense, mischief flickered in her eyes. In a playful tone, she teased, &#34;So clingy? What a pity! With a baby on the way, you can&#39;t do a thing...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her soft, lilting voice struck him straight to the core.Her eyes searched his face, clearly waiting for his reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, Isaac flushed crimson and ducked his head,utterly undone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him, Verena chuckled under her breath,clasped her hands behind her back, and strolled away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her footsteps faded, Isaac lifted his head slightly, said nothing, and quietly maneuvered his wheelchair to follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the bedroom, Verena slipped into the bathroom. She splashed cold water onto her face,and then reached for her phone from the rack and dialed a number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, the line connected. &#34;Dr. Owen, hello. This is Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther&#39;s deep voice sounded steady on the line.&#34;Mrs. Bennett, has there been a change in Mr.Bennett&#39;s condition?&#34;</p>
