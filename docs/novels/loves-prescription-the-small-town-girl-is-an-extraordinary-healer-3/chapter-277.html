                <p>In the heart of the bustling city, inside an elegant restaurant, Verena sat in a private dining room, her fingertips drumming softly against the polished table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t long before Simon pushed the door open and stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore a crisp white shirt beneath a tailored dark suit jacket, trousers pressed to perfection-every detail carefully chosen to present his best self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant his gaze landed on Verena, a smile surfaced on his lips, and a faintgleam lit his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, have you been waiting long?&#34; he asked warmly, sliding into the seat opposite her, leaning in as though to bridge the space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way he spoke her first name carried a weight of familiarity, tinged with a trace of desire, as though they were far closer than they truly were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s brow tightened ever so slightly at the address, a quiet ripple of distaste rising within her. Yet Simon appeared blind to his boldness, keeping his expression open and sincere, as though innocence itself clothed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting his head, his voice low and persuasive, he added, &#34;Since this isn&#39;t the hospital and we&#39;re past working hours, I thought it would be fine to call you by your real name, Verena, instead of Evelyn or Dr.Willis...right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved faintly, though inwardly she scoffed at his carefully staged humility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a small nod and answered lightly, &#34;Of course. No problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her words landed, a spark of concealed delight flickered in Simon&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, he congratulated himself. If patience was a ladder, he believed each careful step would carry him closer into Verena&#39;s guarded heart. Masking his satisfaction, Simon recalled their previous meeting, which had unfortunately turned toward Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined not to stumble on the same stone twice, he redirected the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat, tugged discreetly at his collar, and then asked with a polite smile, &#34;Verena, I was wondering-was there a particular aspect of psychology you wished to talk about today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lifted her chin slightly, her gaze steady as water yet sharp as glass. Her voice rang calm and deliberate. &#34;To be honest, I&#39;d already done a fair amount of research on you before we met today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His modest mask slipped for a heartbeat-eyebrows arching, eyes widening-before disbelief gave way to visible delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, he convinced himself she was truly intrigued by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the flash of delight on his face, Verena continued evenly, &#34;From what I&#39;ve learned, Dr. Moss, you once practiced at Clokron&#39;s most renowned psychological hospital, showing remarkable brilliance at a young age. A few years ago, the field of psychology faced daunting challenges. Several complex cases baffled even the most seasoned experts. They tried every traditional method, even the newest innovations,yet nothing worked. But with sharp insight, rare patience, and unmatched skill, you succeeded where others failed. Your efforts didn&#39;t just redeem your patients and their families-they opened new horizons for the entire field. That contribution alone deserves admiration. Beyond medicine, Dr. Moss, you&#39;re known for your generosity. Your name often appears on major donation lists, your charity work constant and sincere. Truly,you&#39;re a doctor worthy of respect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s eyes shimmered, every word feeding his vanity like a thirsty plant drinking in the rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smug smile ghosted across his lips, so brief it almost went unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, he reveled in the fact that wearing Simon Moss&#39;s identity was like carrying a master key-it opened doors straight into Verena&#39;s esteem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But quickly adjusting his expression, he straightened his tie with a gentleman&#39;s air and replied with measured grace, &#34;These were merely my duties. I only did what I could. As for the charity work, that&#39;s the least I can offer. But you, Verena...&#34; He smiled warmly. &#34;You&#39;ve cured countless difficult cases yourself. Every medical student looks up to you. Honestly, the reason I entered this field at all was largely because you inspired me-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Verena&#39;s eyes snapped to his, cold and cutting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That gaze, sharp as an eagle&#39;s, seemed to strip away his carefully constructed facade and pierce straight to the marrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice, soft yet heavy with steel, cut him short. &#34;But I was talking about Dr. Moss. What does that have to do with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words fell quiet as snowfall, yet struck like a hammer. Simon froze, his rehearsed speech crumbling to dust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stare held him in place; his smile warped, and his heart clenched as if caught in a vice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he forced composure, his throat tight, his voice trembling beneath its casual mask. &#34;But I am Simon Moss, Verena. I don&#39;t understand what you mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena did not answer at once. Her silence pressed in on him like a storm cloud, her gaze unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands curled into fists under the table, knuckles blanching as the pause stretched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, she narrowed her eyes, each word edged in frost. &#34;You don&#39;t know what I mean? A thief long enough begins to believe the stolen life is his own. Carl Aguilar, you killed Simon, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t a question but a verdict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s temple throbbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her words, he realized the mask had slipped, the truth laid bare. She knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if his secret was out, there was no sense in clinging to the charade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a mask ripped from the stage, his tenderness vanished. In its place rose a twisted obsession,.dark and merciless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze locked on Verena-predatory, coiled, his eyes like a serpent fixing on its prey.&#34;SO111he drawled,his voice cold, &#34;you&#39;ve been investigating me all this time, Evelyn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hollow chuckle followed. &#34;I still prefer Evelyn. That&#39;s what I called you the first time we met, remember?&#34;</p>
