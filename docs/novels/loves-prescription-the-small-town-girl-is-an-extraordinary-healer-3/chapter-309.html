            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Verena bent slightly as lsaac put the shawl on her shoulders. She pulled it tighter as if to ward off the chill riding on the night wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda watched with a playful smile tugging at her lips. &#34;Oh, come now. I was only jesting.I wasn&#39;t truly upset. It&#39;s just astonishing-who would have guessed you&#39;re the Sampson family&#39;s daughter? That&#39;s quite the twist of fate, like turning a page and finding a different story written there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena glanced toward the silent Luis before replying,&#34;Ah,yes,Miranda.Let me introduce you properly. This is my elder brother, Luis Sampson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Luis, she added warmly, &#34;Luis, this is Miranda Brown-the CEO of AuroraNexus in Clokron,and my dear friend since college. She&#39;s stood by me through thick and thin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda lifted her eyes to Luis, a playful arch in her gaze, and extended her hand. &#34;Mr. Sampson, it has been a long while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone carried a hidden undercurrent, as though some unspoken tale lingered between her words. Luis met her eyes, and for a fleeting moment,emotions stirred like ripples across still water. Then,as quickly as they came,they vanished;leaving only calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was steady as he clasped her hand politely.&#34;Miss Brown, your achievements are commendable.Managing AuroraNexus with such success is no small feat. And thank you for watching over my sister all these years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s smile deepened, her tone light. &#34;Mr.Sampson, you&#39;re too generous with your praise. I&#39;ve always considered Verena as family, so it&#39;s only natural I care for her. But if you truly wish to thank me,perhaps you could treat me to a meal sometime?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before she released his hand, her fingertip brushed lightly against his palm-subtle as a feather,yet carrying an unmistakable hint of flirtation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; frame stiffened almost imperceptibly. His brows lifted in brief surprise, and then his composure returned like a mask slipped back into place.He smiled, steering the moment elsewhere. &#34;The party will be starting soon. Verena, why don&#39;t you take your friend inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena caught the faint tension between them.Though curiosity tugged at her, she chose to let  it rest for now. She simply nodded and smiled at Miranda. &#34;It&#39;s too breezy here at the door. Let&#39;s head in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the hall, Miranda accepted a glass of red wine from Verena, though her eyes still lingered on the entrance, savoring the earlier exchange. &#34;I truly didn&#39;t expect him to be your brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following her friend&#39;s gaze, Verena noticed Luis speaking with Isaac at the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned back to Miranda, frowning slightly.&#34;Miranda, what exactly is going on between you and my brother? From the moment you two met,something felt... unusual. Do you know each other well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Know each other well?&#34; Miranda mused, and then leaned close to Verena&#39;s ear with a mischievous smile.&#34;Tell me-does a one-night stand count as familiar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena froze in shock, demanding,&#34;When? What on earth happened between you two?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda straightened, shrugging with feigned nonchalance. &#34;It&#39;s a long tale. Years ago, I was drunk and crossed paths with him. Sparks flew,we&#39;re both adults-what followed was inevitable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena struggled to reconcile the image of her composed brother with the phrase &#34;one-night stand.&#34;  Glancing at Luis in the distance, she shook her head.&#34;Miranda, this... this is absurd. My brother has always been the picture of restraint. How could he possibly -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s lips curved into a sly smile, her eyes glinting with meaning. &#34;You&#39;re mistaken. His calm is only a mask. In private, he&#39;s a very different man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swirled the wine in her glass, her gaze slipping through the rim as though peering into memory, her eyes darting toward Luis again and again, lost briefly in recollection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, hesitant, asked, &#34;So... are you actually interested in him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s smile widened into playful boldness. &#34;I&#39;m interested in his looks. And, to be frank, his performance and his appearance left me quite satisfied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She delivered those words with deliberate ambiguity,her eyes glimmering with mischief, as if enjoying Verena&#39;s discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena found herself speechless, caught off guard by her friend&#39;s candor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, she sipped her juice and asked, &#34;So...are you hooked on himn?&#34; Miranda tilted her chin thoughtfully, a dreamy half-smile on her lips. &#34;Hooked on? Hard to say. But the aftereffects? Oh, they linger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her friend&#39;s frivolous air, Verena sighed.&#34;Miranda, could you be serious for once? You leave me at a loss for words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still grinning, Miranda nudged her shoulder playfully.&#34;Luck is on my side now. He&#39;s your brother, after all.With this connection, how could I not succeed?Verena,why not lend me a hand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressed by Miranda&#39;s persistence, Verena finally relented. &#34;Alright,alright. I&#39;ll bring him over. After that,it&#39;s up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s eyes sparkled with triumph as she patted her chest in assurance. &#34;Rest easy. Everything is under control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena sighed softly, scanning the hall for Luis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, the guests had filled the room, the party humming with lively chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis stood not far away, conversing with several business magnates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tall stature and dignified bearing made him stand out like a lighthouse amid the crowd. Spotting him, Verena wove her way over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After waiting for her moment, she, gently tapped his arm and whispered, &#34;Luis, may I speak with you for a moment? There&#39;s something I need to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis turned, a flicker of surprise crossing his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He excused himself politely, saying, &#34;Gentlemen,if you&#39;ll allow me,I must attend to my sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He and Verena stepped into a quieter corner.&#34;Verena,what is it? Has something happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her lip, hesitating, and then decided to stick to Miranda&#39;s plan. &#34;Luis, Miranda... she wvants to speak with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression stilled for a beat. As though sensing the weight of someone&#39;s gaze,he lifted his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There sat Miranda, chin resting on one hand, her wine glass raised in salute, her smile radiant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis looked away, his face smooth and unreadable.&#34;Miss Brown? And what matter does she wish to discuss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena cleared her throat, stumbling slightly. &#34;She mentioned... she mentioned a possible business collaboration she&#39;d like to explore with you.&#34; A spark of skepticism flitted through Luis&#39; eyes,making Verena uneasy under his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just when she thought he might see through her,Luis shifted his eyes aside and gave a small nod. &#34;If it concerns business, I&#39;ll listen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena exhaled quietly in relief, pointing toward Miranda. &#34;She&#39;s waiting over there. Go on, Luis.I won&#39;t intrude on your conversation.&#34;</p>
