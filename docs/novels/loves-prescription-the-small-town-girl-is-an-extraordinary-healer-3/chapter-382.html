                <p>The middle-aged man nodded, his words tumbling out with determination. &#34;Mr. Kirk, everything is secure. I&#39;ve already struck a deal with Rowland. If hebrings Luis to the appointed spot, his grandparents walk free, and he pockets a hefty payout. The moment he heard it, his face lit up; he&#39;s desperate to see this plan through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Keep watch and update me the instant anything changes.&#34; Sherwood dismissed him with a flick of his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking the order for what it was, the man slipped out of the office without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alone again, Sherwood let his attention settle on the glowing monitor that displayed Sampson Group&#39;s internal files. A sly grin tugged at the corners of his lips</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Luis recently directed his assistant, Neville, to dig deep into the doctor and driver connected to Verena&#39;s abduction years ago, the one carried out by Howe,Neville brought the latest findings within three days</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spread the papers across the desk, flipping briskly to marked sections. &#34;Mr. Sampson, our review uncovered several hospitals that tampered with records during that period. And these drivers, their travel paths match Howe&#39;s movements almost exactly.They&#39;re highly suspicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis studied the documents, his expression hardening as his eyes locked on the sections tied to Verena&#39;s disappearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was low, steady. &#34;Neville, we&#39;ve broken through. Those hospitals and those drivers must become our immediate focus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted his gaze, sharp and unwavering. &#34;Form a unit and investigate them one by one. If you find anyone questionable, move in fast and take control before they react.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neville straightened, thumping his chest with conviction. &#34;Understood, Mr. Sampson. We&#39;ll be careful but decisive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a short pause, Neville stepped closer, his voice dropping. &#34;There is something else. My latest findings suggest a man named Rowland Green has been pulled into Sherwood&#39;s pocket. It looks like coercion mixed with promises of reward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; pen paused for a breath before moving again.His calm reaction revealed little, though it was clear he had already anticipated this outcome when he sent Neville digging in that direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of spending time with Sherwood had taught Luis the shape of his enemy, and he understood how far Sherwood would push to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing about Sherwood&#39;s methods surprised him; the man stopped at very little to seize an advantage.If Sherwood chose to undermine the Sampson family,Luis knew he would try to peel allies away and sow discord. Still, the family&#39;s inner circle held firm, loyal and watchful, so simple infiltration was unlikely to work. Beyond that, since Sherwood decided to frame the Sampson family with illegal transactions, he would surely turn his attention to the employees who had access to the edges of the company&#39;s core business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis leaned back and closed his eyes briefly,brow smoothing as he gathered his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he opened them again, his focus returned, and he fixed Neville with intent. &#34;I figured he&#39;d try something like this,&#34; Luis said, his voice steady. &#34;Tell me everything about Rowland.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neville flipped through a fresh notebook and spoke with measured clarity. &#34;Rowland started out doing small delivery runs and seemed reliable. Lately,he frequents places tied to Sherwood, and his movements have grown secretive. Our inquiry revealed he was raised by his grandparents after losing  his parents. We checked on his grandparents and learned they have been away from home for a long stretch. All signs point to coercion or bribery by Sherwood&#39;s people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis tapped the table once, thoughtful and calm.After a moment, he spoke with resolve. &#34;Sherwood is using the oldest trick in the book: threaten the family to bend the man. Now that we know, we cannot let this plan take hold.&#34;</p>
