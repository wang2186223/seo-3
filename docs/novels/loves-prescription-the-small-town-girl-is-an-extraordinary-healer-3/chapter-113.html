                <p>By the time the last guest left and the wedding wound down, the clock had already pushed past ten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they returned to Seraphina Villas, both Verena and Isaac showered. Later, Verena settled at her vanity, carefully going through her skincare routine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac wheeled himself out of the bathroom,she helped him ease onto the bed so he could rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes swept the space around him. Festive decorations filled the bedroom, new linens brightened the bed, and above the headboard,a framed wedding portrait stared back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every detail pressed the same truth into his mind-this was their wedding night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden tension crept into his expression, his lips pressing thin as unease clouded his gaze. Tonight should have been the night for intimacy,but his condition made that impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze dropped to the new blanket covering his legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Verena finished her routine, she noticed Isaac&#39;s slumped posture and troubled face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, she walked over, took his face between her hands, and tilted it up. &#34;Why the long face?Today&#39;s supposed to be a celebration. Smile for me,&#34;she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her skin carried the faint fragrance of her lotions,and Isaac breathed it in as he murmured, &#34;Are you let down by me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena frowned slightly. &#34;Let down? What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took him a moment before he confessed, voice low.&#34;We&#39;re married now. This is supposed to be a romantic night for intimacy. But with my health...I can&#39;t give you what you deserve.&#34; Before he could say more, Verena cut him off with a laugh. &#34;Honestly, who still clings to that idea? Just because it&#39;s our wedding night doesn&#39;t mean we have to do anything. And between you and me, I&#39;m exhausted after the long day. I don&#39;t think either of us has the energy for more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned closer, pressing her forehead against his.&#34;So quit worrying. I&#39;m fine with things just as they are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint twitch passed through Isaac&#39;s brows as he dropped his gaze, his eyes settling blankly on the deep red of Verena&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she truly mean that... or did she simply not want any real intimacy with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would her answer be the same if the man before her wasn&#39;t him but the first love she once cherished?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought looped in lsaac&#39;s head until the pressure in his throat forced him back into the present. No-that wasn&#39;t right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena belonged to him now, his wife by choice and by law. Not even the shadow of the man she once adored could take her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you getting drowsy?&#34; Verena asked as she suddenly let go of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac blinked a few times, forcing the conflict from his expression so she wouldn&#39;t catch on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave the smallest shake of his head. &#34;Not exactly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze lingered on him, and a sly smile tugged at her lips. With one finger, she traced down the edge of his collar until it hooked around the final button.&#34;Then maybe we ought to find something else to pass the time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pulse throbbed against his temples, and for a moment he had no words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t she just said she was too exhausted for anything? Why change her mind so suddenly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could voice the question, Verena hopped from the bed with a burst of laughter. &#34;Never mind.You don&#39;t need to give me an answer.Since you&#39;ve got too much on your mind to rest, I&#39;ll just give you another treatment session instead. Wait here-I&#39;ll fetch the medical kit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not giving him the chance to argue, she darted out of the room and soon came back with the slim medical case in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac remained slow to react until the first silver needle pierced his skin, sending a sharp jolt along his nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was what she had meant by &#34;something else&#34;-it was tending to his health.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the gates of Willis Villa, the car rolled to a stop.Alec climbed out first, dragging Kaia behind himas her cries of pain cut through the night, proof of the strength in his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled by the sudden uproar, Laura and Luka exchanged uneasy looks. Snapping at the servants who lingered nearby, Laura yelled, &#34;What are you standing around for? Leave at once!&#34; Luka, however,hurried after Alec to see what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething with rage, Alec dragged Kaia into the living room and shoved her forward with such force she stumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thrown off balance, Kaia nearly crashed to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad...&#34; Kaia called out, but a sudden slap cut through the air and struck her cheek hard. The sound rang out, sharp and unforgiving. Her face flushed with heat as pain rippled through her in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his hand still trembling, Alec jabbed a finger toward her, his voice rough with fury. &#34;I told you not to cause trouble at Verena&#39;s wedding. You didn&#39;t listen. Now you&#39;ll pay for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panicked, Kaia spun to run upstairs, but his hand caught her hair and yanked her backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fueled by anger, Alec dragged her down and threw her onto the sofa, his palm striking her again and again before she could even raise her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her ears rang until the room seemed to vanish, tears spilling over bruises as her hair tangled wildly across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura and Luka burst in at that moment, horrified by the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura rushed forward to seize Alec&#39;s arm, while Luka bent to help Kaia up from the cushions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Kaia finally lifted her head, her face was so swollen and bruised Luka could barely recognize her.&#34;Kaia...&#34; he whispered in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her daughter&#39;s condition, Laura&#39;s voice cracked as she screamed, &#34;Stop, Alec! Stop it before you kill her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec&#39;s chest rose and fell heavily as he wrenched his arm free , shoving Laura aside so she collapsed to the  floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaia ended up like this because you kept shielding her. Do you even see what we&#39;ve done? We&#39;ve seriously offended Verena and the entire Bennett family. If you keep standing up for her, she&#39;ll drag this whole family down with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice thundered through the house, each word ringing in Laura&#39;s ears. Fear gripped her so tightly her teeth chattered, and though she wanted to defend Kaia,she knew Alec spoke the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bennett family was far beyond their reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Verena had become someone they could never afford to cross.</p>
