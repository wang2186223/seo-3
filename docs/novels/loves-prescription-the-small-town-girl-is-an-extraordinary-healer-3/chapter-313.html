                <p>Sherwood&#39;s gaze, almost against his will, drifted toward Verena seated in the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never in his wildest dreams had he thought she was Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyelid twitched, betraying the storm beneath the calm surface, and a glimmer of shock mingled with fleeting excitement flashed across his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five minutes before the party officially began, Luis stepped back into the main hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had just finished her cereal when she caught sight of him from the corner of her eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rose gracefully and called out, &#34;Luis, you&#39;re back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without slowing his pace, Luis cast her a quick sidelong glance and gave a slight nod. His words came briskly. &#34;The party is about to begin. We should get prepared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he strode past her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena inclined her head, and then turned to lsaac and said, &#34;I&#39;ll go with Luis now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She followed after her brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she moved, a faint, elusive fragrance slipped into her nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She inhaled lightly, and her pupils tightened with sudden recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Miranda&#39;s perfume.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite Miranda&#39;s fiery temper, she always favored a fragrance that sang a different tune: elegant,subdued,a delicate blend of jasmine and woody notes echoing timeless grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena knew Miranda&#39;s quirks well; the woman never used more than a drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless Luis and Miranda had been in close quarters,the scent would never linger on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of curiosity stirred in Verena&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brother and Miranda...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had just passed between them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing Miranda&#39;s bold spirit, Verena wondered if she had taken the first daring step toward Luis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts were cut short by the deep, resonant voice of the emcee, rolling across the hall.&#34;Distinguished guests, welcome to the Sampson family&#39;s party celebrating the return of their beloved daughter. Please, join me in welcoming Mr. Luis Sampson and his sister to the stage...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis turned at once,extending his hand toward Verena.She gathered her thoughts, placed her hand upon his arm,and together they advanced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes followed them-gazes heavy with admiration,curiosity, and judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lifted her chin slightly, straightened her back,and let a gentle smile play on her lips. Confidence wrapped around her like a cloak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the back rows, cameras clicked relentlessly. The instant Verena and Luis stepped into the spotlight, the room lit up with flashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The front row was dominated by business giants,sharp suits framing faces of gravity and calculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis strode to the center of thestage,posture firm as a pillar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He adjusted the microphone, calm-faced, his stern brows softened with a touch of humility. Then, his deep,magnetic voice carried through the hall. &#34;Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for honoring us with your presence.I am Luis Sampson,CEO of Sampson Group. Because of my parents&#39; poor health, they could not be here today and asked me to host this event on their behalf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall quieted instantly, the audience hanging on his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis paused, and then turned slightly toward Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes softened, filled with the tenderness of an elder brother reunited with his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena met his gaze with a smile of her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing forward once more, Luis&#39; voice rose as he declared, &#34;As many of you already know, this young lady, Verena, is the daughter of our Sampson family -lost to us for more than twenty years. Her safe return brings us boundless joy, and tonight we proudly introduce her to you all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Applause thundered through the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guests whispered among themselves,	some astonished to learn that she was Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Luis gestured to the microphone, Verena stepped forward, her smile poised, her nod courteous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the spotlight, her face shone with quiet refinement, features sculpted with clarity, her eyes luminous. She parted her lips and spoke, her calm, steady tone ringing through the hall. &#34;Ladies and gentlemen, I am Verena. Please don&#39;t call me Miss Sampson; I&#39;m accustomed to my name as it is. Call me Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, her posture straight, her presence collected. Her voice carried like a bell as she continued, &#34;It is a privilege to stand here. Returning to the Sampson family marks a new beginning for me.From this day forward, I will join hands with my family in building its future. So I say to you all-watch this space.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze locked on the cameras, narrowing slightly,sharp as an eagle&#39;s strike, as though she could pierce the cold lens and face the unseen figure behind it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, images rose in painful succession-her father&#39;s weary figure, her mother&#39;s shattered mind,her brother forced to carry the family&#39;s burdens, her own years of mistreatment under the Willis couple,and above all, the shadowy culprit who had taken her years ago and wrecked her family. That unseen hand had toppled their joy overnight and dragged them into ruin step by step. A frost gathered in Verena&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She vowed silently-never again would they escape justice. Her final words, meant for the camera, were more than a promise; they were a gauntlet thrown at the feet of the hidden foe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Applause rippled again, followed by murmurs spreading through the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Such a young woman, yet so composed,&#34; a middle-aged man marveled. &#34;To speak with such ambition before a sea of elites-her future shines bright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Humph!&#34; an older man scoffed, his tone sharp with disdain. &#34;A girl so green imagines business is child&#39;s play? The marketplace is a battlefield; words alone won&#39;t win the war.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person beside him gave a small nod, tacitly agreeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opinions diverged: some expectant, some doubtful,others indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Sherwood sat quietly amid the throng,his eyes fastened on Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he heard her say,&#34;watch this space&#34;, his gaze narrowed, and a faint smile touched his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the voices in the hall swelled, Luis lifted his wrist with leisurely grace. The movement seemed casual, yet it bore the unspoken weight of command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, the room hushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweeping his gaze across the crowd, Luis cleared his throat and spoke again, his voice carrying authority.&#34;Though I mentioned this at the press conference,allow me to declare it formally here before the media and our esteemed guests. Alongside our new tech ventures and premium real estate developments, I wvill entrust	the	Sampson	Group&#39;s	Benedict Pharmaceuticals entirely to my sister&#39;s leadership.&#34;</p>
