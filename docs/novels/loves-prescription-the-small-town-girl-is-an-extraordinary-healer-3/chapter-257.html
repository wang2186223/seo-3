                <p>Luis steadied his thoughts, on the verge of agreeing to work with Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, before he could speak, he saw her lower her head without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of doubt crossed his eyes as Verena&#39;s browS tightened and her hand instinctively pressed against her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain struck like a knife from within-sharp,relentless. Sweat sprang to her forehead in an instant, and her head spun as though weighed down by stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah...&#34; Verena gasped, a faint cry of agony escaping her lips. Her legs, suddenly drained of strength, gave way, and she slumped from the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he had no clue what had befallen her, Luis acted without hesitation. He lunged forward,urgency burning through him, and caught Verena just before she struck the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook her lightly, his voice trembling with alarm.&#34;Mrs. Bennett! What&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her eyelids stayed shut. Her complexion had drained of all color, leaving her face ghostly pale, and she gave no answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis dared not delay another second. Gathering her in his arms, he rushed out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, a black car tore through the streets,racing toward the nearest hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hospital, Luis stood outside the emergency room, hands buried deep in his pockets, waiting as time stretched unbearably long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like an eternity, the doctor finally appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis stepped forward at once, his voice calm yet edged with strain. &#34;Doctor, how is the patient inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor&#39;s brows drew tight, his eyes shadowed with reproach. After one glance at Luis, he said firmly, &#34;Your wife is frail, but there&#39;s no need to panic.It&#39;s only low blood sugar. Still, as &#39;her husband, you&#39;ve been careless. She&#39;s pregnant, and you should be taking far better care of her. If matters had turned grave, the consequences would have been severe.You must watch over her more closely in the days ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words stunned Luis. His composure faltered,and embarrassment flickered across his face. &#34;You&#39;re mistaken. I&#39;m not her husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor blinked, momentarily caught off guard,and then cleared his throat and coughed to cover his slip. &#34;Ah, I see... Forgive me for the misunderstanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac arrived in haste the moment he received the hospital&#39;s call. Jacob wheeled him swiftly down the corridor, the chair&#39;s wheels scraping against the floor, their sound echoing through the hushed passage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat clung to Isaac&#39;s brow, whether from the rush or the dread gnawing at his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, voices drifted from the nurses&#39; station-hushed, yet piercing as thunder to his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you hear? That young woman, Verena... she neglected her health, and she&#39;s lost the baby. Such a pity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were soft, but to lsaac they detonated like a cruel thunderclap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart stumbled in his chest, his breath caught and quickened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could no longer restrain himnself and cried out to Jacob,&#34;Faster-push faster!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob gave a sharp nod and increased his pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, they reached the ward. The moment Isaac lifted his eyes, his gaze locked onto a figure he knew too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat on a bench along the corridor, head bowed,features shadowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, Isaac&#39;s fury erupted, flaring hot as wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis Sampson!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was him-without a doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger surged so fiercely that Isaac&#39;s legs quivered of their own accord, straining as if they might rise in defiance of his weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers clawed at the wheelchair&#39;s armrests,knuckles blanching, veins standing out as though every ounce of strength had gathered there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then-his legs shifted, lifting ever so slightly, as if betraying their long helplessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to surge forward, the door  opened. Verena appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac froze, stunned. She stood there, one hand resting protectively over her stomach, a tender smnile softening her face. She looked perfectly well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, relief struck him like a tide. It was as though he had been teetering on a cliff&#39;s edge, only to be pulled back at the final breath. The tension snapped from his body, leaving him to collapse heavily into the wheelchair once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He whispered her name, his gaze shifting from rage to joy and finally to a deep, trembling relief-as if in the span of seconds, he had lived through death and returned to life.</p>
