                <p>Though Verena reached out with all her heart,Marisa remained oblivious, treating her presence as though it were thin air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were vacant, fixed on the pillow clutched in her arms. She murmured again and again, &#34;My little darling,sleep now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried the haze of confusion, yet wrapped in a warmth so deep that the pillow seemed like her pearl of great price-her whole world pressed to her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Verena heard her mother use a name that only the dearest family had ever spoken, it felt as though an invisible hand seized her heart, stealing the air from her lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She caressed Marisa&#39;s time-worn cheek,her own voice breaking even as she tried to keep it tender.&#34;Mom, it&#39;s me. I&#39;m right here. Look at me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Marisa wandered deeper in her muddled realm,deaf to Verena&#39;s plea, her lips moving with the same broken refrain. She tightened her hold on the pillow, instinctive,desperate, as though someone might rob her of her child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s gaze fell on that pillow, and guilt pierced her like a thorn. Had she never been taken away years ago,perhaps her mother would never have fallen to this state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought alone brought tears to her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her head, she drew in a deep breath,summoning the courage to reach carefully for the pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand moved with the patience of one handling glass. As she slowly drew the pillow away, her eyes never left Marisa&#39;s. Her voice was soft, almost a whisper. &#34;Mom, this isn&#39;t your baby. I&#39;m here-I&#39;m your daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she even began to pull it free,dread gnawed at her-would Marisa clutch it back with all her strength?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She feared her mother&#39;s grief might only deepen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, to her astonishment, Marisa did not resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her vacant eyes shifted from the pillow to Verena&#39;s face. Slowly, faint light kindled there. Marisa stared, dazed, before whispering in a hoarse tone, &#34;Are you my daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had not expected such swift belief. She seized Marisa&#39;s hand with all her strength, her voicethick with tears. &#34;Mom, it&#39;s me. I&#39;m your daughter. I&#39;ve come back-and I&#39;ll never leave you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Marisa&#39;s anxiety broke loose.Summoning a strength born of longing, she pulled Verena into an embrace so fierce it nearly crushed the breath from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena did not resist. Though suffocated,she only tightened her own hold in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marisa buried her face in her daughter&#39;s shoulder,trembling,sobbing low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst her tears came anguished words, heavy with guilt. &#34;I&#39;m sorry... I&#39;m sorry... It&#39;s all my fault. I failed to protect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She repeated the lament like a prisoner caught in a cycle with no escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each word was a hammer upon Verena&#39;s heart,leaving it bruised and aching. Tears broke loose as she cried with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stroked her mother&#39;s back, comforting her gently  through sobs. &#34;Mom, it isn&#39;t your fault. Don&#39;t carry that burden. I&#39;m here now-and nothing will part us again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under her comfort, Marisa&#39;s sobs began to fade, her body still quivering but slowly loosening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, as if some hidden switch had been touched,another thought seized her. Her brow furrowed,and she gestured wildly, muttering, &#34;The gifts...I&#39;ve saved so many special gifts, all for your birthdays. I&#39;ll show you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice brimmed with urgency. Breaking from Verena&#39;s arms, she staggered toward the cabinet in the corner, still murmuring, &#34;The gifts... the gifts...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With trembling hands, Marisa rummaged, scattering items without care, driven only by the search for the treasures she had prepared for her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no matter how she searched, nothing appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion clouded her face, and desperation surged in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her knees gave way, and she collapsed with a cry like that of a lost child. &#34;What do I do? The gifts are gone -I can&#39;t find them. What do I do? They were for my daughter...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena rushed to her side, her arms reaching out to  steady her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Marisa thrashed, hands flailing, despair twisting her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rose again, trying to continue the hopeless search.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena caught her hands firmly, drawing her back into an embrace, her voice both urgent and soothing.&#34;Mom, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ve already received the gifts.Truly,I have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words rooted Marisa in place. She froze,looking at Verena with trembling doubt. &#34;You...you received them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena brushed away her mother&#39;s tears with her thumb, her gaze brimming with tenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning close, she nodded softly, eyes steady.&#34;Yes,I&#39;ve received them-and I treasure them dearly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sincerity washed over Marisa,calming her storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had once believed that blood ties alone could not bridge the gulf of years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet in this moment, she felt how deeply her parents had always held her in their hearts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The distance she feared had melted away. Marisa&#39;s sobs grew faint,though a few hiccupped cries lingered in the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The long storm left her utterly drained, her eyes swollen,her face dazed with weariness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena tended to her gently, as though afraid a careless touch might cause pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She eased her mother back onto the bed. Marisa clutched her daughter&#39;s hand with desperate strength,as if letting go would mean losing her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena did not resist. She let her mother hold on with all her might.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting at her side, she smoothed the strands of hair from Marisa&#39;s face, speaking softly. &#34;Rest now. It&#39;s all behind us. Everything is alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guided by that tender voice, Marisa&#39;s breath slowed,her grip weakened, and sleep drew her under at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Verena left the room, her own heart was steadier, as though a burden had finally been lifted.</p>
