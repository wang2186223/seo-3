                <p>A sudden shift appeared in Isaac&#39;s expression, his brows drawing together in concern. &#34;What did you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob kept his gaze low, offering no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a moment to steady himself, Isaac told the room, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but we&#39;ll have to end this meeting here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then turned to Jacob with urgency. &#34;Get the car ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he maneuvered his wheelchair quickly out of the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Wendell and Isaac reached the police station at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they arrived, officers separated them, guiding each into a different interrogation room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon entering, Wendell spotted two police officers waiting at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having never experienced such an ordeal, he found himself growing nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Professor Branson, please have a seat.&#34; Waldo motioned toward the chair facing him. &#34;I&#39;m Waldo Collins.You can just call me Officer Collins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell did as he was told and asked hesitantly, &#34;Officer Collins, may I ask why I was summoned here...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo answered plainly, &#34;This concerns Verena Willis and Katelyn Fuller.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell blinked, unsure of the connection. &#34;I&#39;m not sure I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo&#39;s tone grew more intense. &#34;Did Verena ever threaten you or try to make you speak out against Katelyn, denying her identity as Evelyn Rowe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell froze in surprise before shaking his head. &#34;Verena never threatened me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Believing Wendell might be too afraid to speak freely, Waldo attempted to reassure him. &#34;You&#39;re safe here,and we&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re protected. Don&#39;t hesitate, just tell us the truth about what happened.&#34; Wendell answered firmly, &#34;Verena is my friend, and she would never threaten me. The one who pressured me was Katelyn Fuller, trying to prove she&#39;s Evelyn Rowe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of surprise lit up Waldo&#39;s face. Was Verena actually telling the truth?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he wanted to be certain, so he pressed on, &#34;But you once said that Katelyn was your associate during your time in Clokron. Why do you say now that she threatened you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell&#39;s discomfort was obvious as soon as Katelyn&#39;s name came up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He replied, &#34;I only said that because Katelyn used threats against my family. She made me lie for her. She isn&#39;t Evelyn; the real Evelyn is Verena. My acquaintance with Katelyn barely goes back a month, but I&#39;ve known Verena for almost three years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo leaned forward and asked, &#34;Do you have any proof to support what you&#39;re saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Wendell rubbed his temple and offered his phone to Waldo. &#34;You can look through my chat history with Katelyn. We only exchanged contact details recently. If we were really partners in Clokron, there would be no reason for us to add each other on the chat app just a few days ago. Also, if you notice,almost every conversation was started by her. Even with calls, she always dialed my number first. If we had been close for years, the communication would go both ways.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief silence, he continued, &#34;If that isn&#39;t convincing enough, you can look at the surveillance footage.Our first meeting took place at a well-known spot, Fortune Garden Restaurant. I had never laid eyes on her before that day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo paid attention as he checked both the messages and the call logs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything Wendell said matched up: Katelyn always reached out first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their chats were short and to the point, mostly arranging where to meet, and her tone came across as distant, nothing like the way real friends or work associates would speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo returned the phone to Wendell and asked, &#34;So, the people stationed at your home...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They were arranged by Verena. She was worried that Katelyn might try to hurt me or my family, so she set up protection.&#34; Wendell&#39;s voice was steady. &#34;Officer Collins, Verena really is Evelyn, and I count her as a true friend. If you still have doubts, you can pull my call history with Verena. Even though she uses different numbers, you can trace the owners. Also, when she came back from overseas, we had a meal at Fortune Garden Restaurant, too. There&#39;s surveillance footage that will confirm I met Verena much earlier than I ever knew Katelyn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo glanced at the officer taking notes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick nod, the officer turned to the computer, and soon a video from the surveillance system played on the monitor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the footage, Waldo saw clear proof: Wendell had met with Verena long before he ever saw Katelyn, and the time gap between those meetings was obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small frown settled on Waldo&#39;s face. He realized that what he was uncovering was not at all what he had expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a quiet sigh, rose from his seat, and told Wendell, &#34;Thank you for answering our questions,Professor Branson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face stayed unreadable,giving Wendell no clue where he stood. Rising to his feet,Wendell extended his hand and said politely, &#34;Thank you for your efforts, Officer Collins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Wendell had gone, Waldo stepped into the other interrogation room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the door opened, Isaac glanced up to see who entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo asked, &#34;You must be Mr. Isaac Bennett?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the name badge on his chest, Isaac nodded. &#34;Yes, Officer Collins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Waldo stepped closer, he noticed Isaac sat in a wheelchair rather than an ordinary chair, and for a brief moment,sympathy flickered in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regaining his composure, Waldo took the seat across from Isaac, preparing to begin the interview, but lsaac spoke first. &#34;Officer, can you tell me what&#39;s happened to my wife? Where is she right now?&#34; He had tried to reach Verena several times on the way to the station, each time without success, and worry was etched on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Isaac&#39;s concern, Waldo answered, &#34;There&#39;s no need to worry, Mr. Bennett. Mrs. Bennett is in a waiting area. After we finish here, you&#39;ll be able to see her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bit of tension left Isaac&#39;s shoulders after hearing that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a nod and said, &#34;Of course, Officer Collins. Go ahead with your questions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo&#39;s first question was straightforward. &#34;Are you aware that Katelyn Fuller has been attacked?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of confusion crossed Isaac&#39;s face. &#34;When did this happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo answered, &#34;On the morning of December 1st, it was at the second intersection on Wood Street. But the surveillance cameras there had been intentionally destroyed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gave a sight shake of his head. &#34;I didn&#39;t know about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo rested his hands on the table and met Isaac&#39;s eyes, and from his look, Isaac didn&#39;t appear to be lying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, and then shifted the conversation. &#34;Mr. Bennett, did your wife ever ask you to arrange surveillance over Wendell&#39;s family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac squinted slightly, sensing something off in what he had just heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave his head a small shake and corrected. &#34;It wasn&#39;t surveillance. It was protection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning confusion, Waldo furrowed his brow. &#34;Is that so? What makes you say that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With steady composure, Isaac explained, &#34;Katelyn threatened Wendell&#39;s family so he would claim she was Evelyn Rowe, just to convince my mother she was the right surgeon. Still, my wife and I refused her offer.Later, my wvife talked to Wendell and confirmed he had been pressured by Katelyn. That&#39;s when she asked me to ensure his family was safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo listened, deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So far, Isaac&#39;s, Wendell&#39;s, and Verena&#39;s stories all lined up. Could Katelyn have orchestrated the entire situation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo held back from making any conclusions since there was nothing solid to prove Verena had hired hitmen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few seconds of silence, he stood and told Isaac, &#34;Thank you for your help, Mr. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac nodded and shook Waldo&#39;s hand in return.</p>
