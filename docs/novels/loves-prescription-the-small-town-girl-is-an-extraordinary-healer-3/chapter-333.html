                <p>Miranda&#39;s vague reply slipped under Luis&#39; skin, pulling at emotions he thought he had buried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight crease formed between his brows as his mind drifted back to the memory of their very first encounter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had traveled to Clokron back then, attending a lavish corporate party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ballroom sparkled under crystal chandeliers, with guests clinking glasses and trading polite laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the event began winding down, Luis,buzzed from too much wine, decided to retreat to his suite for some rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway down the corridor, he crossed paths with a woman approaching from the opposite side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her silhouette alone commanded attention, the sleek gown hugging her waist and drawing the eye to her long,elegant legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each step made the waves of her hair bounce lightly against her shoulders, a picture of quiet grace. Luis had already noticed her earlier that evening,when someone pointed her out to him-Miranda Brown, CEO of AuroraNexus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following that introduction, his gaze had lingered on her more than once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a glass of wine in hand, she had stood among a group, laughing brightly, her gestures animated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile lit her face, eyes sparkling with confidence,every tilt of her head drawing attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rose-red dress she wore had only made her shine brighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just her beauty that struck Luis, though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What captivated him most was the fact that she had claimed the role of CEO at such a young age,building AuroraNexus into something formidable before most people her age had even found their footing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Climbing to the top of the corporate ladder at such a young age, and steering a company ranked among the world&#39;s elite,was nothing short of extraordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wanting to be polite, Luis slowed his steps, ready to offer her a courteous greeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what happened next caught him completely off  guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s stride wavered, and she stumbled slightly toward him, her cheeks tinted with a rosy flush and her eyes hazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could steady her, her hand darted out and seized his tie, tugging with a boldness that was both playful and provocative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unexpected pull made him lean forward,dragged by the force of her grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned in close, her breath tinged with wine as her sultry voice slipped between them. &#34;Mr. Sampson,I&#39;ve been watching you for a while. Stay with me tonight,won&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; first instinct had been to step back, but the lilt of her voice and the gleam in her eyes left him unmoored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was the alcohol clouding his head or the allure of her gaze, he let himself falter, falling into her spell far too easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was how it all began-the very first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, as her tempting words echoed in his memory, Luis recognized with a jolt that he was standing on the edge of the same mistake, seconds away from being ensnared again. When Verena had mentioned Miranda would reach out to another man if he didn&#39;t show up, a pang of inexplicable irritation had struck deep, tightening something inside his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It caused him to make mistakes in meetings and hurry to the hotel once he left work in the evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he walked into the room, his eyes had darted nervously around, searching without even realizing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking back on it, every awkward move he had made seemed almost ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis mocked himself silently-because to Miranda, he had been nothing more than a fleeting distraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smoke curled from the end of Luis&#39; cigarette as he drew in deeply, his chest rising and falling in steady rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Miranda reclined against the pillows,her eyes studying him with a mix of curiosity and amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the silence stretched on too long, she parted her lips to press him for an answer-only for Luis to snuff out the cigarette and flick it into the ashtray with finality. He rose to his full height and cut a striking figure as he crossed the space between them, his steps slow and deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He halted right before her, his stare locked onto hers while his hand tugged at the edge of her robe,exposing the curve of her body with calculated precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips lifted into a confident smile; she was certain she had him where she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of surrender, Luis leaned close,his breath warm against her skin as he spoke in a low, deliberate tone. &#34;Yes, Sampson Group intends to expand abroad.But money isn&#39;t our problem. So do yourself a favor,Miss Brown, and drop that idea. I am still the head of Sampson Group, and I won&#39;t be bought into your bed for business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of becoming one of her casual flings filled him with raw anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Luis turned sharply and strode toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him leave, Miranda&#39;s smile flickered, and then stretched wider before it spilled into unrestrained laughter that echoed through the empty suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how carefully he tried to shield himself , she  had seen it-the faint shift in his eyes when she toyed with the words &#34;sexual partner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that instant forward, Luis had been trying to hold back his irritation, and his reaction thrilled Miranda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of satisfaction lit inside her-winning him might take time, but it was far from impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes slid toward the door, the faint arch of her brows revealing amusement and intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis was a puzzle she meant to solve, a prize she fully intended to claim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, men were best kept dangling, always chasing,never certain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And of course, she would never admit to him that he was the only man she had ever allowed close enough to touch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s journey to Ochrerayd was planned with purpose rather than haste. Suspecting Sherwood of betrayal,she knew she had to move decisively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing breakfast with her parents, she gathered her things and stepped outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The family driver already had the car waiting at the  curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she slid into the back seat, she instructed, &#34;Take me to Benedict Pharmaceuticals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a polite nod, the driver answered, &#34;Yes, ma&#39;am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two days earlier, the announcement of her appointment at Benedict Pharmaceuticals had spread in the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today marked her first official appearance, and anticipation buzzed through the company halls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Employees clustered in small groups, trading observations and hushed theories while trying to make sense of what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A group of young employees gathered in the break room,their voices low with curiosity and speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard Mr. Sampson&#39;s giving his new sister full control of the company. Imnagine landing a position like that. Why can&#39;t fortune ever smile on me like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No kidding. And isn&#39;t she supposed to be around our age?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s hope she actually knows what she&#39;s doing. If she fails, it&#39;s our jobs on the line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;ll have to prove herself fast. The veterans here  won&#39;t make it easy, especially with Molly keeping watch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t matter. We should just mind our own work.What the higher-ups do isn&#39;t for us to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chatter carried on, unchecked, and no one noticed footsteps pause outside the break room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly had overheard enough. Without a word, she straightened her posture and continued briskly down the corridor.</p>
