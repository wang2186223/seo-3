                <p>Katelyn stood frozen, stunned by lsaac&#39;s reply. A heartbeat later, tears broke free as she let out a jagged laugh, her voice trembling. &#34;So this is what l mean to you? A decade of love tossed aside with one heartless line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cold dismissal snuffed out the last spark of hope within her. What remained in her eyes was nothing but bitter hatred, glistening beneath her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could collapse into sobs, she spun on her heel and fled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac never so much as spared her a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy stillness settled over the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica turned her eyes on him. His stare stayed fixed straight ahead, sharp and unwavering,filled with stern determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica hadn&#39;t expected his earlier words to strike her so deeply. From where she stood, it was clear that Katelyn&#39;s love for him was real. Her approach might have been excessive at times, but there was no doubting the sincerity behind her devotion. Danica had  assumed that even if Isaac didn&#39;t return Katelyn&#39;s feelings, he would at least hold a measure of sympathy for her after all those years of commitment.Yet, to her surprise, he remained distant and cold, his response as blunt as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her emotions tangled into knots. She simmered with anger over his blind loyalty to Verena, yet uncertainty clouded her thoughts about how to navigate the mess with Katelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out a weary sigh, she walked out without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Danica left the room, Isaac instructed Rhonda to have the master bedroom cleared and every item replaced by the next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than stay there, he retreated into the study for the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted no reminder of Katelyn left in his space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until every trace of her was erased, he refused to step inside that bedroom again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He powered up the computer and turned to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Bobby&#39;s earlier revelation drifted back into his thoughts-Verena had been the first to uncover the conspiracy plotted by Katelyn and Kaia. That memory brought a faint curve to his lips as he sent her a video call request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, Verena&#39;s poised face appeared on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest tightened as he realized two days had passed since he last saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it all settled?&#34; Verena asked, her smile carrying quiet confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her question was vague, but lsaac needed no further explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nod from him followed. &#34;Katelyn even dragged my mother in to watch everything unravel. Both ended up storming out-Katelyn in tears, and my mom right behind her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold laugh escaped Verena. &#34;Let her deal with the consequences. If Katelyn chooses to play dirty,she ought to accept what comes with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even from across the world, the fact that Verena was keeping watch for his sake left Isaac feeling deeply cared for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gazelingered on her, full of affection. &#34;You&#39;re the reason I saw through their setup, sweetheart. I didn&#39;t let them get to me.&#34; Hearing such sincere words from him for the first time since his memory loss, Verena&#39;s laughter bubbled up,genuine and bright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grew serious, her eyes steady on his. &#34;But we can&#39;t afford to relax. Katelyn&#39;s plans might run deeper than this. Honestly, I doubt a woman with her pride can accept you with your current condition...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Verena caught herself, regret flashing across her face. &#34;Sorry. That wasn&#39;t fair of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her slight frown, Isaac offered gentle reassurance. &#34;Didn&#39;t you promise you&#39;d help me get better? We&#39;re partners-there&#39;s no reason for you to tiptoe around me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Verena had already given him a sense of security and courage. If he still retreated into old insecurities, the problem would lie with him, not her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s happiness was unmistakable when she saw that lsaac wasn&#39;t as fragile as before. She added,&#34;Here&#39;s how I see it: Katelyn&#39;s definitely plotting something else. Back when I was around, she never stopped looking for ways to get you to accept her as your doctor. With me gone, she&#39;s got one less obstacle. It&#39;s hard to believe she&#39;lI just let this chance slip by. Plus, Danica&#39;s opinion of me has soured, so with Katelyn&#39;s influence, your mother could easily be roped into something against you.&#34; Isaac let out a dry chuckle. &#34;So what&#39;s next? Is my mom going to slip me a drug and tie me down sO Katelyn can operate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a knowing smile, Verena simply replied,&#34;Anything&#39;s possible.&#34;</p>
