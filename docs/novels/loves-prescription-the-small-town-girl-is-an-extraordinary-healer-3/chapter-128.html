                <p>That afternoon, Katelyn realized her meeting with Verena was coming up, so she picked out a sleek silver handbag from the closet, dressed herself with meticulous care, and strutted out in her favorite heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She arrived at a cozy restaurant in Shoildon, claimed a corner table, and sent Verena a quick message with her location. &#34;I&#39;m here now. See you soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling in, Katelyn ordered a juice and waited, the picture of composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena responded with a simple, &#34;Okay.&#34; Then she placed her phone aside and continued her work on her laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a reason people trusted a woman&#39;s instincts-they were hardly ever wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Katelyn called earlier, Verena instantly picked up on the underlying tension that this was no friendly invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing that Katelyn had her own agenda, Verena had no intention of playing along easily. Since Katelyn had already arrived, Verena decided to let her wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the restaurant, Katelyn saw Verena&#39;s short response and figured she was on her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A self-satisfied grin formed on Katelyn&#39;s lips. She assumed Isaac&#39;s wife would be easy to deal with.After all, she&#39;d agreed to meet without any hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her confidence soaring, Katelyn locked her phone and slipped it back into her bag, ready for whatever came next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking Verena would walk in any minute, she sat back and watched the door, waiting patiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing almost three glasses of juice, Katelyn grew impatient, and Verena still hadn&#39;t appeared. Her eyes swept the room, but there wasn&#39;t a single familiar face heading in her direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick glance at her phone told Katelyn that nearly an hour had slipped by. Irritation flickered across her features. Apart from Isaac, she&#39;d never waited so long for anyone. If meeting Verena hadn&#39;t been essential, she would have walked out ages ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn pushed down her annoyance and kept scrolling through her feed, doing her best to appear unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Verena closed her laptop with a quiet snap and made her way downstairs, phone in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda greeted her with a polite smile. &#34;Are you heading out, Mrs. Bennett? Should I ask the driver to get the car ready?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena shook her head, her expression light.′′NO need, I&#39;ll drive myself. I won&#39;t be gone long, so there&#39;s really no point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seraphina Villas weren&#39;t far from the restaurant Katelyn picked, so the drive took Verena less than twenty minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside, Verena told a server her name and waited as she was guided through the dining area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The server pointed toward the far side of the room with a welcoming smile. &#34;Ma&#39;am, your table is over on the right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave a nod of appreciation. &#34;Thank you,I see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, the server offered a small bow and hurried off to her next task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning toward the spot the server indicated,Verena spotted an empty table with just a single glass set out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, another server approached with a new glass of juice, while a young woman, her attention fixed on her phone, hurried right into the server&#39;s path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their paths collided, causing the server to lose balance and splash juice onto the woman&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick apology came from the server. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fumbled for a napkin, reaching out to help clean the spill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman sidestepped the gesture, snatching a napkin herself to wipe her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glance down confirmed Katelyn&#39;s outfit was unscathed, much to her relief, especially since the clothes were a rare, limited edition piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance from her long wait for Verena now bubbled up over this small accident. She shot the server a cold glare. &#34;Could you try being more careful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The server&#39;s cheeks turned crimson as she murmured another apology. &#34;I&#39;m truly sorry, I&#39;ll bring you a replacement right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unimpressed, Katelyn waved her off. &#34;Forget it. Just get back to your work.&#34; Visibly grateful, the server bowed several more times before retreating.</p>
