                <p>Sherwood had first harbored doubts about what Henson said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet when the evidence was laid before him, his innate skepticism leapt up like a spark in dry grass, and unease slithered into his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, years in the meciless battlefield of business had trained his face into stone; his turmoil was hidden deep, showing only in the taut line of his jaw. That single tightening betrayed the storm raging within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his head, his eyes sharp as an eagle cutting across the sky, fixingon Henson. His voice now carried a frost that chilled the air. &#34;Very well, I understand.Your loyalty still stands acknowledged. As for this matter,I will investigate it thoroughly. You may go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flick of his hand dismissed Henson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henson gave a small nod, his face composed in dutiful respect, though inside he rejoiced quietly-part of his aim had already taken root. With measured steps, he withdrew, shutting the office door as if sealing away secrets. Alone in the office,Sherwood sank back into his chair.Silence pressed down heavily, punctuated only by the steady tick of the wall clock, as though time itself counted toward a reckoning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze darkened; the pen in his grip had bent beneath the strain of his clenched fist,its cap rapping against the desk like a drum of war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He narrowed his eyes. Howe had been beside him for years,privy to every shadow-unethical maneuvers in the marketplace, hidden dealings with forces better left unnamed. If Howe truly turned his back and revealed those secrets, Sherwood&#39;s empire,painstakingly built brick by brick, could crumble in a single night. That could not-must not-happen.Better to be overly cautious than to let danger grow unseen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing the pen aside, Sherwood folded his arms over his chest,leaning back with deliberate calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze hardened, resolve crystallizing; the thought of removing Howe sank like an anchor, pulling deeper by the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so, plans began to weave in his mind-how to erase Howe with ruthless discretion, how to leave no trace,no whisper, while securing his own safety above all. ...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a restaurant&#39;s VIP room in Ochrerayd, Isaac sat at the head of the table, posture straight, a quiet storm of authority radiating from him. His long lashes shadowed his eyes, masking the currents of thought beneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from him, Howe hunched slightly, unease etched into his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That morning, scarcely had he stepped out of his door when two silent giants seized his arms and bundled him into a car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, faced with Isaac in this room, dread gnawed at him over what command might follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to soften the air, Howe spoke first, a note of flattery lacing his tone. &#34;Mr. Bennett, I&#39;ve done exactly as you ordered. Sherwood hasn&#39;t suspected a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gave no answer, his expression cool as still water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silence stretched-then his gaze lifted, cutting directly to Howe&#39;s face. His lips parted slowly. &#34;If I&#39;m not mistaken, Sherwood is already scheming how to rid himself of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words froze Howe; shock flashed in his eyes. It took him a long breath to recover, straightening quickly as he protested, &#34;Mr. Bennett,please-don&#39;t try to sow discord! I&#39;ve stood by Sherwood for years.How could he possibly...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Isaac lifted a hand,his long fingers tapping the table with lazy precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he slid forward the forged video and transaction record.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe glanced down-and his eyes widened in horror.&#34;What...what is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at the footage and the document as if they were snakes. He had never met Verena, nor had his wife seen such a sum!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac,legs crossed and chin tucked,regarded him with a gaze heavy and crushing. &#34;You&#39;re not mistaken. 1forged these and had someone hand them to Sherwood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips curved into a thin smile, cold enough to bite.&#34;Knowing Sherwood&#39;s suspicious nature, do you think he&#39;lI still trust you once these take root in his mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe&#39;s heart sank. A chill crept up his spine as panic flickered in his eyes. He knew Sherwood well: suspicion was his constant companion. Once doubt took hold, Howe&#39;s days were numbered.With Sherwood&#39;s ruthless hand, elimination would not take long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought sent shivers racing from his soles to his scalp,his body trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Bennett,&#34; Howe rasped, his voice strained, &#34;what is it you want from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have no choice but to obey,&#34; Isaac said calmly,fingers interlaced as he leaned forward. &#34;Work with me openly. Reveal everything Sherwood has done against the Sampson family-leave nothing hidden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone chilled further. &#34;Of course, you can refuse.But remember this: Sherwood already doubts you.Once he acts, your power will be stripped without mercy.And the more you know of his secrets, the more dangerous you become in his eyes. Should he strike, your wife will not be spared. Neither of you will escape.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe&#39;s hand clawed at his hair; his jaw twitched as panic,hesitation, and rage warred within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long silence, he suddenly shot upright, eyes wild.&#34;But I&#39;ve stood with Sherwood in so many acts against the Sampson family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Veins throbbed on his temples as he shouted, voice breaking. &#34;If Luis learns the truth, how could he ever forgive me? Wouldn&#39;t I be facing certain death?&#34; Biting his lip hard, he drew a shaky breath before mustering the courage to say, &#34;Mr. Bennett,forgive me-but I cannot agree to your request.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac did not flare with anger as Howe expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he sat back, calm as ever, the faintest smile on his lips-though it never touched his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning slightly, he signaled to his aide with a soft command. &#34;Escort Mr. Adams out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe blinked in surprise. He had braced for coercion,threats, or endless persuasion-yet Isaac released him with such ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a stunned pause, Howe quickly rose, gave a small bow, and left in haste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the door closed, Jacob frowned, glancing at Isaac.&#34;Mr.Bennett,it seems Howve won&#39;t bend so easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac leaned back, shaking his head, his voice rich yet steady. &#34;Human nature seeks to weigh gain against loss. Unless danger presses hard against their throat,they&#39;ll never risk it all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze shifted to the bustling street outside,thoughtful. &#34;Keep watch-if Sherwood makes a move against Howe, we&#39;ll fan the flames until the fire roars higher. But under no condition should Howe be  He carries Sherwood&#39;s secrets, and they&#39;re key to our plans.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Sherwood, Isaac frowned,impatience flickering. &#34;Luis is such an obstacle-entangled in trifles, slow to act, hesitant at every step.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob nodded, a hint of knowing humor on his lips.&#34;And is that why you push yourself daily, handling everything at once, just to carve out time to aid Mrs.Bennett with her burdens?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Verena&#39;s name was spoken, Isaac&#39;s sternness melted. A smile curved his lips, and warmth lit his eyes. &#34;Naturally. I cherish my own wife. She has given so much to me and our family. The least I can do is shoulder these storms for her.&#34;</p>
