                <p>The villa district wasn&#39;t packed with cars, but the streets split off in every direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena pressed harder on the accelerator and guided the wheel through turn after turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby kept his eyes on her car as it slipped smoothly through each curve. He could tell she&#39;d already spotted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was almost gone from view. His foot hovered over the gas, but he hesitated. That severe crash had scarred their family, and he couldn&#39;t risk repeating the past. Still, if he stayed cautious,the perfect woman for his brother would get away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That tug-of-war in his head cost him precious seconds. By the time he realized it, her car had vanished, and he&#39;d steered straight onto a blocked-off road under construction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it!&#34; he exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over at Willis Villa, the party buzzed with chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaia, the clock&#39;s ticking. Shouldn&#39;t you already be up there kicking off the party?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, didn&#39;t you promise you&#39;d choose a partner for the opening dance once things got started? We&#39;re dying to find out who the mystery man is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s friends&#39; voices carried a playful urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew she should be on stage, but Bobby still hadn&#39;t shown up. She wanted everyone to see that he&#39;d made the effort to come for her birthday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping her tone light, she said, &#34;Just a little longer. There&#39;s one guest I&#39;m still waiting for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her friends exchanged curious glances. &#34;Who could possibly be that important?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warm flush spread across Kaia&#39;s cheeks. One of them grinned knowingly. &#34;Oh, I see that blush. Don&#39;t tell me this &#39;guest&#39; is more than just a casual acquaintance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Kaia&#39;s heart agreed, but she kept her smile composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned closer to the young woman who just spoke and deliberately said in a hushed but teasing voice,&#34;Don&#39;t spread such rumors. That guest is Bobby Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hung in the air for a beat before gasps and raised brows broke the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously? Bobby&#39;s actually coming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,did I hear you right? Bobby never shows up to birthday parties unless it&#39;s for Slater.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaia, just spill it. What&#39;s going on between you two?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cluster of women watched her with eager eyes, their curiosity as obvious as their envy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, Kaia heard Bobby&#39;s voice again, praising her for her kindness. She had never been certain about his feelings, but the way her friends were talking planted a hopeful thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Men liked gentle, genuine women. Bobby wasn&#39;t one to fake his words. That had to mean something...right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face warmed, the heat creeping into her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thirty minutes had slipped by, yet there was still no sign of Bobby anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same women who had envied her earlier now leaned close to whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Strange. She was so sure Bobby wouuld be here, but it&#39;s been forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think he ditched her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh, lower your voice before she hears.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia was standing close enough to catch every word. The anticipation she&#39;d carried all evening curled into embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers tightened around her glass. Pushing down the sting, she moved gracefully from guest to guest, raising her glass with the same practiced smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One gulp drained her wine. With her smile stilI fixed, she slipped onto the balcony and pulled out her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Bobby remained stranded on that half-finished road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place was nearly deserted, and the darkness only made it harder to find his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby finally called for someone to pick him up. But before he could even pocket his phone, it lit up with another call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Bobby could even say hello, an urgent voice rushed through the line. &#34;Mr. Bennett, the party&#39;s starting any minute. When can we expect you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting the chance to meet the woman he thought could be the perfect sister-in-law should have been a win, yet he&#39;d ended up chasing her straight onto a road closed for repairs. Losing sight of her and winding up lost had already soured his mood, and now Kaia&#39;s call pressed him for answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t be making it,&#34; he said sharply. &#34;If you still want to move ahead with the plan against Verena,have Slater take over. Call him yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To anyone looking in from the outside, Bobby and Slater were nearly inseparable. So when Bobby had agreed to show up for Kaia&#39;s birthday, Slater had casually decided to go too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach dropped at his words. Was he really bailing? After she&#39;d told everyone he was coming? The thought of facing the guests now made her skin prickle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia fought to keep her temper in check and spoke in a calm tone. &#34;Mr. Bennett, is there something pressing that&#39;s holding you up? We made an agreement to work side by side, yet the plan hasn&#39;t even begun and now you&#39;re pulling away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than explain, Bobby ended the call without another word, unwilling to waste more time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flat tone on the line made Kaia&#39;s grip on her phone tighten. Heat rose to her face and her breathing grew uneven, the sting of frustration sharp in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she forced herself to remember the bigger picture-Verena&#39;s wedding to Isaac needed to be stopped, and that mattered more than her pride right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing the anger down, she pulled up Slater&#39;s contact and hit call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call went through without delay, and Kaia spoke without preamble. &#34;Hi, Slater, this is Kaia. Are you around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, his familiarity with her was minimal. Most of what he knew came from Bobby, and nothing in those accounts made her seem like someone he could fully trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater had never approved of Kaia, yet politeness kept his tone steady as he said, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Miss Willis.My grandfather suddenly fell ill, and I need to stay with himn. I can&#39;t leave right now, but I&#39;ll make sure someone delivers a gift on my behalf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, receiving a gift from someone of Slater&#39;s influence would have been enough to make Kaia&#39;s evening. Tonight, however, was about more than her birthday-it was the perfect chance to deal with Verena, and his absence was a blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I understand,&#34; she replied, though the stiffness in her voice betrayed her disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended, and her jaw tightened. So muchfor help-at the moment she needed allies the most, they all had somewhere else to be. Looked like she&#39;d have to handle this herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking the stairs two at a time, she headed for the last room at the far end of the third-floor hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her knuckles rapped against the door, and her voice carried through it. &#34;Verena, it&#39;s me. The party&#39;s started -come downstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single word came back to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A twinge of unease crept in. She twisted the handle and stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quiet inside the room felt heavy. She called Verena&#39;s name again as she crossed the space, but the silence stayed unbroken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though part of her already suspected the truth, she moved methodically, unwilling to overlook even the smallest hiding place. The bathroom was empty. So was the wardrobe. Not a single sign of anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hands curling into fists, she turned to leave, spotting a servant walking past in the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you seen Verena?&#34; she asked sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant shook her head. &#34;No, Miss.I haven&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s temper flared. Not seen Verena? As if she could simply vanish without notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia wondered when Verena had left and how she had missed it.</p>
