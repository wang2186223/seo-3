                <p>Once she heard Isaac&#39;s answer, Verena opened the door and stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she entered, Isaac came into view,completely absorbed in his work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat with his back straight and head lowered, giving all his attention to the paperwork spread across his desk. The set of his jaw and his serious expression made him look unapproachable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunlight poured through the window, casting a warm glow over his sharp features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brow was knitted in concentration, lips pressed into a firm line, radiating a sense of unwavering resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stood quietly, her eyes resting on him with a mix of affection and admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a short pause, she crossed the room and stopped at the edge of his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac noticed movement in his peripheral vision and,assuming it was Jacob coming with an update, asked without looking up, &#34;What is it?&#34; The only reply was silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac paused, a trace of impatience crossing his face,and spoke again. &#34;I&#39;m waiting for your answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, no one responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused and a little frustrated, Isaac finally lifted his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when his eyes landed on Verena, all irritation faded and the world seemed to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Isaac could hardly believe she was really standing there, not just a voice on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lit up with happiness, shining as brightly as stars on a clear night, and Verena couldn&#39;t help but notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With warmth in his voice, lsaac asked, &#34;What brings you here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena answered with a radiant smile, &#34;I thought it was my turn to pick up my husband for once. It wouldn&#39;t be fair if you always did the honors, would it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped closer, looped her arms around his neck,and grinned. &#34;Surprise! I hope you like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words came out light and cheerful, brightening the room like a chime in the breeze. A wave of happiness rushed through Isaac, his eyes lighting up with pure delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat, trying to sound casual. &#34;Actually,I still have a bit of work left to finish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s smile softened as she replied in a low voice,&#34;That&#39;s alright. I&#39;ll be right here until you&#39;re done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She curled up close, wrapping her arms around his neck in a gentle, affectionate embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The space between them disappeared, their breath mixing,bodies pressed together. Isaac&#39;s posture went rigid for a moment, though he tried to keep his attention on his paperwork. Still, his thoughts kept drifting back to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft brush of Verena&#39;s hair grazed his cheek,sending a faint tickle across his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gentle scent floated all around him, drawing him in and making it impossible to focus. The feeling was both comforting and irresistible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes slipped by as lsaac lost himself in the moment, forgetting all about his documents, which sat untouched on the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing how easily he was distracted, Verena let out a playful laugh and said, &#34;You&#39;ve been staring at the  same page for ten minutes, Mr. Bennett. I think your productivity might need some work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color rushed to Isaac&#39;s ears, and he quickly flipped to the next page to hide his embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena caught the flush on his face and grinned,delighted by the effect she had on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A playful spark lit up in her eyes as she said,&#34;Why don&#39;t we play a little game?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac glanced up from his papers. &#34;What kind of game do you have in mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grin turned sly, making her look every bit the fox.&#34;What if we try something daring right here in your office?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words caught lsaac completely off guard, and color immediately flooded his cheeks. His heart raced at the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena let out a giggle, leaning in to whisper, &#34;Relax,I&#39;m only teasing you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started to pull away, but lsaac reached out, his grip firm around her wrist as if he couldn&#39;t let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could move, he drew her close and pressed a deep kiss to her lips. The world outside faded away, leaving only therush of warmth and the rapid beat of their hearts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening her eyes, Verena was met with the burning intensity in Isaac&#39;s gaze, so different from his earlier gentle shyness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her hesitation, Isaac pulled her even closer and kissed her with even more longing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena let out a quiet gasp, and then eagerly responded, matching his energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel his breath, hot and rapid, brushing against her skin and sending shivers across her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s hands trailed down, fingers quickly undoing each button of her blouse with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the last one came undone, Verena snapped back, grabbing his hand to stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks turned pink as she quickly reminded him,&#34;Don&#39;t forget,I&#39;m pregnant.We really can&#39;tright now...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she spoke, lsaac froze. A slow breath escaped him, and a longing settled in his eyes. He leaned into her, nuzzling her neck like a child looking for comfort. &#34;What am I supposed to do? I&#39;m suddenly not sure I even want kids anymore,&#34; he whispered. His hair was slightly tousled, brushing her skin, giving him a vulnerable and lovable look. Verena ran her hand through his hair, somewhere between laughter and disbelief. &#34;Honestly, you make such a hilarious dad.&#34;</p>
