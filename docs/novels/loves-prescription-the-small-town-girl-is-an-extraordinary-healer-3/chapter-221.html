                <p>As night descended and the city lights flickered on, Verena finally stirred from her slumber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost by instinct, she tried to stretch, only to find her arm blocked by something firm-an anchor in the vast tapestry of shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blinking awake, she discovered she had been sitting on Isaac&#39;s lap, nestled within his embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her eyes opened, Isaac folded the newspaper he had already read several times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What time is it now?&#34; Verena&#39;s voice was slightly hoarse, a labyrinth of lingering tears and sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac glanced at his phone.&#34;Three minutes past eight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adjusting herself to sit straighter, Verena recalled returning home around six. It struck her that she had drifted into sleep for nearly two hours, time slipping away like sand between fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking on it, she lowered her gaze to the snug blanket around her, and then looked back at lsaac.&#34;HOW could you hold me for so long? Aren&#39;t your arms tired?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused mid-movement, his tone soft but resolute. &#34;You were asleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding his reluctance to wake her, Verena felt her heart soften, as though tenderness could transcend sorrow. The ache of Shawna&#39;s murder was soothed a lot by his gentleness. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you.wake me to sleep in the bed?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You looked so peaceful. I hadn&#39;t the heart to disturb you,&#34; Isaac replied, his eyes deep pools of unspoken affection.His voice, low and tender, orchestrated the moment. &#34;Besides, I like holding you like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Verena teased, a light spark weaving into their intricate exchange. &#34;Then why don&#39;t you hold me al night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered without hesitation,&#34;I&#39;d love nothing more.I could hold you forever.&#34; A bright smile spread slowly across her face at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a master of sweet talk,&#34; she said playfully, her tone dancing like notes in a kaleidoscopic symphony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning forward, she brushed her lips gently against his. &#34;Here&#39;s a reward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes lit instantly, the curve of his lips betraying an inner joy that words could hardly capture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, that kiss was indeed a reward-captivating, enigmatic, and overwhelming. His heart brimmed with excitement, unable to contain the tide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at her with eyes that sparkled like stars, he murmured,′′One isn&#39;t enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he pulled her closer by the waist, kissing her deeply until her lips were left swollen, only then realizing his embrace had been perhaps too fervent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s playful suggestion that Isaac hold her all night was never meant seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, she slid off his lap and sat beside him on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>60</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that brief interlude of affection, reality beckoned, and they returned to the crucible of pressing matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During her sleep, Isaac had held back his questions, but now he could not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena,&#34; he called gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her head with curiosity. &#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face turned serious. &#34;Think carefully. Before Shawna&#39;s tragedy, did anyone abroad know your true background? List them all so we can narrow down the suspects.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena picked up the glass of water, sippoed, and then held it between her palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squinted, delving into memory before confirming, &#34;Before my grandma&#39;s incident, only four people knew:Gavin, Julianna, Miranda, and Ivan. None of them would betray me. No one else was told.&#34; Isaac&#39;s eyes deepened. &#34;They&#39;re allpeople you trust?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; Verena nodded firmly. &#34;Gavin and Julianna are my trusted assistants, even confidants. They&#39;d never harm my grandmother-there&#39;s no motive. Miranda and I are close, but we walk entirely different paths; she wouldn&#39;t benefit from harming my family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then there was Ivan...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac hadn&#39;t expected that the man Verena could never quite forget also knew her identity. His thoughts flickered to the tattoo etched on her chest, and his fingers clenched unconsciously as he asked, &#34;What about lvan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even less likely.&#34; Setting down her glass, Verena spoke with unshaken certainty.&#34;IVan would sacrifice his life for me. Of the four people, he&#39;s the one I trust most.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac studied her silently. The mention of Ivan carried a trust she never extended to any other man.It was etched into her, like initials carved into stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That realization weighed heavily on him, a paradox he could not untangle-a mixture of devotion and jealousy. Yet, he buried it deep. Now was not the hour for envy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t add to Verena&#39;s burdens at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tightened his fists, striving to orchestrate his turmoil into silence. &#34;If only these four knew and you trust them, then perhaps one of them revealed it unknowingly. You should ask if they slipped during conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lowered her gaze, contemplating the suggestion before nodding. &#34;You&#39;re right. I&#39;ll arrange to meet them now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shall I come along?&#34; Isaac offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head. &#34;No. I&#39;ll be back soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she stepped away, phone in hand, dialing quickly. &#34;Julianna, are you free now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,Evelyn,&#34; Julianna responded warmly. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening her car door with one hand, Verena replied, &#34;I need to ask you something in person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julianna knew if Verena wanted to talk face-to-face, it had to be about something important. &#34;Alright, I&#39;m heading out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena smiled faintly. &#34;Good, I&#39;Il send you the address.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After sending it, she called Gavin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelyn, this late? Don&#39;t tell me you want me to take you out for drinks again?&#34; Gavin teased, alluding to the night when she was in a boad mood and ended up having him buy drinks for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fastening her seatbelt, Verena chuckled. &#34;Not this time. It&#39;s important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone shifted instantly. &#34;Then send me the address. I&#39;ll be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Verena said, relieved. Within half an hour, the three sat together in a quiet bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Gavin and Julianna sipped their light drinks, Verena spoke directly. &#34;I called you both because I need to ask something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both leaned in with curiosity as she continued, &#34;While abroad, did either of you ever reveal my true identity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They exchanged a look, and then after pondering, shook their heads. &#34;Absolutely not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julianna spoke first. &#34;Evelyn, I understand the weight of your secret. Since learning it, I&#39;ve guarded it fiercely, always mindful, never careless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin nodded. &#34;At the hospital, you were always Evelyn. Nobody knew more, not your country, not your roots-nothing of the truth.&#34; Their earnestness left Verena momentarily adrift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had shared her background only after trust had been woven into their shared tapestry, believing their discretion a shield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With surveillance, elite guards, and Ivan contolling the hospital&#39;s network, exposure had seemed impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, here they were, in a labyrinth of betrayal with no clear culprit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she pondered, the more the path twisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her troubled brow, Gavin leaned closer. &#34;Evelyn, is something troubling you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julianna studied her intently. &#34;Are you in danger? Let us help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing her eyes, Verena rubbed her temples. &#34;Nothing much, just investigating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of investigation?&#34; Julianna pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena sighed. &#34;About my grandmother&#39;s death.&#34; Gavin pieced it together. &#34;Your enemies murdered her, didn&#39;t they?&#34; Julianna gasped,eyes wide.&#34;Truly?&#34;!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Verena admitted quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can we help?&#34; Gavin asked immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julianna clasped Verena&#39;s hands. &#34;Let us help you find the culprit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena squeezed her back, offering a faint smile. &#34;Thank you,but not now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They understood-her refusal was not out of politeness. Timing mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin nodded. &#34;When you need us, say the word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s smile brightened. &#34;I won&#39;t hold back.&#34; She remembered her promise to lsaac before leaving and didn&#39;t linger. Finishing her glass of water,she rose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Gavin and Julianna offering no leads, only Miranda and Ivan remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Verena immediately ruled out Miranda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda was carefree to a fault; even if she had slipped, she&#39;d never recall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questioning her would be pointless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus,the next morning, Verena arranged to see lvan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crossing his arms, he greeted her with mock severity. &#34;Verena, you owe me an apology. Yesterday you left halfway through our talk and ignored my calls. You&#39;ve got some nerve!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his scolding posture, the youthful defiance in his expression created a paradox of humor and reprimand, leaving the moment strangely amusing.</p>
