                <p>The woman with the bob cut leaned forward,her brows drawn tight. &#34;Mr. Sampson,what&#39;s our next step?We can&#39;t just sit on our hands while Sherwood makes his move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis lowered himself into his chair, lacing his fingers together on the polished table. &#34;Stay calm,&#34; he said evenly. &#34;I&#39;ve already mapped out what we need to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere shifted instantly, the restless whispers dying as every pair of eyes turned his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let a moment stretch before speaking again, his voice carrying quiet authority. &#34;Our first priority is to keep this under wraps. Sherwood must never realize that we&#39;re ahead of him, or he&#39;ll strike out of desperation. Second, we&#39;ll work hand in hand with the police, providing what they need to build the case.And finally, no matter what happens, Sampson Group has to operate without a single hitch. Every project must run as though nothing is amiss, or the outside world will smell weakness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads nodded all around the table, the weight of his words pressing the group into unanimous agreement. The elder gentleman on the left stroked his neatly groomed beard thoughtfully before speaking. &#34;Luis is right. If the company falters even slightly, the vultures outside will circle. Sherwood is just waiting for a crack in our armor. We need to stay steady, let everything move as usual. Not one project can stall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neville leaned in eagerly, his voice firm. &#34;I&#39;ll keep my finger on the pulse of public opinion. If any rumor or smear surfaces, we&#39;ll respond immediately and shield the company&#39;s image before it spreads.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their unified resolve filled the room, and Luis allowed his gaze to drift slowly across their faces. A rare warmth flickered through him, pride threaded with gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a firm nod, his tone steady but tinged with emotion. &#34;Each of you was chosen by my father, and together we&#39;ve carried Sampson Group through storms that would have sunk lesser families. As long as we stand together, Sampson Group will remain unshaken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush fell over the room as emotion showed on every face. Each person rose and moved in unison,bowing to Luis with a plain, determined grace. The elder gentleman declared, &#34;You have our full support,Mr.Sampson. We will stand with you and do whatever it takes.&#34;Across town, in the Kirk Group CEO suite, plans were unfolding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Kirk, everything is on track. Once Luis shows up at the spot of the transaction and the police arrive there, the Sampson name will be broken. Then we step in and claim what follows.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A middle-aged man leaned in close, his smile oily as he laid out the scheme.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood let that sink in and then allowed a self-satisfied grin to spread. &#34;Luis still does not understand the game here. I will remind him who runs Ochrerayd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stretched back in his chair and propped his feet on the desk, letting his posture say more than his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow crossed his face as a new thought sharpened his expression into something predatory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not slack,&#34; he warned. &#34;Make sure Rowland handles the message with extreme care so nothing slips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man across from him nodded eagerly, his flattery obvious. &#34;You have my word, Mr. Kirk. I am watching Rowland closely. His grandparents are leverage. If he betrays us, he will pay dearly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. I&#39;m counting on you to see it through.&#34;  Sherwood slowly raised his eyelids and fixed the middle-aged man with a sharp, unblinking stare that held both warning and expectation. &#34;This job has to go off without a hitch. If it falls apart, we both go down with it.&#34;</p>
