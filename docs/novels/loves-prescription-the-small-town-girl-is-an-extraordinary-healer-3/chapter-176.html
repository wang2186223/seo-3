                <p>Jacob wasted no time, pulling strings with the most reputable entertainment companies in Shoildon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before half a day had passed, scandalous reports about Katelyn spread across the internet like a raging fire in dry grass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The image of Shoildon&#39;s darling,Katelyn Fuller-once praised for her elegance and poise-has left the public reeling. She has been caught frequenting nightclubs and entertainment spots, always surrounded by men!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within hours, the story had surged to the very top of Shoildon&#39;s trending topics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone who clicked on the article was met with a barrage of photos and videos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first photo showed Katelyn in a nightclub,lounging on a sofa between two men. A row of shirtless, muscular men stood before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the second photo, she straddled one man provocatively, her head tilted back,eyes heavy with intoxication and indulgence, as though savoring forbidden fruit. To any discerning eye, it was clear-  her actions spoke of anything but respectability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came a video, more than ten seconds long.Though the bar&#39;s corridor was lit by dim, colorful lights, one could still see Katelyn entwined with a bearded man against the wall. As the clip ended, her hand slid slowly from his abdomen downward... The act was brazen, a complete contradiction to the image of a demure lady she had so carefully cultivated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next followed a few more photos, each showing her entering hotels with different men. In some,she was even accompanied by more than one at a time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the news broke, the comments section erupted into a feast of gossip. To those in Shoildon&#39;s social circles-where Katelyn&#39;s upright persona had always been the talk of the town-it was like watching a porcelain mask shatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I seeing this right? Is this really the gentle and elegant Katelyn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gentle and elegant? That was just her mask. The moment she left home ground, her true self showed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew it! She always struck me as pretentious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Notice anything? Not one man is the same. She&#39;s juggling partners like spinning plates-doesn&#39;t she worry about disease?&#34; &#34;If she worried, she wouldn&#39;t live so recklessly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable! She&#39;s handling them like a professional entertainer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t stand hypocrites like her. She always acted like some untouchable saint, sneering at others for a little fun. But behind closed doors, she&#39;s no different from those she mocked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right, just look at that second video-she&#39;s skilled,like she&#39;s done this a hundred times.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t she once the picture of purity, throwing herself at lsaac with such persistence that all of Shoildon knew of it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I used to pity her, thinking Isaac was cold. Now I see -it was all an act. She&#39;s nothing short of a stage actresS.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comments section was flooded with ridicule toward Katelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across group chats too, the buzz about &#34;Katelyn&#39;s double face&#34; grew louder, especially among the wealthy youth who had brushed shoulders with her before. Their words cut sharper than knives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought my friends were outrageous, but compared to Katelyn, they&#39;re tame.&#34; &#34;Exactly! Just days ago, my mom praised her, telling me I could never match her. Now? I can&#39;t stop laughing-I&#39;m definitely not that promiscuous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same here. She was always the &#39;perfect daughter&#39;parents admired. Who knew she hid such scandal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her phone buzz relentlessly, Kaia assumedit was another storm of insults aimed at Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed her phone, only to be stunned-every message was about Katelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She logged onto social media and saw the trending post.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened as she clicked and watched,disbelief spilling from herlips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No... this can&#39;t be Katelyn,&#34; she murmured to herself,disbelief filling her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her idol had always seemed beyond reach, as though carved from a pedestal of virtue. How could she be painted with such wanton colors? Young men she might have understood-but older men too? It was beyond imagining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia thought it through and scrolled back in her group chat. The conversation had originally centered on Verena&#39;s troubles. Then suddenly, the internet  exploded with Katelyn&#39;s scandal, burying the previous gossip. Such a drastic shift couldn&#39;t have been coincidence. Someone must have deliberately unleashed Katelyn&#39;s dirt to drown out talk of Verena&#39;s affair with Tobin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts fell neatly into place. To Kaia, there was no doubt-this was Verena&#39;s handiwork. Who else would be cunning enough to twist the situation? She must have hired people to smear Katelyn, to shift the spotlight and save herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s impatience boiled over. This had to be handled at once, or the damage to Katelyn&#39;s reputation would be irreversible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forwarded the trending post to Katelyn, adding,&#34;Katelyn, this must be Verena&#39;s scheme. She&#39;s pulling strings to smear you. You need to act fast and put an end to this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Katelyn saw the message, her mind went blank.For a heartbeat she stood frozen, overwhelmed.Because deep down, she knew-this was no fabrication. Every photo, every video... had really happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage swept through her like a storm. She slapped a cup off the table, face flushed scarlet, her voice breaking into a roar. &#34;How? How could this happen?Who did this?&#34; Who had betrayed her? Who dared to expose it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet before her anger had fully taken shape, another blow landed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On social media, a second story surged to the very top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katelyn favors both young and old-never refusing anyone! Truly the &#39;pure and seductive&#39; woman of Shoildon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill crawled through her at the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clicked it open, and what she saw drained the strength from her legs. She slumped heavily onto the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time,the gallery contained more intimate photos,with men far older than the rest. Three photos were of the same man, taken from different angles-he looked at least sixty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The new revelation caused a bigger storm than the first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crowds multiplied, even people who had never heard of Katelyn before joined in the ridicule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought the clip of her reaching into a man&#39;s pants was the peak of scandal-but this tops it.&#34; &#34;My word! With men this old? It&#39;s revolting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s chasing thrills in the most questionable wNays.Imagine the germs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The insults poured in, sharper and uglier with each refresh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then one user noticed something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait-doesn&#39;t this old man look like the director of Cloverland Hospital abroad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is he? Is that someone important?&#34; another asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course! Every medical student knows him-his textbooks are torture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on, I think I saw an old report about him. He&#39;s a giant in medicine. Let me dig it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, someone unearthed an article-an interview with none other than the director of Cloverland Hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It really is him! Katelyn was entangled with someone that high up in the field?&#34;</p>
