                <p>The past weeks had drained Isaac, leaving him running on barely four hours of sleep from the night before.Events like this hardly seemed worth his time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reading his mood, the assistant simply replied, &#34;Understood. I&#39;ll let them know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roughly an hour later, Verena&#39;s car rolled up to the venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The restaurant radiated charm-every corner was dressed in elegance, with subtle touches of romance that softened the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A waiter greeted her at the entrance and led her toward a secluded private room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing at the door, he knocked, and then pushed it open with a polite announcement.&#34;Mr. Bennett,your guest has arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stepped inside, and the door closed quietly behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From his wheelchair, Isaac&#39;s gaze followed her every step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her white dress brushed her ankles, a camel shawl resting gently on her shoulders, while her hair spilled down her back likea glossy waterfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were no designer tags or ostentatious brands on her, yet she carried herself with a presence that made society&#39;s most polished women seem ordinary. The old saying came to mind-true elegance was born from beauty, figure, and poise. She possessed all three in abundance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the briefest moment, something familiar stirred in Isaac&#39;s mind... but before he could pin it down, the feeling slipped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Isaac&#39;s gaze fixed on her, Verena smiled warmly and greeted him, &#34;Mr. Bennett, it&#39;s been a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That smile of hers hit him harder than expected, and for a fleeting second, Isaac felt like a thief caught in the act of staring. Inclining his head, he said evenly, &#34;Please, take a seat, Miss Willis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena didn&#39;t bother with pleasantries. She sat down and spoke with clarity. &#34;I&#39;ve reviewed every detaii of your medical records. It&#39;s not as severe as it seems. Just set a date, and we can start treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers tightened slightly on the armrest before he asked, &#34;You&#39;re the first doctor to sound this certain.Are you absolutely sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could tell his doubt wasn&#39;t directed at her, but at the disappointment he&#39;d endured. Hope was a fragile thing for someone who had been let down too many times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning forward, she laced her fingers beneath her chin and met his eyes. &#34;You told me you&#39;d trust me. So why hesitate now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried a gentle lilt, almost coaxing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac blinked, his gaze sliding away as though her eyes were too much to hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved in amusement. &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Do you truly not believe me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head lifted instinctively, only to find her watching him with a brightness that seemed to outshine the rest of the room. He turned away almost instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a short pause, his voice dropped to a quiet, &#34;Sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about his own reaction unsettled him. Other women never rattled his composure, yet around Verena, the steady ground he stood on felt uncertain-like he was in unfamiliar territory with no map to guide him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the way he avoided her gaze, Verena remained silent for a moment, and then let out a soft,playful laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes lifted toward her, catching the curve of her smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint crease formed between his brows. &#34;You...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s with the solemn face, Mr. Bennett?&#34; she asked, her tone light. The sound of her laughter held an unfamiliar warmth, so unlike her usual composed reserve, carrying an ease that felt almost inviting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing she was poking fun at him, Isaac&#39;s lips curved in a faint, reluctant smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the waiter arrived with their food, the mood shifted into something more casual, their conversation flowing lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac kept his answers brief, letting Verena guide most of the exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They hadn&#39;t gotten far when the waiter, stepping back after setting down a plate, accidentally brushed the edge of the thin blanket over Isaac&#39;s knees with the walkie-talkie clipped to his pocket, sending it tumbling to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man immediately murmured an apology, but Verena was already on her feet. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it, 1&#39;lI handle it,&#34; she said quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze followed her as she bent to retrieve it and walked toward him, a subtle frown crossing his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing Isaac cared about cleanliness, Verena had stopped the waiter&#39;s intention to pick up the blanket and put it back on his legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook out the blanket neatly and set it on the chair beside him, her movements smooth and deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had just opened his mouth to refuse when Verena knelt gracefully at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, she slipped the shaw from her shoulders and spread it carefully across his legs,her fingertips lingering as she smoothed the fabric, grazing his thighs in fleeting touches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He, however, felt no sensation in his legs-only a strange mix of unease and familiarity as he studied her closeness. Why did it feelas though this level of tenderness belonged to a deeper bond? Was it merely because she was his future wife?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This blanket is far too thin. Make sure you swap it for something warmer when you&#39;re home,&#34; Verena murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he looked up again, she was back in her seat, the table between them once more. His eyes drifted toward her hands, and his voice came quietly. &#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze swept over him, a faint crease forming on her brow. &#34;Why&#39;s your face suddenly flushed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made him blink, caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ddn&#39;t look away, noting the warm tint across his cheeks and the slight haze clouding his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising, Verena stepped to his side, gently pushing back his hair to rest her palm against his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she leaned in to check his temperature, her body closed the space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s spine went rigid as a faint, soothing fragrance drifted into his senses, his line of sight now framed by her flawless features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp thud of awareness struck his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering his gaze, he felt his pulse quicken beyond reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without the shawl on her shoulders now, the elegance of her silhouette beneath the snug knit dress became more obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knot formed in his throat, and he almost turned away-until her firm voice cut in, &#34;Stay still.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though her tone carried an edge, it oddly wrapped him in a sense of comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s head dipped instinctively, eyes closing as his fingers clamped hard around the wheelchair&#39;s armrests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re running a fever,&#34; Verena murmured with a slight frown, pressing the call button on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had assumed his flushed face was from embarrassment, but clearly, it wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A waiter appeared moments later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With calm politeness, she suggested, &#34;Please bring some fever medicine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The server nodded and departed without delay. When the medicine arrived, she scanned the instructions, poured a glass of water, and extended both toward him. &#34;Here, take these.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; Isaac studied the pills inhis palm before asking quietly, &#34;Why do you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question hovered on his tongue-why did she care about him so much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through forming the words, his gaze locked with the lively light in Verena&#39;s eyes. A quiet chuckle escaped him, and he gave a small shake of his head. &#34;Forget it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he swallowed the pills, she leaned back slightly and asked, &#34;Have you decided on the hospital for the operation? Once we finish the first stage of treatment, surgery will still be necessary.&#34;</p>
