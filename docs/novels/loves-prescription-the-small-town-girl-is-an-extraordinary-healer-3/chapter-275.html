                <p>Inside the car,Isaac pulled Verena a little closer, her slender form tucked securely against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his head to look at her as she slept, his eyes dark and unreadable, like still water concealing secrets beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, she&#39;d been meeting Ivan more frequently. Each time she mentioned Ivan-always with complete honesty-jealousy twisted inside him,sharp and relentless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how transparent she tried to be, it never fully soothed the knot in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac couldn&#39;t help but imagine what they talked about in those quiet, private moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did their conversations wander into old memories or drift toward plans yet to come?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was there laughter tinged with nostalgia, or silence heavy with the weight of things unsaid?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those questions circled endlessly, growing heavier each time they returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s imagination conjured scenes of Verena and Ivan together, and every image left a fresh ache, sharp as any wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind wandered to the delicate &#34;I&#34; inked on Verena&#39;s collarbone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she think of Ivan when her fingers brushed over it? Did memories of their old love still tug at her heart,even now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac couldn&#39;t chase those thoughts any further. Even letting them get this far sent a cold, anxious tremor through him, a panic he struggled to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Countless times, Isaac found himself on the verge of asking Verena what that tattoo meant to her, desperate to beg her to erase that singe,haunting letter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet every time the words reached his lips, they caught in his throat, swallowed by fear and uncertainty. The truth was, he was scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scared that the answer would be something he couldn&#39;t bear to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But one thing never changed-Verena was his wife in the eyes of the law, the mother of his child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what ghosts from the past lingered, Isaac refused to let her slip away. He would hold her close,regardless of whether old feelings for lvan still lingered in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would not share her-not with Ivan, not with anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze drifted to Ivan&#39;s apartment, eyes narrowing, a chill settling over his expression as if he could see through brick and glass to the man inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What right did he have to reappear, to meddle in their lives after all this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Ivan tried to step between them, Isaac wouldn&#39;t hesitate to fight back. He&#39;d protect his family, no matter the cost, even if it meant crossing lines he once swore he&#39;d never approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time sunlight slipped through the curtains, Verena was stirring, eyelids heavy as she woke to find Isaac stretched out beside her. He absently twirled a lock of her hair between his fingers, his gaze intent and thoughtful, lost somewhere far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guilt pinched at her chest the instant she saw him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night before lingered in a haze-she remembered coming home, collapsing into bed, and slippoing into uneasy dreams she couldn&#39;t recall but was sure had left her feeling unsettled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing she was awake, Isaac lowered his head, meeting her sleepy gaze. His voice was soft, edged with concern. &#34;Want to stay in bed a little longer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, mustering a gentle smile. &#34;Good morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac returned her greeting with a delicate kiss on her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a ritual she&#39;d come to treasure, his way of anchoring her at the start of every day. She found herself smiling, ready to leave the warmth of the covers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could rise, his hand reached out, drawing her back with a firm but gentle hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused,Verena looked up at him, asking, &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He traced the curve of her cheek with his fingers, searching her face as if he could read every unspoken thought hiding in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, he caught his own reflection in her eyes-so clear, so close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, a shadow passed through him, doubt flickering deep inside. Was he the only one that occupied her heart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze grew darker as the memory of the previous night pressed in on him, old fears and fresh uncertainty mingling behind his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last nigt, Verena&#39;s tears had stained Isaac&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But who had she been weeping for?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac felt caught in a spiral, chasing questions when the answers sat heavy on his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He curled his fingers into a fist beneath the sheets, an ache of dread tightening around his lungs until it hurt to draw breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like ages, he finally managed to speak, voice rough and unsteady.&#34;Verena,kiss me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words trembled between plea and demand, longing tangled with quiet desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t pick up on the edge beneath his request. With a faint arch of her brows, she let out a soft laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d braced for a confrontation about last night. Instead, he only wanted a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the hope and worry mingling on his face, Verena leaned over, pressing a quick kiss to his lips before pulling back, ready to start her day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was caught off guard when Isaac&#39;s hand tightened around her wrist, drawing her back into his arms. His eyes fell, lashes heavy and shadowed, masking whatever storm brewed beneath. But the tension in his jaw and the press of his lips made his frustration clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That wasn&#39;t enough. I want to feel it.&#34; His voice was husky,filling the stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena hesitated, studying the intensity in Isaac&#39;s eyes, unsure what storm brewed behind his steady gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obliging him, she leaned in once more, pressing another soft kiss to his lips, careful and delicate-almost like sealing a promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Isaac&#39;s eyes never left her mouth, darkening with frustration. &#34;That&#39;s not enough,&#34; he said, his voice low and rough. &#34;I want more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was deeper now, an edge of hunger threading through each word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena felt a flicker of confusion at his insistence. Isaac could be passionate, but he&#39;d never demanded a kiss with such raw need before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she let the thought go, giving in to the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved closer, this time letting her lips linger and part against his, lightly tracing and sucking on his lower lip.	A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint trace of cherry blossom drifted between them-her signature scent, soft and distinct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Isaac only grew more restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath came heavier, and he tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, his Adam&#39;s apple bobbing as he swallowed. &#34;You can bite,&#34; he whispered, voice drenched in longing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words startled her, making her freeze for a heartbeat, her eyes darting away in uncertainty,flustered by the unfamiliar boldness in his request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena searched his eyes, certain he had to be teasing, but found nothing playful in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long pause hung between them. Then, with a mix of teasing and genuine wonder, she asked, &#34;Isaac, since when were you into this sort of thing?&#34; She didn&#39;t get a chance to hear his answer. Isaac caught her words on his mouth, kissing her hard, his hand threading through her hair and holding her close, his touch full of urgent longing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her protests melted away, lost against his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hunger for her was overwhelming, a force that left her breathless and shaken in his arms.</p>
