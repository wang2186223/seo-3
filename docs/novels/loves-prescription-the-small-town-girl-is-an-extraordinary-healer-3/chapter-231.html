                <p>At Shoildon Airport, amid the constant shuffle of travelers in the crowded hall, a man strode forward with unhurried confidence, and at once, all eyes seemed drawn to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His back was straight, his steps measured, carrying the quiet authority of someone accustomed to command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face,chiseled with cold precision, was made all the more striking by eyes sharp as a blade, eyes that carried a chill like winter frost. A faint scar traced across his skin-a silent reminder of past battles,lending him a rugged,unforgettable charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though countless glances followed him,Luis remained unmoved,his gaze fixed steadily on the path ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,the moment he stepped out of the airport and realized the driver he had arranged was nowhere in sight, a faint crease lined his brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, his phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered, displeasure flashing briefly in his eyes.&#34;Where&#39;s the car?&#34; An anxious voice came through the line. &#34;I&#39;m terribly sorry, Mr. Sampson. The driver met with an accident on the way. I&#39;ve already dispatched a replacement,but it may take some time...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis cut in, his tone clipped. &#34;How long?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant faltered. &#34;The new driver is a distance away, and with traffic this heavy, at least... an hour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was longer than the time he had promised to meet Simon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a man of Luis&#39; stature, others usually bent to his schedule. Yet, paradoxically, he was the sort who would never break his own word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To put it bluntly, he had a streak of obsession with punctuality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting his chin, his gaze fell on a sleek black Bentley slowly rolling toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke into the phone, voice calm as still water.&#34;Don&#39;t bother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he ended the call and slipped the phone neatly into his coat pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the Bentley, Verena gripped the steering wheel  with one hand, her eyes steady on the road ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a tall man in a black trench coat came into view, striding directly toward her car as though intent on blocking her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Broad daylight, in a law-abiding society-what was he thinking? Was this some poorly thought-out ploy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena eased the car to a stop and lowered the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, is there something you need?&#34; she asked evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the window slid down, Luis finally saw her face clearly, and for a fleeting moment, his eyes sparked with interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman before him was strikingly beautiful-slightly upturned eyes laced with quiet allure, a nose sharp in its symmetry, and lips naturally red,untouched by any makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the kind of beauty that could turn heads without trying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet what made her stand apart was the frost in her gaze-cold, distant, like the pale moon on a midwinter night, both breathtaking and beyond reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis regarded her with a trace of admiration. Beauty was common, but beauty wedded to pride and distance-such women were rare gems indeed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, he reined himself in and spoke with measured courtesy. &#34;Would you be willing to take me to Nandita Restaurant? I&#39;ll make it worth your while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And, as if to ward off disbelief, he added lightly, &#34;One million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the man stood by the car door, free of the glass between them, Verena had a full view of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was momentarily taken aback, but recognition soon dawned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen him in the news, and Miranda had spoken of him often-a figure wielding immense power within Akoitha&#39;s underground forces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reputation so formidable that one had to see him in person to believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed,impressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wealthy heir through and through, tossing out a million as casually as spare change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such status left little room to suspect deceit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nandita restaurant? It lay barely five hundred yards from her hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena tilted her chin, gesturing lightly toward the back seat. &#34;It&#39;s on my way. Get in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Luis settled in, Verena set the car in motion again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drove with one hand steady on the wheel, the other resting against the window frame, her slender fingers tapping a casual rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At a red light, the car slowed to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena glanced into the rearview mirror, her eyes narrowing slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If memory served her right, the latest reports had placed him abroad, expanding his empire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet here he was, back in the country in less than two months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing her gaze, Luis looked up and caught her eyes in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unperturbed at being discovered, Verena shifted her attention away, only to notice his hand, like hers,drumming lightly against the window with the same idle rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis seemed to notice as well, and his brow lifted ever Their eyes met again in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three seconds later, both allowed a faint smile to appear.</p>
