                <p>Isaac caught the glimmer in Verena&#39;s gaze, a trace of longing that stirred something deep inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when their closeness erased the distance between them did he feel certain that Verena&#39;s affection was genuine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet certainty wasn&#39;t enough; what he craved was to be the only one who occupied her heart at every moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thumb brushed against the corner of her lips as he whispered, &#34;Leave out the last four words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of confusion crossed Verena&#39;s face. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning closer until the bridge of his nose almost touched hers, Isaac spoke in a low rasp. &#34;Repeat what you just said, but drop the last four words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meaning dawned on her then. He wanted to hear the sweetness again, and she didn&#39;t mind giving it.Slowly,she enunciated each word. &#34;Isaac, I really like you.&#34; As those words echoed in his mind, he wished with all his heart that she would mean them for the rest of their lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand tilted her chin upward before he pressed his mouth to hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath soon grew uneven, and when he noticed,Isaac drew back slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena inhaled deeply to steady herself, but he pulled her close once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body gave no resistance to his closeness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers slid into his hair, weaving through the strands with an intimacy that made his pulse race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Verena was with someone she cared for, no amount of time ever felt like enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The white blouse she wore hung open at the top,several buttons undone, leaving her neck and collarbone exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s lips traced across her skin, leaving faint marks along her collarbone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his lips drifted lower, he paused, his fingers brushing against the small &#34;I&#34; tattoo etched there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the very first time he noticed it, he had made a  habit of shutting his eyes during their intimate moments, choosing to pretend it didn&#39;t exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confronted with it once more, Isaac realized he could no longer deny the truth staring back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could the &#34;I&#34; tattooed on her skin really stand for lvan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His throat constricted as the word slipped out in a low murmur.&#34;I.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gathering the nerve, he fixed his eyes on hers and asked, &#34;Do you honestly love that letter so much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lashes fluttered, her expression softened,and she seemed entirely absorbed in the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned close to his ear and whispered with deliberate weight, &#34;It&#39;s the one I cherish most.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s jaw tightened,his fists curling hard, and then he crushed his mouth against hers with sudden force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The abruptness drew a startled gasp from Verena,though soon her body responded instinctively to his fervor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed harder, claiming every breath she tried to take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The intensity became too much, and Verena pushed against him with a small effort. Her resistance only fueled the storm inside him,jealousy flaring hot, his eyes burning red as his control wavered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The possessiveness he had tried to cage surged out,and he gripped her as though he could never let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She softened within his arms, tilting her face to place a tender kiss on his chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden vibration cut through the air. Buzz... Buzz...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breath ragged, lsaac raised his head and asked between gasps, &#34;Do you want me to end the call?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest rose and fell quickly, and she gave a small nod. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as she reached for the phone, Isaac&#39;s arm stayed firm around her waist, his lips brushing against her ear in a lingering touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen lit up with the caller&#39;s name, and Verena hesitated,worried Ivan might be calling for something urgent. Turning to lsaac, she murmured, &#34;Wait a second. I need to answer my friend first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name &#34;Ivan&#34; flashing on the screen made Isaac&#39;s eyes darken with jealous fury. Without hesitation, he snatched the phone from her hand and powered it off, his expression hard and unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena parted her lips to protest, but Isaac buried his face against her neck and murmured, &#34;You told me to hang up. Once you decide on something,you shouldn&#39;t take it back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing she had contradicted herself, Verena gave a small nod. &#34;Alright, I won&#39;t go back on my word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s head pressed more firmly against her skin, his hold unrelenting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing a shift in his mood, Verena slid her hands to his waist, trying to lift him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arms closed tightly around her, but his legs remained unmoving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The effort to roll over seized his body; what was effortless for most felt like scaling a sheer cliff for him.No matter how hard he pushed, his legs refused to obey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration poured over him in a freezing wave, his cheeks swelling with strain, the veins on his arms standing out like cords. That sense of helplessness wrapped him in suffocating silence, stealing the very air from his lungs. Even in the heat of desire, the simple act of turning exposed every weakness he wished to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding his struggle, Verena moved quickly,flipping him onto his back as though to take control herself, but Isaac stopped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t.&#34; His lashes fell, and the tremor in his voice betrayed him. &#34;We should wait until my legs recover.I can&#39;t stand the thought of you seeing me so powerleSS.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart ached for him, but she knew words would do little to ease the sting of his pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she pressed a gentle kiss to his forehead and whispered with a faint smile, &#34;There&#39;s no need to hurry.Once you&#39;re healed, we&#39;ll have all the time in the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Shoildon Primary Hospital, Katelyn sat upright in bed, a magazine resting across her lap as a nurse carefully checked her injured arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden knock on the door drew her attention, and when she looked up, her eyes brightened at the sight of Waldo standing in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the nurse finished wrapping Katelyn&#39;s wound,  Waldo stepped into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing Waldo had summoned Verena to the station after his last visit, Katelyn quickly asked, &#34;Officer Collins,how is my case progressing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo&#39;s gaze carried weight as he answered evenly,&#34;There&#39;s no evidence linking Verena at the moment.The street cameras were sabotaged and remain unrepaired, so the trail of proof has gone cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s brows knitted together as she murmured,&#34;How could that happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a stern face and sharp eyes, Waldo responded,&#34;Katelyn, I need answers. According to Wendell Branson, you used threats against his family to force him into lying, making him say you were Evelyn. He has now formally accused you of endangering his safety. Do you admit this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, Katelyn lifted her eyebrows slightly.She had already anticipated the police would summon Wendell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that Wendell wNould betray her secrets didn&#39;t surprise her in the least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood that the police didn&#39;t actually care about whether she was Evelyn, so she chose not to conceal it. Keeping her composure, she answered,&#34;That&#39;s true, I&#39;m not Evelyn. But Officer Collins,  there&#39;s no law against pretending. I only asked him to help me build a false identity. Threats were never involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo&#39;s brow furrowed as his unwavering eyes bored into her. &#34;Then explain why he agreed to cooperate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet laugh escaped her before she said, &#34;The answer is simple. He took payment. Cash, jewels,treasures from auctions-his pockets were full. If you don&#39;t believe me, send your people to search Wendell&#39;s home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved faintly in satisfaction as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She congratulated herself for planning ahead, bribing Wendell&#39;s foolish son and greedy daughter-in-law long before this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, she released a measured sigh. &#34;Even after I gave him so much, Wendell still chose to betray me. It must be because Verena offered him new incentives. Officer, you need to judge this carefully. Wendell insists I threatened him, but it&#39;s Verena&#39;s guards standing outside his house. I never stalked him or laid a hand on his family. Don&#39;t let yourself be deceived by his lies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of experience had taught Waldo to distinguish lies from truth, yet without solid evidence,his hands were tied. His piercing gaze stayed locked on Katelyn as he warned, &#34;I expect your claim is true-that you haven&#39;t endangered anyone. If I discover otherwise, I won&#39;t overlook it. And as for the one who plotted the attack against you, we will uncover the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After delivering those words, Waldo turned on his heel and exited the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the door clicked shut, Katelyn reached for her phone on the bedside table and dialed a number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call went through, Kaia&#39;s eager voice rang out.&#34;Katelyn, is there something you need me to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A calm smile touched Katelyn&#39;s lips as she answered,&#34;Yes, Kaia, I have something important to tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity sparked in Kaia&#39;s tone. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was ambushed,&#34; Katelyn replied smoothly, her smile unwavering. &#34;And it was Verena who orchestrated everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s voice shot up in shock. &#34;What! Are you certain it was Verena? Katelyn, just say the word and I&#39;ll take revenge for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Kaia. I don&#39;t need retaliation.What I need is your help with something only you can manage.&#34; Kaia answered without pause, &#34;Then tell me. What should I do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to find a reason to get close to Verena,&#34;Katelyn instructed, her voice firm yet gentle. &#34;Stay under her roof if possible. Watch her carefully and learn who she keeps closest to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed as she spoke, a flicker of calculation glinting beneath her calm exterior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, it seemed, was proving to be a far more formidable opponent than Katelyn had imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, Katelyn suspected Verena carried a secret she was desperate to keep hidden.</p>
