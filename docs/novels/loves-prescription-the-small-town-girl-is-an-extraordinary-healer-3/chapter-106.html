                <p>Not wanting to keep Verena waiting, Miranda grabbed her suitcase and got ready to head out. &#34;Let&#39;s catch up another time. Dinner&#39;s on me when we meet again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia chimed in with a cheerful grin, &#34;Oh, there&#39;s no way we can let you pay, Miranda. You&#39;re Adrian&#39;s senior, after all. We should be the ones treating you.Why don&#39;t you share your number with us? That way,we can plan something when you&#39;re free. We won&#39;t keep you any longer-looks like you&#39;ve got somewhere to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian&#39;s eyes widened in surprise as he glanced at Kaia,clearly moved by her efforts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t expected Kaia to go this far just to snag his idol&#39;s contact details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda, meanwhile, was caught off guard by Kaia&#39;s directness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her offer had just been a polite gesture, never expecting them actually to take her up on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that the subject was out in the open, it felt awkward to turn them down. She figured she could always come up with an excuse to cancel later if she needed to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda rattled off her phone number, and Kaia repeated it back to make sure there were no errors.With that settled, Miranda headed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s grin wouldn&#39;t quit; she&#39;d actually gotten Miranda&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the head of one of the world&#39;s most powerful companies, Miranda was hardly the type to hand out her number carelessly. Kaia figured that, on top of her connection through Adrian, Miranda must really want to be friends with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the thought of it, Kaia&#39;s confidence soared.She felt ready to take on Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she could build a connection with someone this influential, then even if her parents turned their backs on her, Kaia believed she&#39;d still have a future ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One thing was certain: no matter what happened,she&#39;d never end up worse off than Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the airport, a sleek silver-gray car sat parked by the curb. A young woman in a wool coat leaned against the car,looking relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes stayed glued to her phone, scrolling absently as she waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda spotted Verena instantly after stepping out of the airport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging her suitcase, she rushed over and wrapped Verena up in a big hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, I&#39;ve missed you like crazy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right as Verena was about to redial Miranda&#39;s number,she found herself nearly tackled by an overenthusiastic Miranda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So much excitement poured out of Miranda that she put most of her weight on Verena, forcing Verena to brace herself to stay upright. Miranda&#39;s arms clung so tightly around her neck that Verena almost gasped for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick shove, Verena finally freed herself,taking a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but scold, &#34;Why are you still so wild?You should at least try to look the part of a CEO once in a while!&#34; Miranda,never one to care about appearances,tossed an arm around Verena&#39;s shoulders and lifted Verena&#39;s chin with her fingers. A playful grin tugged at her lips as she teased, &#34;Oh, Evelyn! You get prettier every year. Don&#39;t make me beg for a kiss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena laughed and gave Miranda a gentle nudge on the head. &#34;Cut it out! We&#39;re not overseas anymore.Don&#39;t call me Evelyn here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda nodded, glancing around as she whispered with a hand over her mouth, &#34;You&#39;re right, that name&#39;s off-limits here. Fame brings its own headaches,huh?You&#39;re talented, so people line up for your help, and a few just to stir up trouble. Feels like you need bodyguards at this point. Trust me, I get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena just shook her head with a smile and gestured to the car. &#34;Come on, let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda tucked her suitcase into the trunk and hopped into the passenger seat, ready for whatever came next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what&#39;s the plan? Are we heading to your place?&#34;Miranda asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Verena could reply, Miranda continued, &#34;How&#39;s life at home? Are your parents and siblings nice to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all these years, Miranda had uncovered every  secret and subtle dynamic within Verena&#39;s complex family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena navigated through traffic, only answering once they merged onto the main road. With a light laugh,she replied, &#34;Honestly? Things are a mess. We&#39;ve cut ties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Miranda was well aware that Verena wasn&#39;t close to her parents, but she never imagined things would fall apart this badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was it really necessary to go that far?&#34; she asked,her voice dropping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both hands tightening around the wheel, Verena kept her gaze straight ahead, her face unreadable. &#34;I&#39;m not the cold one here--it&#39;s them. My parents only saw me as a way to climb up the social ladder. All they ever did was use me. My siblings are no better. They&#39;ve always targeted me. Of course, I wish I had a real family,but not like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda focused on the word &#34;targeted,&#34; puffing herself up like a bodyguard. &#34;You mean they went after you? Tell me what happened! Next time I see them, I&#39;ll set them straight, just watch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flipped her hair back, putting on a show like she was ready to march right up and defend Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car rolled to a stop at a red light, Verena  reached over and flicked Miranda on the forehead.&#34;You&#39;re sweet for offering,but really,I can deal with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda knew her friend didn&#39;t like people meddling in her private business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out a sigh, she finally backed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the green light, they rolled forward, city lights blurring past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, if you&#39;ve cut your parents out, where are we actually going?&#34; Miranda wondered aloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena shot her a playful look. &#34;What, you think just because we&#39;re not headed to my parents&#39; place, we&#39;ve got nowhere to go? I&#39;m about to get married-the bride&#39;s supposed to leave from her own home, right?No way I&#39;m staying at a hotel or crashing at the Willis place. I bought myself a villa. That&#39;s where you&#39;re staying tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had offered to let Verena use one of his houses for the occasion, hoping to make things easier on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Verena turned him down. She wanted her wedding to be special, something unforgettable, not just another event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides,she&#39;d already hung Shawna&#39;s memorial photo in her new place. Home was wherever Shawna&#39;s spirit lived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda let out a low whistle and flashed a dramatic thumbs-up. &#34;Only the legendary doctor,Evelyn,could just buy a villa in Shoildon like it&#39;s no big deal. No wonder you&#39;re such a hotshot!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena just shook her head, unable to keep a straight face. &#34;Come on, cut it out. Last I checked, you&#39;re the CEO of AuroraNexus. Who&#39;s richer, really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They hadn&#39;t seen each other in ages, so the drive to the villa was filled with laughter and stories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they arrived, the maid had already prepped a warm meal. After they&#39;d eaten and both had a shower,it was close to midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never one to change, Miranda insisted on squeezing into Verena&#39;s bed after drying off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena made a show of complaining, but the truth was, she was glad to have her best friend by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the night quieted down, Miranda reached over and poked Verena&#39;s arm. &#34;Tomorrow is your big day. Are you nervous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bedside lamp bathed the room in a gentle,golden glow, making the whole scene feel soft and serene. Verena spent a few seconds gazing up at the ceiling before giving a slight shake of her head. &#34;Honestly? I&#39;m not sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the truth; she genuinely didn&#39;t know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By all logic, nerves shouldn&#39;t have even crossed her mind. She&#39;d already weathered more trials than most people could imagine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the thought of tomorrow sent her pulse into overdrive, fluttering in a way she wasn&#39;t used to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, lsaac&#39;s face drifted through Verena&#39;s thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Isaac feeling the same?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would Isaac be lying awake, nervous about tomorrow,too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what about-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Buzz...Buzz...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp buzzing sound cut Miranda off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena glanced at her phone on the nightstand and instantly broke into a soft smile at the name lighting up her screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching her phone, she slipped out of bed. &#34;Give me a sec,Miranda. I need to answer this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda just waved her hand dismissively, grinning. &#34;No need to explain. Your face says it all. It&#39;s your man,isn&#39;t it? Go on, take your call.&#34;</p>
