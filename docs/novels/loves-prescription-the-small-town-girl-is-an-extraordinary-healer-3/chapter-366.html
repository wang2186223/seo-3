                <p>Night had fallem over the Kirk estate, and Molly stood in the wide expanse of Sherwood&#39;s study,her gaze fixed on the polished floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration burmed in her eyes.After she wrestled with her thoughts, she fimally found the courage to say.&#34;Dad. Verena&#39;s been letting people go left and right.It&#39;s turning into chaos, and everyone&#39;s worried, Jared and some of the others keep coming to me for answers,but I honestly have no idea what to tell them.She holds a higher position than I do, which means there&#39;s nothing I cam do to stop her, I&#39;ve tried everything,but I just can&#39;t figure out how to get those people she let go rehired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood was lost in paperwork, but the moment he heard her words, he froze and raised his head, eyes narrowing with suspicion. &#34;Really? Verena actually dares to stir up trouble inside the company now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new concem crossed Molly&#39;s mind. Fighting back tears,she pressed her lips together before she said,&#34;And...Luis,he turned me down again, I triedreaching out, but he just won&#39;t talk to me.&#34; As soon as she brought up Luis, the dam broke. Tears slid down her cheeks, soaking into her blouse. &#34;Dad, I just don&#39;t understand why Luis refuses to give me a shot. I&#39;ve done a lot of things for him, but he won&#39;t even look my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching his daughter break down left Sherwood feeling helpless, an ache settling deep in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out a tired sigh, he rounded his desk and quietly approached her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped closer and rested his hand softly on Molly&#39;s shoulder, offering what little comfort he could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Henson&#39;s recent report and Howe&#39;s unexplained disappearance replayed in his mind,adding another layer of worry to his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was certain that Luis and Verena had already pieced together most of the truth about the past, and every day the odds seemed to tip further against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the silence, Sherwood finally called out,&#34;Molly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried a rough edge as he said, &#34;It&#39;s time to let go of your feelings for him. The Sampson family is against us now, and that fact isn&#39;t going to change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determination flickered in his eyes while his fingers  curled tightly at his side. &#34;We can&#39;t afford to let personal attachments distract us from what needs to be done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words left Molly in shock. She stared at Sherwood,unable to hide her disbelief. &#34;Dad, how could the Sampsons suddenly be our enemies? And what about Luis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luis and Verena are both out to destroy me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That revelation made Molly freeze, her breath catching as she struggled to process what he&#39;d just confessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood paused for a steadying breath, and then continued, &#34;Molly, there&#39;s a lot I tried to protect you from because I didn&#39;t want you to get hurt. But I can&#39;t keep it from you anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the past, I did something underhanded, all in an effort to undercut the Sampson family&#39;s business.Verena&#39;s disappearance was tangled up in that as well.Now that Luis and Verena know the truth, there&#39;s no way they&#39;ll forgive or forget.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After listening to Sherwood&#39;s confession, Molly simply stood there in stunned silence, unable to move or respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years spent by Luis&#39; side had taught her everything about his character. She realized that if Luis ever learned the truth about Sherwood&#39;s actions against his family, any hope of salvaging their relationship would vanish completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made Molly&#39;s heart sink. &#34;Dad,how could you do this? Do you have any idea what you&#39;ve put me through? If Luis ever finds out, he&#39;ll never forgive mne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears overwhelmed her, and she dropped to the floor,hands covering her face as sobs wracked her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood lowered himself beside her and wrapped her in a gentle embrace. &#34;Molly, please don&#39;t cry.What&#39;s done is already behind us. All we can do now is figure out a solution. You have to be strong, for the Kirk family&#39;s sake. We can&#39;t afford to fall apart right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept patting Molly&#39;s back, trying to offer some comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Molly&#39;s tears slowed, and she glanced up wvith fierce determination shining in her eyes. &#34;Dad,what are we supposed to do next? I can&#39;t just walk away from Luis. I need to find him, tell him the truth,and hope he&#39;lI listen to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wiped her face and made to leave the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood reached for her arm, his expression stern.&#34;Molly, stop! Rushing over to Luis now will only create more problems. We need to come up with a polan before making any moves toward him or Verena.&#34;</p>
