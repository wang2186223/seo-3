                <p>Verena wasted no time. She instructed Danica and Bobby to escort lsaac back to his hospital room, while she herself headed straight to her office to arrange Isaac&#39;s medical records. Once the files were in order,she turned on her heel and walked directly toward the psychology department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the entrance, she lifted her hand. Her slender fingers curled lightly, and her knuckles tapped against the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knock,knock, knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound drew the attention of several psychologists inside, heads turning one after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they saw Verena, one of the doctors quickly stood, asking with caution, &#34;Evelyn, are you here for an inspection?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn Model Hospital carried a reputation outwardly forits gentle and compassionate care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But behind closed doors, the truth was sterner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To remind every doctor of the weight of their duty and to prevent even a hint of negligence, random inspections were held across all departments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such measures were meant to separate the-wheat from the chaff, exposing those who treated responsibility lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that was why her sudden appearance had set their nerves on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reading the unease on their faces, Verena smiled, her tone calm.&#34;NO,I&#39;m here to see Dr. Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, the tension drained from their shoulders. A square-faced doctor stepped forward, answering,&#34;Dr.Moss went to collect some documents. I&#39;ll call him for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded, her smile poised between authority and approachability. &#34;Thank you. Please ask him to come to my office.&#34; Not long after she returned to her office, there came a knock at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena set aside the documents and looked up. Standing at the threshold was Simon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled faintly, tilting her chin. &#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon entered and sat opposite her desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelyn, did you call me for something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fixed his gaze on her, quietly thrilled she had sought him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded, her tone steady. &#34;Yes. I need to discuss something important-about my husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on Simon&#39;s face froze. Her words pierced him like a sudden blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hope that had just flared in him was smothered as if by a cold downpour, leaving behind bitterness and anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his colleague mentioned Verena had summoned him, he had imagined she wanted something personal, perhaps even to ask about his familiar face. But no-she spoke of another man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy ate away at him, though he forced himself to keep a mask of composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He curved his lips into a gentle smile, feigning curiosity.&#34;Oh? And what seems to be troubling your husband?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena slid Isaac&#39;s medical records toward him. As he reached to take them, his fingers brushed against hers. A tremor ran through him, stirring restless desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He steadied himself quickly, lowering his eyes to the documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he studied them, Verena spoke. &#34;I remember your resume. Your main discipline was psychology, with clinical practice added later. And the hospital you worked at in Clokron is famous for its psychological department. That&#39;s why I&#39;d like you to treat my husband.&#34; As Simon leafed through Isaac&#39;s records, a faint, icy gleam crossed his eyes. So, even after all this, Isaac still clung to life-tenacious to the point of defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet his thoughts soon twisted. What appeared as Isaac&#39;s strength was, in Simon&#39;s mind, merely borrowed time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last survival had been nothing more than a stroke of luck, a coin tossed in his favor. But fortune, like a fickle companion, rarely walks the same road twice. This time, Isaac might find Lady Luck turning her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, outwardly, Simon&#39;s expression softened into a warm smile. &#34;Of course. That&#39;s my duty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena leaned forward, explaining carefully,&#34;Isaac was in a car accident months ago. The driver and his father died instantly. His father shielded him with his own life, giving Isaac a chance to survive. But his legs were gravely injured. Recently, I operated on him myself. His body shows he can begin rehabilitation, but he&#39;s still unable to stand. His father died saving him. I believe the loss of his father has left him trapped in a shadow of grief.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, her lips curving with a sorrowful smile. &#34;The accident not only disabled him-it erased his memories of us. He&#39;s forgotten the love we once shared. Now, he believes our marriage is nothing more than a family arrangement. He&#39;s burdened with loss, and he&#39;s forgotten me. I hope you can help him heal and restore what he&#39;s lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena spoke of Isaac, her mind slipped into their past, and joy lit her face. A blissful smile, like sunlight breaking through clouds, touched her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to Simon, that smile was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He longed to grip her shoulders, to shout that he was the one who truly loved her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Isaac? What was Isaac?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man fated for a wheelchair-how could he compare?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Simon&#39;s eyes, only he was worthy to stand at Verena&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she chose Isaac. What made Isaac better than him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made his eyes narrow, a storm brewing beneath the calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If memories had been erased, then why let them return at all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppressing his dark thoughts, Simon adjusted his glasses, his voice smooth. &#34;His symptoms match post-traumatic stress disorder. After severe trauma, the brain often hides away, shielding itself. Forgetting becomes a kind of armor, a defense against further harm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Verena and added slowly, &#34;This is a psychological issue-my specialty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s career was filled with cases that proved his skill. Verena had no reason to doubt him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew I chose the right person.&#34; Gratitude filled her eyes, her smile soft. &#34;Dr. Moss, I&#39;m entrusting my husband to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s lips curved. &#34;I will cure him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was gentle, his smile sincere. Yet in his eyes flickered a madness that went unnoticed. Verena arranged Isaac&#39;s psychological treatment for the next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew such sessions required privacy-just patient and doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But still, unease stirred in her. She wanted to see Isaac&#39;s reactions with her own eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She feared that Simon, however skilled, might ask a question that would reopen wounds instead of healing them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she discussed it with Isaac first. With his consent, she decided to install surveillance in the therapy room to observe quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally, she also informed Simon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Isaac entered the room, noticing his unease, Verena bent down, holding his hand. Her voice was warm and low.&#34;Think of it as an ordinary chat. Don&#39;t be nervous. I&#39;ll be right outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s hand brushed her cheek, his voice calm and deep. &#34;As long as I know you&#39;re outside, I won&#39;t be nervous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gazed at her tenderly, and she returned his look with a sweet smile, eyes glowing with affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together,they painted the picture of an enviable couple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for Simon, the sight was torment. Jealousy gripped him tight, his fists curling at his sides as he tore his gaze away.</p>
