                <p>Dusk had already settled beyond the windows by the time Verena stepped out of the resuscitation room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her movements were slow and uncertain, and the exhaustion etched across her face left no doubt about how drained she truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the lounge, her phone started buzzing, cutting through the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She checked the screen, saw the name flashing, and answered with a faint smile tugging at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s soft voice filled her ear the moment the line connected. &#34;Verena, are you done for the day? I&#39;m outside the hospital, waiting to take you out for something to eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a quiet breath, gathering just enough strength as she responded, &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll be down in a minute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, she slipped out of her lab coat,pulled on the jacket she had brought, and headed out of the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hospital lobby gave way to the evening air, and just outside, Isaac&#39;s car stood waiting at the entrance.The driver caught sight of her and stepped forward to open the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena offered him a polite thanks before climbing inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first thing she noticed was a sleek cake box balanced in Isaac&#39;s hand, his long fingers holding it with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved as she accepted it and settled it onto her lap, peeling back the ribbon. &#34;What made you decide on cake?&#34; she asked with genuine curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac busied himself with the utensils and answered with a hint of hesitation, &#34;I thought sweets were something every girl liked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The affection behind the gesture warmed her chest,though she couldn&#39;t resist teasing him. &#34;Oh? You seem awfully confident in knowing what women like, Mr.Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His calm unraveled as he hurried to explain, &#34;No, no.I didn&#39;t figure it out on my own. I just... came across it online.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually so self-possessed, he always unraveled whenever she aimed her playful words at him. Her laugh bubbled up before she could stop it. &#34;Relax,I was only joking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scooped a small bite of cream with her fork and tasted it slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lowered his gaze, his eyes following her movements in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she reached for the third bite, his voice broke the quiet. &#34;You&#39;re upset today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t phrased as a question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand froze midair as he added gently, &#34;Tell me,Verena. What&#39;s weighing on you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lifted, locking with Isaac&#39;s steady gaze,the weight of his silence urging her to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It startled her how easily he saw through her. She had thought her mask was intact, but he read her as if she&#39;d never tried to hide a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long time together had made them fluent in each other-one glance, a shift in tone, even the smallest gesture could expose the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside,Verena let out a quiet sigh. The day had been consumed by endless monitoring of the patient&#39;s fragile condition, leaving her no chance to rest. Even so, the haunting matter of Shawna&#39;s death lingered unresolved, gnawing at her every thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That weight made her chest tight, her nerves restless,her heart uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her carelessness had cost Shawna her life, and Verena had carried the weight of that mistake ever since she knew Shawna&#39;s death wasn&#39;t an accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, she hadn&#39;t uncovered the whole truth yet and hadn&#39;t found justice for Shawna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guilt pressed down on her,sharper every time she thought of her grandmother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Verena refused to share this with Isaac. He was already carrying enough on his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she brushed it off and said, &#34;I just ran into someone absolutely wild today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac trusted her without question. When she said that,he just nodded and said, &#34;Who was it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena let out a quick laugh. &#34;You&#39;re not going to believe it. Luis Sampson, of all people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was surprised. Luis Sampson? Wasn&#39;t he the influential figure ruling the Akoitha underworld?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s expression tightened while Verena added, &#34;He  literally cut me off in traffic at the airport just to ask for a ride to Nandita Restaurant. Since it was on the way, I agreed to take him, but during the drive, he asked for my contact information like it was no big deal...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden realization flickered across Verena&#39;s face.She glanced over at Isaac, catching the way his lips pressed into a straight line and how his dark eyes seemed bottomless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might have kept his emotions under wraps, but Verena could see right through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy was written all over his silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh slipped out of her as she leaned in close, her voice dropping to a playful whisper. &#34;Relax, Isaac.I let him know I&#39;m a married woman and shot him down right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That seemed to do the trick. Isaac&#39;s mouth curled into a genuine smile, his features softening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Switching topics, Verena added, &#34;Oh, before I forget,the psychologist will get here tonight. He&#39;s coming in from Clokron to Shoildon, so therapy can finally get underway. Just so you know, I won&#39;t push you into anything. Take your time and tell me when you&#39;re ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words seemed to catch lsaac off guard. For a  moment, he just stared, and then hope sparkled in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gripped her hand, steady and sure, before saying,&#34;With you in my corner, Verena, I can handle anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile appeared on her lips as she placed her hand on his and said, &#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac drew her closer, pressing a warm kiss to her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As another thought surfaced, he grew serious.&#34;There&#39;s something important I need to share with you,Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intrigued, Verena gave him her full attention. Isaac continued, &#34;I&#39;ve been digging into Simon&#39;s background.He&#39;s not exactly what he seems. According to the information I got, he&#39;s only interested in men. But the way he watches you doesn&#39;t match up with that, so I asked Slater to figure out the truth. Want to take a guess at what he found?&#34;</p>
