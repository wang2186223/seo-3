                <p>Inside the shadowed study of Kirk Villa, Sherwood lounged behind an imposing mahogany desk, its surface gleaming with intricate carvings that caught the dim light. A slender pen twirled between his fingers, clicking softly against his palm. His gaze,however, was anything but idle-cold, sharp, and carrying a sinister weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open, and Aiken stepped inside with a measured bow. A glint of pride lingered on his otherwise composed face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir,&#34; he began, his voice low, colored with faint amusement. &#34;It&#39;s done. I managed to buy off one of Luis&#39; men-a fellow by the name Rowland Green.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pen stilled mid-spin. Sherwood&#39;s eyes lifted,glinting like steel, his silence prompting Aiken to elaborate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rowland&#39;s an orphan,&#34; Aiken went on, licking his drying lips nervously. &#34;He&#39;s been living with his grandparents. So, I had them quietly taken away. As expected, the young man panicked. With his grandparents in our grip, he bent to our will  immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s mouth curled into a cruel smile. &#34;Humph.People with soft spots are the easiest to break.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set the pen aside, leaned forward, and laced his fingers together.atop the desk. &#34;But tell me-can he be trusted? How deep is his reach into Luis&#39; circle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quite far, sir,&#34; Aiken said quickly, eager to prove his worth. &#34;I&#39;ve checked thoroughly. Rowland oversees the movement of goods for Luis. Not the core inner circle, but close enough. With him in hand, slipping anything into Luis&#39; territory will be effortless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glimmer of satisfaction crossed Sherwood&#39;s eyes as he sank back into his leather chair. &#34;Good. Very good.But keep him on a short leash. And remember-his grandparents are our leash. If anything goes awry,you&#39;ll pay the price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler dipped his head swiftly. &#34;Yes, sir. I&#39;ll see to it personally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood gave a curt nod. &#34;That will be all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir.&#34; Bowing once more, Aiken retreated, the door closing with a muted click.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The study fell silent again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood exhaled slowly, slouching into the embrace  of his chair. His hand slipped into his jacket, rough fingers fishing out his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The device glowed against the dim room as he tapped in a number with practiced precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Molly was ascending the stairs, her steps light, a plate of jewel-toned fruit balanced in her hands. Dressed casually, she radiated a softness that seemed out of place in the brooding house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the landing, she nearly collided with Aiken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bowed swiftly, plastering on a respectful smile.&#34;Miss Kirk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly returned his smile with a gentle one of her own.&#34;Aiken, finished with your duties already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze drifted past him, lingering on the closed door at the far end of the corridor. &#34;Is my father still working?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aiken dipped his head, his voice cautious. &#34;Yes. He&#39;s still occupied with important matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow furrowed faintly, but the tension passed as quickly as it came. &#34;I see. I&#39;ll take him some fruit-he should rest a little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How thoughtful.&#34; Aiken stepped aside to  make way seizing the chance to flatter. &#34;Mr. Kirk hardly spares  himself rest. Having a daughter like you is truly his blessing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s lips curved into a modest smile. &#34;It&#39;s nothing more than my duty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With graceful ease, she stepped around him and continued upward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the study door, she paused, balancing the plate in one hand as she rapped lightly on the wood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No answer. A doubting small crease formed on her brow, but she pressed her palm against the knob and turned it, pushing the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she stepped into the room, the first thing she noticed was her father on the balcony, phone pressed to his ear, voice lowered to a conspiratorial murmur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No wonder he didn&#39;t hear me knock,&#34; she whispered under her breath, slipping quietly toward the desk to set down the fruit plate she carried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her task done, she drifted closer to the balcony,intending to gently coax her father in for a bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as the distance narrowed, his words sharpened in clarity. &#34;The last batch was pure. The next must match it exactly. I&#39;ll send you the time and place of the exchange later.&#34; Molly froze mid-step, the blood draining from her face. Shock flared in her wide eyes, her breath snagging in her throat. She didn&#39;t need a full explanation-growing up in this circle, she knew exactly what the words &#34;batch&#34; and &#34;pure&#34; meant.Contraband. Illegal goods. In other words, her father was involved in criminal activity!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood, oblivious,	continued his hushed conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when he hung up and turned back did his gaze land on Molly. She stood a few paces away, pale as moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of hesitation passed over him before his features melted into their familiar, practiced warmth.&#34;Molly, when did you get in? Don&#39;t just stand there have a seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heart hammering, she rushed forward, clutching his sleeve with both hands. &#34;Dad, we can&#39;t-this is dangerous, illegal! If you&#39;re caught, the consequences could destroy everything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of bristling, Sherwood&#39;s smile deepened,almost tender. He reached out, smoothing a hand over her hair. &#34;Sweetheart, you worry too much.I know what I&#39;m doing. I&#39;d never drag us into anything like that.&#34; Her taut nerves slackened at his reassurance, a shaky breath escaping her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then his voice shifted, chilling in its calm cruelty.&#34;I&#39;m going to let the Sampson family handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words slammed into her, knocking the air from her lungs. Molly&#39;s lips parted soundlessly, her face a mask of disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No... that can&#39;t be.&#34; She stumbled a few steps back,shaking her head. &#34;Dad, you&#39;ll ruin Luis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always assumed Sherwood&#39;s feud with the Sampsons was just a business skirmish, a matter of contracts, dirty tricks and cutthroat competition; just frictions here and there to teach Luis a lesson. At worst, she thought he meant to make Luis suffer financial losses, perhaps tarnish his standing in the industry. That, she could still rationalize. But this? This was deliberate ruin, a scheme to plant illicit goods and condemn Luis beyond redemption. It would not only shatter him but drag his entire family into devastation!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How foolish she had been to ever believe otherwise.And Luis-God, she loved him. How could she stand by and watch him meet such a tragic end?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers seized Sherwood&#39;s sleeve again, trembling.&#34;Please, Dad, I beg you-don&#39;t do this. Luis hasn&#39;t wronged us. We can&#39;t destroy him like this.&#34; But Sherwood wrenched his arm free,irritation flashing in his eyes. His smile was gone. His voice cut sharp.&#34;Molly, you&#39;re still far too naive.&#34;</p>
