                <p>Verena remained silent, her gaze sharp and unyielding, like shards of ice piercing through Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mouth twitched, his lips curling into a smile that was both crooked and false.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile was not warmth-it was distortion incarnate, a flicker of madness masquerading as charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since you figured it out, it means I have a place in your life,&#34; he said. &#34;Yes... I am Carl. I killed Simon Moss,but everything I did was to win you over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s brows drew together, a deep crease forming, heavy with disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her clear, unwavering eyes reflected pure disgust, as if she were staring at the embodiment of something vile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl gripped the edge of the table, leaning in, his voice trembling with obsession and frustration. &#34;Do you look at me with disgust now? Stop it! You must understand-no one has ever loved you as I do. Everything I&#39;ve done... it&#39;s all for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena let out a cold, short snort, thick with scorn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fixed him.with a steady gaze, her words slow and deliberate. &#34;Love? Stop insulting that word! What you catl love is selfishness. You killed my grandmother and orchestrated Isaac&#39;s car accident-all for you. Is that love? It&#39;s despicable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grandmother&#39;s death, Isaac&#39;s father&#39;s death, and Isaac&#39;s suffering-all traced back to the man before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena clenched her fists, her nails nearly cutting into her palms, her body trembling with restrained fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s handsome features now twisted into something monstrous. His face, once familiar, was now a demon&#39;s mask, raw and terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes bulged, bloodshot and feral behind his glasses, and he roared,&#34;Of course! Isn&#39;t this love? I didn&#39;t want to hurt your grandmother, but if I didn&#39;t find a way to make you return home, you would have agreed to be with Isaac. I love you... how could I let that happen? How could he have the woman I can&#39;t?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising to his full height, his expression nearly unrecognizable, he continued, &#34;Evelyn, why? I met you at the same time as Isaac. Why him and not me? Because of his proud family? You look down on me, dismiss me,never even consider me. But I can reach that level too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He trembled, pointing at his elegant clothes, his mneticulously recreated appearance. &#34;Look! I have Simon&#39;s life now. I surpass most people. I am no less than lsaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried manic intensity, echoing through the room&#39;s tense silence. &#34;Whatever you desire, Evelyn, I will seize it. And if I cannot seize it... I will destroy the world to claim it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze never wavered from hers, a storm of obsession, madness, and bitter resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, slowly, his eyes drifted downward-to her slightly swollen belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, his eyes froze, a flare of outrage igniting in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want nothing else,&#34; he said, veins throbbing on his forehead like restless snakes. &#34;End his child. Do that,and we can bury the past. We&#39;ll find peace, a quiet life together, undisturbed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled, twisted and eager, lost in a dream only he could see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Carl admit to his crimes, Verena&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief, pupils shrinking as molten rage rose inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The murderous heat in her gaze could shred him to pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to contain herself, she stood abruptly, slamming her hands on the table with a resounding crash that sent glasses rattling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lunatic! Pervert!&#34; Her voice broke with fury,almost a hysterical shout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl... you ask why I chose Isaac? It&#39;s because he&#39;s not vile and disgusting like you. Being desired by you is the gravest insult I&#39;ve endured. Had I known your true nature, I would have left you to rot in your ruin.&#34; She lowered her hands to rest on her belly, her voice gentler but firm. &#34;This child... is the fruit of our love.Isaac and I will nurture them, give them all the love they deserve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes rose again, cold and disdainful. &#34;And you... you will always lurk in others&#39; shadows, stealing names and faces like a rat in the dark, reeking of everything vile. You will never know true love, nor will you ever deserve it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl stared,capturing the unmasked hatred in her gaze-a look like an icy blade sinking into his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His maniacal eyes flared, refusing to accept reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lunged at her, but two bodyguards intercepted him, restraining his struggling arms with iron grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! You can&#39;t do this! You can&#39;t hate me!&#34; he shouted, voice ragged. &#34;Everything I did... it was for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything you did?&#34; Verena stepped forward, unshaken. &#34;Everything you did only hurt the people I love.Carl,know this-I will repay the pain you caused a thousandfold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha ha ha...&#34; He erupted into laughter, sharp, unhinged, and bone-chilling, his body shaking with madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelyn... you cannot defeat me. I still have Luis. He obeys me. If you come for me, he will fight Isaac to the death. You know what Luis is capable of. Do you think Isaac will survive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, as if flipping a switch, his expression softened, his voice dripping with feigned sweetness.&#34;Darling...let me go. You and I are meant to be. No one else is worthy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Verena&#39;s tone was calm but cutting.′′Arnd how can you be so sure Luis will help you? If that&#39;s the case, I can call and check.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock crossed his face as Verena, unhesitating, pulled out her phone and dialed.. Sampson... please come in. It&#39;s time for you to show up.&#34;</p>
