                <p>As the party drew near, most of the guests had already gathered within the brightly lit hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By contrast, the back garden lay in quiet repose, like a hidden sanctuary set apart from the noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only now and then did a passerby wander along the winding stone paths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun had long dipped beyond the horizon, and the last traces of daylight slowly surrendered to dusk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When night finally fell, the moon began its slow unveiling,scattering mottled light through the swaying branches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis walked in front,tall and composed, his figure etched sharply in the moonlight. His shadow stretched long upon the ground, as though blending into the fabric of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind him, Miranda followed with measured steps,her high heels clicking softly against the stone path,the crisp sound distinct in the hush of the evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a time, neither spoke. The night breeze teased Miranda&#39;s hair as she kept her eyes on Luis&#39; broad back,her expression at ease, giving no sign that she would be the first to break the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he walked ahead, Luis seemed to sense her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every so often, he cast a glance over his shoulder,his eyes brushing past her elegant silhouette before he lowered his lashes, his profile set in stern coldness beneath the moon&#39;s glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a silence that felt without measure, Luis finally lifted his wrist to check the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three minutes had slipped by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked back again. The woman behind him still strolled at leisure, unhurried and unbothered, making no move to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis stopped at last, turned, and fixed his gaze upon her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Brown,&#34; he said, his voice breaking the standstill -low yet ringing clear. &#34;My sister told me you wished to speak with me about a business matter. Since neither of us has time for idle talk, say what you mean plainly.&#34; Miranda lifted her eyes to his, her expression unreadable. His gaze was dark and fathomless, reminding her of still waters, cold and detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved into a faint, knowing smile. &#34;Mr.Sampson,you sound impatient. But business is only a veil.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; brows knitted slightly, though her words did not catch him entirely off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face remained calm, the corners of his lips curving with the slightest hint of irony. &#34;Is that so? Then what&#39;s your real intention, Miss Brown?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped closer, narrowing the distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes gleamed as she tilted her head, one brow lifting. &#34;It&#39;s been years since we last met, Mr. Sampson.Can&#39;t we catch up? Or have you conveniently forgotten that night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her slender fingers brushed across his chest, the gesture deliberately playful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis neither flinched nor drew back. His gaze lowered to hers. &#34;Miss Brown, that night was nothing more than mutual consent,no strings attached.I had thought you weren&#39;t one to linger on what&#39;s past.&#34;  her breath sweet as spring blossoms. &#34;And yet, Mr.Sampson,can a man truly erase such a night of fire? I,for one, cannot forget your fervent kisses, and that-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis cut across her words, his brows taut. &#34;If tonight is nothing but a rehearsal of old tales, then I fear you will leave disappointed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his tone was steady, a fleeting shadow stirred in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda pretended not to hear, tracing idle circles across his chest with her fingertip, her voice playful.&#34;Tell me, aren&#39;t you the least bit curious if I thought of you these years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing a measured breath, Luis caught her wrist,stilling her hand. &#34;Miss Brown, we&#39;re both adults. That night was indulgence, nothing more. No force, no promises-and it should bear no weight on the present.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda slipped free from his grasp, placing her hands behind her back as she strolled lazily around him,her eyes boldly sweeping over his figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you have to be so serious? I never said I wished to cling. We both enjoyed ourselves. I simply admired your... performance, Mr. Sampson. No need to look at me as if I were a storm cloud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; eyes followed her, a dry scoff escaping. &#34;Miss  Brown, turning the bedroom into a stage for talk is quite the novelty. If that&#39;s all, then I&#39;ll take my leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made to step away, but Miranda blocked his path,her head tilted, her eyes alight with teasing. &#34;Mr.Sampson, why so eager to run? Afraid a passerby might overhear-or is it your own heart that falters?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His Adam&#39;s apple shifted, his lips twitching as though words pressed tó escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda suddenly caught something, her interest piqued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted a hand, tracing beneath his eye with her fingertip, her voice soft as silk. &#34;I recall that night being rather reckless. I didn&#39;t expect I&#39;d leave a small scar here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just below his left eye, a faint mark lay hidden like an ornament-subtle,yet lending a roguish edge to his otherwise composed face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s tone carried both jest and memory, her words a riddle of intent. &#34;Let me think... I&#39;d had a drink or two, and the air was heated. Was it my nail that scratched you, or was your strength to blame, and I simply lost myself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers lingered at the scar, gently stroking as though retracing old heat. Bathed in the blurred glow of moonlight, she leaned closer, their bodies nearly touching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her warm breath fanned his neck, and Luis stiffened,his gaze wavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped back sharply, turning aside to evade her touch. &#34;Miss Brown,watch your behavior.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she, unfazed, only smiled with sultry delght.Twining his necktie around her finger,she whispered,&#34;Why keep such distance, Mr. Sampson? We were once close enough to breathe the same air. Tonight,we&#39;re merely reminiscing. Loosen up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis stood rooted, his eyes dark and unreadable.&#34;If you insist on dragging that night back into the light,Miss Brown, then we are finished talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips tilted in sly amusement, her gaze brazenly sweeping him. &#34;Very well. If you dislike reminiscing,then grant me one request.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; brow creased, knowing instinctively her words carried noinnocence,yet he waited in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head, eyes half-lidded, lips forming each word slowly, deliberately. &#34;Be with me one more time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Luis froze. The muscle beneath his  scar twitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his brows drew tight, and he hissed a single word.&#34;Absurd!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned on his heel, his stride swift, as though fleeing a shadow that chased him. Within moments,his tall figure melted into the depths of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda folded her arms, watching him vanish,a smile of hidden meaning tugging at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had seemed... unsettled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as for her-she was still intoxicated by the memory of his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head to the moonlit sky, lost in silent thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their story, she felt, was far from its final chapter.</p>
