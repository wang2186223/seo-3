                <p>Molly bit her lower lip, tears shimmering in her eyes.&#34;Verena, I&#39;m at the end of my rope. I truly have no other choice-please, I need you to do mne this favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t pause for Verena&#39;s reply, her gaze instead fastening on the dagger. &#34;This dagger carries a heavy meaning. When I was fourteen, someone deliberately tried to harm Luis. In that moment, without a second thought, I rushed in to shield him. My clothes were drenched in blood, the pain nearly unbearable,yet all I could think about was keeping him safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes flickered in surprise as they settled on Molly&#39;s tear-stained face. She had never imagined Molly&#39;s feelings fo Luis ran so deep. What had begun as a tender sprout of young love had,over the years,hardened into something as unshakable as stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly sniffled, her voice thick with emotion though her gaze remained defiant. &#34;Luis promised me back then that he would grant me one request-no questions asked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her chin slightly, drawing in a breath to steady herself, though her words still trembled. &#34;All these years, I never called in that promise. Now I want him to honor it. My request is simple-I want him to marry me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes locked with Verena&#39;s, each word striking like a hammer on iron. &#34;Verena, please take my words and this dagger to Luis. Tell him I have waited all these years for this one moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena regarded her with an unreadable expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief silence, she spoke with measured seriousness. &#34;Molly, matters of the heart can&#39;t be forced. I&#39;ll deliver your message, but the final choice rests with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow furrowed faintly, her tone cool but not without sympathy. &#34;And think carefully-marriage should never be treated as a transaction bound to an old promise. If Luis isn&#39;t willing, then even a marriage in name alone will never bring you joy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Verena said no more. She turned and made her way to the garage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, her car rolled out of the garage,sweeping past Molly as she sped into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly stayed rooted in place, her shoulders slumped as though every ounce of strength had drained from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s words echoed in her mind, yet her devotion to Luis did not waver. Even if his heart was elsewhere,  she believed that being his wife-even in title alone -was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands clenched the hem of her shirt, and tears spilled freely down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the car vanish, she whispered fiercely to herself-she would not regret this,not ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Verena sat in her car. At a red light, she freed one hand, picked up her phone, and dialed Luis &#39; number with slender fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the line connected, she asked first, &#34;Luis, are you at the office?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rustle of papers sounded on his end before his voice followed.&#34;Yes,what is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have something for you. I&#39;m on my way now,&#34; she replied simply, ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, she arrived at the Sampson Group headquarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Parking her car, she strode directly inside, unhindered,until she reached the CEO&#39;s office door. She knocked lightly, and once permission was given, stepped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis was behind his desk, buried in paperwork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena approached and placed the dagger on his desk. Luis looked up at the sound, his deep-set eyes reflecting a flicker of confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his gaze fell on the dagger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned slightly, hesitation clouding his face.&#34;What is...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena drew out a chair and sat, her tone even but edged with irony. &#34;You do have a way of drawing attention, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gestured toward the dagger. &#34;Molly asked me to give this to you. You remember how she threw herself in front of that blade for you? She&#39;s invoking the promise you made back then-she wants you to marry her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; eyes lingered on the dagger, his thoughts dragged back to that night of chaos years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze narrowed, and he laid down his pen with a sigh heavy with weariness. &#34;That incident still gives me a headache.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena tilted her head in curiosity. &#34;Why? Is there more to the story?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis shook his head, his lips parting slightly. &#34;Even though the moment was dangerous, I&#39;d been trained rigorously from childhood. I could have avoided the strike.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret shaded his tone as he went on. &#34;But Molly rushed in, upending everything. Because of that, the real culprit slipped through our fingers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned back in his chair, arms folded across his chest, his face caught between emotions. &#34;The promise I made to her wasn&#39;t born only of duty.Sherwood did the Sampson family a great favor. That promise was my way of repaying him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened, his voice cooling like ice. &#34;But none of the promises I made extended to life&#39;s major choices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded slowly, her expression shifting from curiosity to realization. &#34;I understand. I&#39;ll tell her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her gaze steadied, more serious now. &#34;But there&#39;s something else I need to confirm with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her handbag she drew out the necklace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding the chain between her fingers, she let the silver pendant dangle, catching the light with a soft gleam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; eyes widened slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long moment, he only stared, hesitant, as though he doubted his sight. Finally, he reached out, his fingers closing around the pendant. When he saw the engraved letters, surprise rippled through his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, where did you come across this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At the Kirk family home,&#34; she replied evenly. &#34;I was waiting in the living room for Sherwood when their dog ran out with it and dropped it at my feet.I remembered the necklace you once described-the one Mom and Dad gave me after I was born. The moment I saw the initials, I decided to bring it to you to confirm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis studied the piece intently, his expression grave.He nodded slowly. &#34;There&#39;s no mistake. This is the necklace. Back then, Dad and I went all the way to Lasmiqua to meet the designer ourselves.We oversaw every step-from the concept to the materials.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up, locking eyes with her. &#34;So I can&#39;t be wrong. This is the necklace Mom and Dad prepared for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena tapped the table lightly with her fingers.&#34;When I disappeared, the necklace vanished with me.Now it turns up at the Kirk home. That&#39;s far too strange.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned forward slightly. &#34;Tell me-how were Sherwood and our parents getting along the year l was born?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; face grew solemn as he sank into thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rubbed his temple, searching his memory for cluJes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherwood had known Dad for some time,&#34; he began slowly, his voice rough with thought. &#34;But his ties with our family weren&#39;t very close then, and the business dealings between the two families were limited. It was only after you disappeared-when Mom and Dad were exhausted and the company took a severe blow-that he drew nearer to Dad and began appearing more often in both our lives and in business matters...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He broke off suddenly, disbelief flashing in his eyes.&#34;So... could your disappearance be linked to Sherwood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight in the room thickened as their eyes met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s my suspicion as well,&#34; Verena said gravely,her brows knitting. &#34;When I treated Sherwood today,he acted strangely. He pretended to be casual, but kept circling back to when his health would be fully restored. It felt off, so l deliberately told him he&#39;d recover in a month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze sharpened. &#34;If he is truly the mastermind behind what befell our family, then he may make his move within that time.&#34;Luis&#39; brows knitted together, a shadow darkening his stern face, fury sparking in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Sherwood is truly behind this, I&#39;ll make him pay-in blood,&#34; he snarled, each word torn through clenched teeth, his voice steeped in hatred like acid. &#34;Verena,you&#39;ve played this move well. Over the next month,I&#39;lI arrange a team to keep him under constant watch.He won&#39;t be able to lift a finger without us knowing.At the same time, I&#39;ll personally take charge at the company and conduct a thorough sweep to uncover his accomplices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze fixed back on her, weighted with concern.&#34;Sherwood is cunning. Be careful when you treat him;don&#39;t let him suspect anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena met his eyes and answered with a calm,reassuring smile, &#34;I understand. Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t act rashly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a knock sounded at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced toward it and rose to her feet. &#34;You should get back to work. I&#39;ll be leaving now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis gave a small nod. &#34;Take care on the road.&#34;</p>
