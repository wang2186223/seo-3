                <p>After finishing the treatment session, Verena carefully carried out a series of examinations on Marisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the checkup ended, a wave of relief washed over Verena, and a gentle smile appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked over to Joseph and whispered,&#34;Dad,with me back to Mom&#39;s side, I can see faint signs of improvement. Right after the therapy, her mood steadied, and her once-erratic pulse has begun to find its rhythm again. That&#39;s a good omen-the treatment is working.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph, caught between surprise and joy, nodded slowly. &#34;That&#39;s wonderful. To see your mother regaining strength-it&#39;s a blessing. Verena, treating her illness must weigh heavily on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena clasped his hand and answered warmly, &#34;Dad,please don&#39;t say that. It&#39;s my duty, and more than that -it&#39;s what I want to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood, wearing a smile that looked both gratified and admiring, stepped forward. &#34;Verena&#39;s skills are truly remarkable. Such swift progress! Joseph, with her tending to Marisa, I daresay recovery won&#39;t be farff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>et, behind his words, a fleeting shadow stirred in his yes-a shadow unnoticed by Joseph and Luis, who vere both too absorbed in relief to catch it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Verena&#39;s phone rang. Glancing at the screen,she was surprised to see Miranda&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated briefly, and then looked toward Joseph.&#34;Dad, it&#39;s a call from a friend. I should take this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph smiled warmly. &#34;Go on, Verena. A call from a friend is not something one should ignore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a nod, she stepped out to the open-air balcony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night breeze drifted past, playful as a child,brushing her hair aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swiped the screen and greeted softly, &#34;Hello,Miranda,what&#39;s the matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Miranda&#39;s slightly husky voice asked,&#34;Verena, is Luis with you? If he is, could you pass the phone to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s brow arched with amusement. A mischievous smile tugged at her lips. &#34;Miranda, don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve gone and fallen head over heels for him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moonlight toyed with her expression, lending her a playful glow. Resting against the railing,she let s punquiet chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>teils lence fell before Miranda replied with mock oyance, &#34;Oh, stop teasing! Just hand him the )enine, or I&#39;ll truly be cross with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>sbuey</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ghing lightly, Verena straightened.&#34;Alright,alright.nenld on a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1.bn</p>
                
                
                
                <p>e turned back toward the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>2 9r e group drifted into lighthearted conversation,Jices weaving together in a gentle hum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JUO</p>
                
                
                
                <p>larisa,half-reclined on the sofa,would now and then b≤2ta smile bloom as the television show coaxed her ttention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph and Sherwood were chatting idly on the other 。couch; Luis and Isaac were locked in a chess match,their words mingling with strategy; while Molly,phone b in hand, seemed distracted-her eyes kept straying toward Luis,betraying her pretense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping forward,Verena gently tapped Luis&#39; shoulder,offering him the phone with a smile. &#34;Luis, Miranda wants a word with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, Molly&#39;s feigned calmness shattered-her gaze lifted sharply, her heartbeat quickening as if drums were playing in her chest. She watched Luis  th anxious intensity, hungry for every flicker of his action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>e had expected him to refuse. Yet, after the riefest hesitation, Luis accepted the phone and ralked with Verena back to the balcony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>6(e)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aolly&#39;s eyes followed his retreating figure, her heart tangle of emotions she could neither name nor (117tangle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ijLuis stood outside, one hand tucked casually in his npocket as the night air brushed his brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hn a level tone, he spoke into the phone. &#34;Miss Brown,what can I do for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s playful voice drifted through. &#34;Can&#39;t I call you without a reason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; lips curved faintly. &#34;Usually, people call for a reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought she would continue bantering,but her voice shifted, carrying a note of gravity laced with frustration. &#34;Luis, I&#39;m sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed; he was ready to respond, but she interrupted with languid mischief. &#34;It&#39;s lovesickness-andI need your kiss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were drawn-out, drenched with teasing triumph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For an instant, Luis&#39; composure cracked. His gaze lifted toward the endless dark ský, brows arched in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re drunk,&#34; he said-not as a question, but asa fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice-so·like that fateful night-made it impossible for him to forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft, tipsy laugh slipped through the receiver.&#34;Yes,I&#39;m drunk. But no one came to fetch me. What am I supposed to do,Luis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The playful grievance in her voice, tinged with warmth,carried across the line like an ember refusing to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; gaze sharpened, his lips pressed into a thin line.&#34;Are you still at the party venue?&#34; he asked, already pulling his phone from his pocket, his fingers sliding to his contacts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you coming to get me?&#34; she murmured,intoxication seeping through her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, after a pause, she giggled suddenly. &#34;I&#39;m teasing.The driver&#39;s already brought me to the hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis froze, his hand lingering mid-air above the screen. Once again, she had toyed with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pocketed his phone with a quiet sigh, eyes narrowing. &#34;Miss Brown, your gift for mischief only sharpens with time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reply was slurred, yet sincere in its resignation.&#34;It&#39;s the only way that works on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little distance away, Verena leaned against the far railing. The dim moonlight traced Luis&#39; profile,his face unreadable-yet, for the briefest heartbeat, she thought she saw the corner of his lips lift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It vanished as quickly as it appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Verena was certain she hadn&#39;t imagined it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought drew a smile from her as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena,&#34; a voice called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned. Molly was approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s smile lingered. &#34;Miss Kirk, what brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brushing a stray lock of hair from her face, Molly answered softly, &#34;I noticed you standing alone.I thought I&#39;d join you. The night is beautiful, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped beside Verena, both of them gazing  skyward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded politely. &#34;Yes. The moon is lovely tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush fell. Then Molly, unable to keep her thoughts caged, lowered her head and confessed, &#34;Verena,there&#39;s something I must apologize for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice trembled with guilt as she stood, shoulders squared but spirit burdened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena raised her brow, curiosity sparking, and regarded her with quiet interest.</p>
