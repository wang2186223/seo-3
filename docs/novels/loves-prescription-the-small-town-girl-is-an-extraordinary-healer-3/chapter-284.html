            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>A nurse, swift and efficient, handed over a sterile gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena accepted it with practiced calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her head, slid her arms smoothly through the sleeves, and then straightened the collar and hem with precise movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The process was seamless-without a pause, as natural as breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, even as her hands moved, her ears stayed sharp, catching every word as Huxley outlined the case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The patient was in a car crash--limbs bear only scrapes, nothing grave. The real wound lies in the head.Glass shattered, shards pierced the skull-several large pieces are lodged inside. It&#39;s a hard case,&#34; Huxley said gravely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s brows drew together, questions spilling like a quickened stream. &#34;Where exactly are the shards?How deep? Any sign of intracranial bleeding? And the patient&#39;s level of consciousness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adjusting his glasses, Huxley admired her sharpness and repied without delay, &#34;The fragments sit in the right hemisphere. Depth runs about an inch. There&#39;s minor intracranial bleeding, but no major hematoma yet. The patient&#39;s in a coma but reacts to pain stimuli. Vitals hold, though not steady-blood pressure and heart rate fluctuate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stopping before the OR doors, Verena lifted her head, her gaze firm. With a calm, steady voice, she nodded,saying,&#34;Alright. I have a clear enough picture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan followed behind, hollow-eyed, like a man carrying the weight of the world, from office to operating room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His steps faltered; his gaze was vacant, each movement dragging as though chained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, two images clashed: the girl&#39;s dimpled smile, and the imagined wreck that had torn it away.His chest tightened as though an invisible fist had clenched around his heart, stealíng his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena was about to enter, but catching Ivan&#39;s state, she turned back to his shattered figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone softened, steady as a hand on troubled waters. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;H do everything I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan moistened his pale, cracked lips, nodding stiffly, a puppet barely held by strings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his gaze lifted-eyes swimming with helplessness and desperate plea. His voice rasped. &#34;I trust you.You have to save her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight struck at Verena&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But doctors know better than to hand out absolute verdicts. False hope is poison, despair a double-edged blade, and promises unkept cut deepest of all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she sighed gently, her gaze earnest. &#34;Ivan, I&#39;ll give it everything I have. But medicine is riddled with uncertainty-things may turn at any moment. I can&#39;t give you an absolute promise. Yet as long as there&#39;s a thread of hope, I won&#39;t let go. You, too, must brace yourself-for whatever comes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan&#39;s lips trembled. Words clung to his throat, but only a broken whimper slipped free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands dangled weakly, fingers twitching in spasms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At length, he nodded slowly, as though surrendering the last of his strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once carefree, now crushed to fragments-his ruin made Verena&#39;s heart clench. Yet as a doctor, precision was her creed; every word had to bear its weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her lips, said no more, slipped on her mask, and pushed through the OR doors. The doors sealed shut, the red &#34;In Surgery&#34; light glowing above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan stood frozen, staring, as though his soul had been left on the other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his knees gave way, sliding down the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crouched low, his hands covered his face, muffled sobs leaking through trembling fingers. His shoulders heaved, soft cries echoing faintly through the empty corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Passing nurses and waiting families cast pitying glances, but lvan saw none of them. He was drowned in grief, his tears slipping through his hands and darkening the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, cold light washed the OR.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena took up the scalpel with precision, incising the scalp, the nurses quick at her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her every move was steady, caIculated, sparing blood and sparing trauma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the shards came into sight, lodged deep in fragile brain tissue, sweat gathered on her brow-but her gaze did not falter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clamped each fragment with forceps, easing it out bit by bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time itself seemed suspended-only the beeping machines and her measured breath filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, after long and grueling labor, every shard was removed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing her dry lips, she moved forward-suturing, stopping blood, repairing what damage she could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the final stitch was tied, she exhaled deeply, one hand bracing her aching waist as she stepped back</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the nurses, catching sight of her belly, rushed close. &#34;Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded slightly. &#34;I&#39;mn fine. I&#39;ll leave the follow-up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,she walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the &#34;In Surgery&#34; light dimmed, and Ivan&#39;s heart lurched again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze was fixed on the doors. The instant Verena appeared, he sprang forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood before her-eyes red, lips trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to speak, but his throat locked, words piling like stones behind silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him, Verena patted his shoulder lightly. &#34;It&#39;s okay-she&#39;s out of immediate danger. But waking will depend on her willpower.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Ivan&#39;s taut nerves unraveled. His whole frame buckled, strength deserting him in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena caught him quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Isaac arrived in haste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands froze on the wheels, his eyes locking onto the two pressed close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze flickered-worry, doubt, and beneath it all, jealousy&#39;s bitter fire, seeing Verena so near another man.</p>
