                <p>Danica stood drifting in her own thoughts and didn&#39;t notice the door moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda stepped out of the kitchen holding a dish.When she spotted Isaac coming in, she gave him a warm smile. &#34;Mr. Bennett, you&#39;re back earlier than usual. Your mother came by to wait for you. I just need to finish two more dishes, and then everything will be ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set the dish down on the table and quickly disappeared into the kitchen again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of Rhonda&#39;s voice jolted Danica back to reality. At some point, the small packet of powder she was holding had torn open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic hit her, and she tried to fold the packet closed before slipping it into her pocket. Her hands shook so badly that a faint sprinkle of white dust fell across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing herself to smile, Danica turned towardIsaac.&#34;Rough day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had remained there for some time, his gaze fixed  on her as she handled the packet. A cold heaviness slowly settled in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered joking with Verena the night before,never once thinking his words might come true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His stare locked on his mother, and disappointment colored his tone. &#34;Mom, you&#39;d rather side with Katelyn -even if it means working with her against me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All color drained from Danica&#39;s face. She shook her head,terrified by the thought of what he believed.&#34;No, Isaac, that&#39;s not true. I didn&#39;t place my trust in Katelyn to hurt you. I believed her because she&#39;s Evelyn, the most renowned surgeon here and abroad.Everything I&#39;ve done has always been for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she had fallen for Katelyn&#39;s pretty lies told Isaac that arguing further was pointless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hoping to avoid more conflict,he lowered his voice.&#34;Mom, go home. I can&#39;t look at you right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression carried a disappointment that pierced her heart. Fearful of losing him completely, she stepped closer. &#34;Isaac, please believe me. I could never harm you. I admit I went along when Katelyn swore she could cure you. She told me if I slipped you the drug, you&#39;d pass out, and then she could restrain you for surgery. At first I agreed. But after the way you treated her yesterday, I realized she no longer meant  you well. Once I understood that, I couldn&#39;t follow through. I swear I never intended to drug you. Just trust me this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s brow tightened, and he refused to listen further. &#34;Rhonda,take her out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac gave the command, Rhonda stepped out of the kitchen. She sensed the heavy atmosphere and wanted to ask, but she kept her thoughts to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she walked forward politely and motioned toward the door.&#34;Mrs. Bennett, let me take you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears gathered in Danica&#39;s eyes. She opened her mouth to explain, yet the words never formed. Left without a choice, she turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Danica returned home, her phone buzzed,and the name &#34;Katelyn&#34; flashed across the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Bennett, did it all go according to plan?&#34;Katelyn&#39;s voice carried a thrill she couldn&#39;t hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That burst of excitement confirmed everything for Danica. Katelyn never wanted to heal lsaac-she wanted payback.The surgery had only been an excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization left Danica chilled to the bone. If she hadn&#39;t woken up to the truth in time, she might have  walked her son straight into danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While fear lingered, her heart burned with resentment toward Katelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katelyn, I can&#39;t continue with this,&#34; Danica said with resolve. &#34;Isaac and I are already fallingapart because of Verena. If I deceive him again, there won&#39;t be anything left to repair between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s voice snapped, her patience breaking. &#34;So you&#39;re quitting? Are you seriously saying your ties with Isaac outweigh his chance at recovery? Don&#39;t you remember what we&#39;re working toward? Once he&#39;s able to walk again, he&#39;lI see you were acting out of love.How could you even consider giving up now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words grew sharper, carrying the tone of a scolding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica stood frozen, shaken to her core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her doubts finally hardened into certainty. Katelyn&#39;s urgency had nothing to do with Isaac&#39;s health. She was scrambling, terrified of losing her chance, and that alone proved her true motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After her outburst, the silence on Danica&#39;s end stretched too long. Only then did Katelyn realize she had gone too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s hesitation told Katelyn that her suspicions  might already be growing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So what if Danica had doubts?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One mention of Evelyn&#39;s name would tear down her resistance. After all, nobody else in the world could repair Isaac&#39;s legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn swallowed her frustration and forced her voice into something·calm, though her words carried an edge. &#34;Never forget that I&#39;m the only one who can treat Isaac. I&#39;m the leading expert in this field, and no one else can make the promises I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave the silence a moment to stretch, making sure the weight of her words settled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she struck again. &#34;Think it through. Would you rather cling to Isaac&#39;s wounded pride, or do you want him to stand and live like everyone else? You already know which answer matters most.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone carried an air of superiority that scraped at Danica&#39;s nerves, yet she couldn&#39;t deny the truth in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the day of the accident, she had searched for doctors far and wide. Every attempt ended in disappointment. Only Evelyn&#39;s name surfaced with hope attached to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when it came to complete recovery, only Katelyn spoke with certainty. But now that things had reached this point, trusting Katelyn any longer felt like stepping into a trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica would rather see Isaac remain in a wheelchair than gamble with his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, medical breakthroughs werealways happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn might be unmatched today, but someone new could appear tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, regret clung to her, weighing her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy sigh, she gave the weakest excuse she could think of. &#34;I&#39;m not feeling well. We&#39;ll talk later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ended the call before Katelyn could get another word in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn tried to speak, but the abrupt busy tone silenced her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her temper exploded. She flung the phone to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pieces scattered as it broke apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breathing hard, she clenched her fists until her knuckles gave a sharp crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation had shifted-using Danica as her way in  was no longer possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another pawn would have to take her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she considered her options, one name surfaced in her mind-Kaia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought disgusted her. She despised relying on that foolish girl, but at the moment, there was no one else she could use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s devotion to Verena ran too deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So be it. If he insisted on protecting her, then Katelyn would drag Verena&#39;s reputation through the dirt in Shoildon until the entire city turned against her. Let Isaac try to keep loving her after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image made Katelyn&#39;s lips curl into a cold smile.She flipped open her laptop and pulled up the chat app.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers moved quickly as she sent a message,saying, &#34;Kaia, I&#39;ve got a job for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s reply came right away. &#34;What kind of job?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spread this news everywhere you can. The wider it goes, the better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her files, Katelyn retrieved the foreign report about Verena that she had kept for this moment.She attached it and sent it to Kaia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s eyes widened in surprise before an eager grin spread across her face.</p>
