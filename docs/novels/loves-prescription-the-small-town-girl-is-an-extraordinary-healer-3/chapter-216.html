                <p>While Verena waited quietly on a bench outside, Isaac and Simon entered the therapy room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the door closed, the two men sat across from one another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s eyes drifted briefly to Isaac&#39;s legs, a faint trace of mockery flashing beneath his calm expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, he fixed his eyes on lsaac and spoke in a soothing tone. &#34;There&#39;s no need to be uneasy, Mr.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bennett. Life has handed you a challenge, but with my guidance, you&#39;ll be back on your feet soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inwardly, Simon sneered at the idea of Isaac being back on his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His real intentions were hardly so benevolent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle squint tightened Isaac&#39;s gaze, sharpening it with a hawk-like intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that split second, he sharply registered the very first glance cast toward his legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As someone used to navigating the business world&#39;s dangers, Isaac had learned long ago to trust his instincts; he&#39;d encountered plenty of people who didn&#39;t wish him well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew he hadn&#39;t imagined that glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A genuine professional would never be so blatant,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Psychologists typically made an effort to avoid focusing on a patient&#39;s disability, knowing how sensitive those wounds could be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For someone already in a fragile state, that kind of behavior would feel like pouring salt on an open wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac quickly sensed that the therapist seated across from him was behaving strangely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a courteous nod, Isaac kept his suspicions hidden. &#34;Thank you for your help, Dr. Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s smile faltered just a touch. &#34;If you&#39;re ready, let&#39;s get started.&#34; He leaned forward, folding his hands atop the table and locking eyes with lsaac. &#34;Tell me, how did your injury happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s voice stayed steady. &#34;It was a car crash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon let out a light laugh. &#34;Would you mind sharing more? Who else was in the car? What injuries did everyone sustain? And how were you feeling in the moment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He maintained a polished, gentlemanly air, but the chill in his eyes never faded, a coolness that hinted at something hidden beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one understood it more clearly than lsaac did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s line of questioning was nothing more than an attempt to poke at his wounds and watch him flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That alone was enough to put lsaac on high alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew when to trust his gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any psychologist worth their salt wouldn&#39;t push a patient toward discomfort o shame in their very first meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If someone did, it was a sign they shouldn&#39;t be trusted with anyone&#39;s care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though it was his first experience with psychological treatment, Isaac had a fair grasp of how it worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reputable doctor would begin a session by asking questions that are provocative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even someone just starting out would know better, let alone a professional at Evelyn Model Hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up with a steady gaze and answered, &#34;I saw it all happen. The driver died instantly. My father passed away right next to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words were delivered with such composure that they offered nothing for Simon to latch onto.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Simon tried to dig deeper. &#34;Your father&#39;s death was right before your eyes. What exactly was happening then? What was going through your mind?&#34; As Simon recalled the car accident and what lsaac had been through, something almost gleeful flickered beneath his calm surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s stare never wavered, cold and inscrutable, filling the room with a silent threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That unsettling gaze snapped Simon out of his self-indulgence. He took a quick glance at the nearby monitor, suddenly aware his tactics were crossing the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a practiced smile, he shifted the conversation. &#34;Or maybe... let&#39;s talk about your relationship with your father.What was it like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s usually unreadable expression softened for a moment.&#34;We were close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon didn&#39;t let up. &#34;So, since the accident, you&#39;re refusing to acknowledge reality? You won&#39;t accept either your father&#39;s death or your own condition?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes dropped, his lips pressed together in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon pulled an old-fashioned pocket watch from the drawer, the kind often used in traditional hypnosis.&#34;If you won&#39;t talk, Mr. Bennett, then let your dreams speak for you. Facing your pain is the only way to break through those mental barriers and speed up your recovery.&#34; He held the pocket watch in front of Isaac, his voice slipping into a slow, soothing rhythm. &#34;Keep your eyes on the watch. Just relax, and let your attention follow its movement. Imagine yourself sinking into a comfortable chair at the end of a long day. As the watch swings, your breathing slows, your muscles unwind,and your mind quiets down... You can trust me. Your father wouldn&#39;t want you to stay trapped like this...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He repeated these calming phrases, but Isaac&#39;s gaze never wavered. His eyes remained sharp and clear,showing no sign of slipping into hypnosis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Isaac&#39;s resistance, Simon&#39;s expression hardened for å moment. It was obvious Isaac wasn&#39;t about to let his guard down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Isaac refused to cooperate, Simon could use that as an opportunity to linger around Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After setting aside the pocket watch, Simon straightened up and addressed Isaac. &#34;Excuse me. I&#39;ll step out for a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the door opening made Verena glance up, expecting the session to be finished, but only Simon emerged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly asked, &#34;Dr. Moss, how is my husband doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a regretful sigh, Simon answered, &#34;Evelyn, your husband hasn&#39;t opened up to me. That makes the treatment especially difficult. Right now, it&#39;s essential that I earn his trust. If I could spend more time with your family, I might gain a better understanding of his situation and his real feelings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena,knowing how guarded Isaac could be, asked for more.&#34;Dr. Moss, what would you recommend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have an unconventional suggestion,&#34; Simon replied, deliberately letting a few seconds pass before continuing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena urged him on, &#34;Please, go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He adopted an apologetic tone. &#34;If you&#39;re willing, I&#39;d like to stay at your home for a while. This intensive approach means I&#39;ll be close to the patient around the clock. Living together would help me observe his mental state in real time, giving me a chance to understand him and offer more comprehensive care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such arrangements weren&#39;t ancommon for certain therapies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a clinical standpoint, living with the patient allowed for constant observation and timely interventions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotionally, it could build trust and improve communication, which often sped up recovery and led to better results.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena considered the idea, but with clear caution. &#34;I&#39;ll need to check with Isaac first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s comfort and willingness mattered most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing this arrangement on him would only create more problems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon nodded with a faint, courteous smile.&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That ended the session for the day. Back in the hospital room, Verena relayed Simon&#39;s proposal to Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t say yes or no. Instead, he looked right at Verena and said quietly, &#34;That man is hostile toward me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took Verena a few seconds to piece together who he was referring to, and a frown crossed her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you saying Dr. Moss has something against you?&#34; she asked, a note of uncertainty in her voice. &#34;Did something happen between you two before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gave a firm shake of his head. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to reassure him, Verena smiled and gently cupped his face in her hands. &#34;Maybe you&#39;re reading into things too much. Dr. Moss went through every step of our vetting process, my assistant double-checked all his qualifications, and everything checked out. He&#39;s highly respected in his field. Maybe it&#39;s just your nerves making you extra cautious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Isaac couldn&#39;t shake his gut feeling. &#34;I&#39;ve never crossed paths with him before. But I&#39;m telling you,there&#39;s something about him. Maybe it has to do with you. Verena, sometimes a man can sense another man&#39;s true intentions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the first moment he had met Simon, Isaac sensed an undercurrent of animosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He became even more certain when he caught that quick, assessing look Simon gave his legs during their session.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena sat up straighter, sifting through her memories as she tried to recall any meeting with Simon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few moments, she shook her head. &#34;I can&#39;t think of any past interactions with him. We only met at his interview. I kept my identity private until I treated Maxton, and I hardly ever appear in public. Even if he admired my work, that wouldn&#39;t explain any hostility toward you, would it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lifted his gaze to her, a faint crease in his brow. &#34;Verena, do you doubt my judgment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena dropped her eyes and grew quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if it seemed far-fetched for Simon to have a grudge, she couldn&#39;t ignore how uncomfortable Isaac felt. It wasn&#39;t normal for a patient to put up walls with a psychologist right from the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe his suspicion was justified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled herself together, noticing the troubled look on Isaac&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle touch, she rested her hand on his shoulder and leaned in to whisper,&#34;Don&#39;t look so worried.You&#39;re my husband, and I trust your judgment most. I&#39;ll quietly dig into his background and find you another doctor if you want. How does that sound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her quiet promise soothed him, and Isaac&#39;s expression softened, his lips curving into a genuine smile.</p>
