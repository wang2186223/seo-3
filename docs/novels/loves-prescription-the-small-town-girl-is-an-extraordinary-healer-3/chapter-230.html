                <p>Night swallowed the city whole, and the wind howled through the streets like a warning bell. A sudden downpour struck, sending pedestrians scattering for shelter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>High above, on the top floor of a towering high-rise,rain pounded the windows in relentless waves, each impact sharp as musket fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, a single floor lamp burned dimly in the living room, its hazy glow wrapping the room in a murky gloom that blurred the line between shadow and substance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thunder split the heavens,lightning flooded the room,revealing takeout boxes cluttering the coffee table, a trash bin spilling over, flies circling above it like vultures waiting on decay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon sat motionless on the couch in a striped shirt,a dagger spinning lazily between his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His stare clung to a photograph on the table-the face in it was Isaac&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint flickered in his eyes, cold and cruel, while the  corner of his mouth lifted with the ghost of a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, he picked up the phone and dialed a number so feared, most men would never dare breathe it aloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waited. At last, the line clicked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep, glacial voice filled his ear. &#34;If I recall, our deal is over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No greeting. Only menace-like a devil rising straight from the pit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, Simon wouldn&#39;t have dreamed of making this call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But tonight was different. Fear no longer lived in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips curved, chilling and deliberate. &#34;Mr. Sampson,of course our deal is done. But this call is for something else-something greater. A piece of news that will astonish you... and I promise, it won&#39;t disappoint.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Far away, Luis Sampson leaned back in his chair, black trench coat draped loosely, a half-burned cigar between his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He squinted, silence holding for several beats before his voice uncoiled, slow and mocking. &#34;Is that so?  Then speak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s tone hardened, every word deliberate.&#34;You&#39;ve searched for your sister for over ten years.I can tell you now-I know where she is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, Luis surged to his feet. His eyes blazed, long -buried emotions tearing free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is she?&#34; His voice trembled, urgency cracking through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet even then, discipline pulled at his reins. &#34;How do you know? Ten years without a trace-and suddenly you claim certainty?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this, Simon&#39;s chuckle slid low and dark. &#34;Mr.Sampson, not all things can be explained. You scoured the world with empty hands, and I found her without even meaning to. Sometimes, fate mocks us with coincidence. And as for your sister-l&#39;d never dare joke. Not with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis narrowed his gaze, knowing Simon wouldn&#39;t dare lie-not unless he longed for the grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, he sank back into his chair. The thought of his long-lost sister-the family he had longed for through years of sleepless nights-now dangled before him,setting his blood alight with hope. &#34;Where is she?&#34; His voice cracked again, hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is my sister now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon could taste the hunger in his words. His gamble was taking root.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted the dagger, letting its edge glint against the dim light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want her?&#34; His smile warped into something feral. &#34;Then help me topple a man. We&#39;ll settle details face-to-face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence followed. Only static whispered faintly through the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Simon to demand such terms meant one thing: he was certain Luis would accept. After all, this was the sister he had chased through more than ten relentless years. Everyone knew-his sister was the one chink in his armor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon savored the moment, convinced the whole chessboard was his to command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Luis drew slowly on his cigar, and then released a perfect ring of smoke that floated upward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The haze curled around his features, blurring them,sharpening the authority in his posture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chin lifted slightly, eyes glinting with lethal frost.Each word dripped with death&#39;s certainty-and none who knew him doubted. He never bluffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Simon held his ground. Madness burned in his stare; his mouth twisted into a grin that bordered on delirium.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His laughter ripped through the room, jagged and shrill, a sound that scraped bone. Tears welled up in his eyes before he fell still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I know.&#34; Simon&#39;s bloodshot eyes dropped to the photo on the table. &#34;By day, Mr. Sampson,you&#39;re the polished head of a glittering jewelry empire.By night, you rule the underworld with an iron hand-merciless and absolute. If I dare threaten you,it is because I no longer fear death, nor the hell you command. I desire only one thing...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a savage thrust, he drove the dagger through Isaac&#39;s photo. &#34;Help me annihilate Isaac Bennett. Wipe him out so completely that not even his bones remain.Do that-and you&#39;ll see your sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low chuckle slipped from his lips. &#34;Refuse? Then take my life-l welcome it. But know this: your sister vanishes forever. For a man who has nothing left to lose, threats are weightless. Bribery, however, works. And you, Mr. Sampson, are wise enough to see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Luis crushed his cigar out,jaw clenched hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon was pressing on the one wound he could never ignore-his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without this trump card, if Simon dared to threaten him like this, his -corpse would already be cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long silence, Luis rose, sliding his hands into the deep pockets of his coat. His eyes turned to ice,his tone deadly calm. &#34;I&#39;ll hear you out. Face-to-face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ended the call. Then, with a flicker of command,he told the shadow behind him, &#34;We&#39;re going back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On Simon&#39;s side, once he heard the words, he hurled the phone aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the dimness, his lips curled slowly, a cruel light kindling in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, silence ruled. Then a low, eerie laugh crawled from his throat, thick with malice and triumph -as if a demon had been set loose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, thunder roared, rattling the windows,yet his laughter rose higher, nearly drowning the storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lightning cleaved the sky, flashing across hisface-  half shadow, half glare-turning him monstrous,his eyes wide and predatory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, one refrain repeated endlessly-Isaac Bennett,your end is near.</p>
