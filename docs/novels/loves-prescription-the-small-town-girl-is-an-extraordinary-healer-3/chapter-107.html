                <p>That morning, before lsaac had left for the office,Verena had told him she would be staying at her new villa with her friend for the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t expected him to call at such an hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena darted to the open-air balcony to answer,her lips curving playfully. &#34;We really do share a telepathic bond,don&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had been lying in bed for quite some time, but sleep refused to come. He picked up a book from the bedside table, turned its pages, and stared at the words for nearly half an hour-yet not a single sentence sank in. Every page only mirrored Verena&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After wrestling with his thoughts, he finally chose to call her. He hadn&#39;t truly hoped she would pick up, yet,to his surprise, she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back against the headboard, Isaac sounded a little taken aback. &#34;Were you thinking of me too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena didn&#39;t reply directly. Instead, she parried with a question of her own. &#34;And you? What was it tha  kept me in your thoughts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her voice poured through the receiver, Isaac absentmindedly toyed with the corner of his book. &#34;I was wondering if you were nervous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resting against the railing, Verena smiled.&#34;Funny,my friend just asked me the very same thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His curiosity sharpened. &#34;And what was your answer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dodged again, throwing the ball back into his court.&#34;Are you nervous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t chase her evasions. He let the silence stretch a moment before admitting with a faint smile,&#34;A little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s grin grew wider at his words, echoing her own heart, her eyes shimmering beneath the bright moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She teased him lightly, &#34;It&#39;s all right. If nerves get the better of you tomorrow, just hide behind me. I&#39;ll take the lead. I don&#39;t mind being the woman who calls the shots.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheerful laughter rippled through the line, and Isaac couldn&#39;t help but be carried along by her joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a spell of lighthearted chatter, Verena grew playful again. &#34;So, how&#39;s it going without me tonight? Darling,are you lonely and restless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,silence fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena frowned, thinking he might have hung up,but a glance at the screen showed that the call was still connected.Why no sound?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, after a good ten seconds, Isaac&#39;s low voice reached her. &#34;Tomorrow night, I won&#39;t be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew full well she didn&#39;t care for him as much as he longed for, but still he couldn&#39;t resist her teasing and sweet words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Verena could gather her thoughts, he added,&#34;Get some sleep. Goodnight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until the busy tone echoed in her ear that she snapped back to herself. Wait... what had he just said?Tomorrow night, he wouldn&#39;t be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her cheeks burning, Verena pressed her hands to her face, wondering if those bold words had truly come from Isaac. Since when had he grown so smooth-tongued?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Isaac lowered his phone and placed a palm over his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The simple question Verena had tossed at him had sparked a blaze there, and the fire refused to die down.  What unsettled him most was his own heartbeat,hammering so hard it seemed almost loud enough for her to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In those long seconds of silence, he truly feared that Verena might have caught the frantic rhythm of his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat still against the headboard,waiting for the storm in his chest to quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was utterly silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, after a long pause, his voice-low and hoarse -slipped into the stillness. &#34;Calm down...stop beating so fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Otherwise,the groom who stood before her tomorrow would look less like a young man in love and more like a weary,worn one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Verena finished breakfast with Miranda, just as the makeup artists arrived promptly at seven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With their skilled hands, Verena and Miranda changed into their wedding gown and bridesmaid dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda gave Verena a long look, admiration sparkling in her eyes. &#34;Girl, you look breathtaking.&#34; Verena raised a brow and shot back with candor,&#34;You&#39;re just as breathtaking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each woman had her own artist, which sped up the process considerably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villa had been transformed the day before-balloons brightened the ceilings, roses lined the paths,and every corner seemed drenched in festivity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the middle of this, Gavin arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re here so early?&#34; Verena asked in mild surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pouring water into their glasses, Gavin answered, &#34;Of course. I&#39;m here to back you up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you bring what I asked for?&#34; Miranda pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wouldn&#39;t dare forget it.&#34; Gavin slipped a small folded piece of paper from his jacket and handed it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to move much while her makeup was underway, Verena glanced at Miranda through the mirror.&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s reflection offered only a mysterious smile.&#34;You&#39;ll find out soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That smile set Verena on edge. With such secrecy,trouble was sure to follow. By nine, both were ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the wedding gown was cumbersome, Miranda helped Verena upstairs to the bedroom,with Gavin trailing behind to carry the train.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three chatted until Miranda checked the time.&#34;The groom should be here any minute. Gavin, go see if they&#39;ve arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On it.&#34; Gavin nodded and stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, he burst back in, excitement spilling over as he shut the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re here! Just reaching the front gates!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Miranda swiftly pulled Verena&#39;s veil over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came footsteps outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three sharp knocks, followed by a lively voice.&#34;Beautiful bride, we&#39;ve come to take you to the ceremony. Come with your handsome groom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena immediately recognized Stevie&#39;s tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The groomsmen joined him, chanting in chorus,&#34;Beautiful bride, we&#39;ve come to take you to the ceremony.Come with your handsome groom!&#34; Miranda called back through the door, &#34;The bride won&#39;t walk out so easily. Not a drop of sincerity yet,and not even a glimpse of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, Gavin braced himself against the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stevie,prompted by Cayden, bargained from outside.&#34;At least let the bride say a word to the groom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena chuckled quietly, imagining Isaac keeping his silence,letting others do the clamoring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda crossed her arms with a smirk. &#34;We&#39;re the bride&#39;s guardians today. If you want her voice, you&#39;ll have to get through us first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guardians or not, at least let us see the bride!&#34; Slater demanded,pounding the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly, this isn&#39;t fair,&#34; Bobby chimed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin loosened his grip, leaning casually against the frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half in jest, he said, &#34;Bobby, this door won&#39;t yield so easily. I still remember those punches you gave me last time. Unless Isaac makes it up to me, neither he nor you will see the bride.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena knew Gavin was bluffing; he wouldn&#39;t truly bar the way. Besides, the groomsmen would find a way  around it, so she stayed quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda, however, blinked in surprise and turned to Verena. &#34;Hold on-what&#39;s this about? Gavin got beaten up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone grew excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena chuckled. &#34;I&#39;ll explain later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Isaac&#39;s amused voice sounded from the other side. &#34;I&#39;ll compensate-with interest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something thin and rigid slid under the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin bent to pick it up and blinked. It was a bank card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, that&#39;s generous!&#34; Gavin exclaimed,stunned.&#34;I was only teasing; no need for lsaac to get so worked up,right?&#34;</p>
