                <p>Thus,Kaia buried herself in books, fearing that, if she faltered, she would be discarded just as Verena once had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she grew old enough to understand the patterns,she began staging little &#34;coincidences&#34; to please her parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever they secured a business deal, her presence seemed to turn fortune in their favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then could she breathe easy, wearing the title of their lucky star, shielded from rejection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the day she learned Verena was being brought back, a storm of unease rose in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She feared her parents saw no more use in her, so they had gone to the countryside to reclaim Verena and groom her instead-preparing to abandon Kaia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That fear was why she had grown so anxious,why she schemed against Verena with such restless urgency, hoping to drive her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia admitted to herself at last: her hostility had been born not of malice, but of fear-fear of being replaced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet at the root of it all stood Alec and Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had they given her the same security they lavished on Luka, would she ever have fought so bitterly against Verena&#39;s return?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Kaia saw clearly: Verena&#39;s coldness toward her was merely the harvest of her own sowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she not struck first, Verena would never have retaliated. Every slight she suffered was but the echo of her own actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So often, when we dislike someone, we fail to trace back the cause and effect-until it is far too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Kaia knew Verena was Evelyn, her idol of many years, she understood everything in painful clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had not been wrong. She should never have been harmed. Grasping that truth, Kaia drew in a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, she realized, Katelyn had been nothing more than a manipulator using her as a pawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia had already erred too many times. She could not afford to carry the weight of a crime on top of her guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her gaze to the phone in her hand, she made a silent decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Verena returned home, Rhonda hurried toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a hushed voice, she said, &#34;Mrs. Bennett,your sister is here. I told her you weren&#39;t available, but she refused to leave and insisted on waiting. I didn&#39;t know what else to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since Kaia had moved out of Seraphina Villas,Isaac had instructed the staff to find excuses to turn her away if she ever appeared again. Verena cast a glance toward the living room, and then said softly, &#34;I understand. You may return to your work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda nodded and quietly went back to polishing the hallway railings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena walked toward Kaia, arms folded, eyes lowered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice came out cool and sharp. &#34;What&#39;s your purpose this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remained standing, deliberately refusing to sit,making it clear she had no intention of indulging in a drawn-out conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone dripped with sarcasm-words that, once upon a time, would have provoked Kaia into a fiery retort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, things had changed. This was Evelyn-her idol, the figure she had admired for years. How could she answer back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All Kaia could do was regret the wrongs she had done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting her lip, she whispered with remorse, &#34;Verena, I won&#39;t hurt you anymore...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words made Verena&#39;s stomach turn; disgust rippled through her like a sudden chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; won&#39;t waste another moment on this farce,&#34; she replied indifferently, turning toward the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic seized Kaia, and she blurted out, &#34;Evelyn wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stopped reflexively and turned her gaze upon her.11SO1you&#39;ve seen the news too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia nodded earnestly, speaking in a rush. &#34;Yes, l know you&#39;re Evelyn-that&#39;s why I have to warn you.Katelyn is plotting to kidnap you. Please, be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words tumbled out with urgency, her emotions laid bare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Verena only stared in silence, her eyes fixed on Kaia,offering nothing in return. Just as Kaia was about to repeat herself, Verena stepped closer, looming over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, she gave a cold chuckle. &#34;Kaia, you and Katelyn are working together. Do you really think I&#39;d swallow your lies? Rhonda, see her out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to leave without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Verena truly meant to walk away, Kaia&#39;s heart clenched. With no time left to think, she dropped to her knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda, startled, looked at Verena in confusion.&#34;Mrs.Bennett,she...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena frowned slightly at the sight. &#34;What performance is this now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s fists tightened at her sides, her head bowed low. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I admit it-I feared you&#39;d steal Mom and Dad&#39;s love, so I targeted you from the very beginning, trying to force you out. I came to you not just because you are Verena, but because you are Evelyn.&#34; She lifted her gaze, eyes brimming with sincerity.&#34;Because you&#39;re Evelyn, I cannot harm you-and I wvill :not let anyone else harm you either. You may doubt Verena&#39;s sister, but you cannot ignore Evelyn&#39;s fan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something flickered across Verena&#39;s eyes, though skepticism still lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her hesitation, Kaia spoke quickly, almost pleading. &#34;Do you remember a letter you received three years ago? The sender signed as &#39;Grace.&#39; I never imagined someone as remarkable as you would read it-let alone reply-but you did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three years ago, when Kaia was drowning in self-doubt, she had watched Luka bathe effortlessly in their parents&#39; love, while she struggled endlessly for scraps of affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pressure had gnawed at her, leaving her restless,sleepless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn had been her only refuge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing Evelyn was in a hospital in Clokron, Kaia had poured her pain into a letter and sent it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She confessed that she felt powerless,unloved-that her parents cherished only the &#34;luck&#34; she seemed to bring them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as time passed, she no longer knew how to create such lucky coincidences to prove her worth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had assumed someone as extraordinary as Evelyn would be buried in countless letters every day, and hers would vanish into the pile. She had never held out hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, one day...</p>
