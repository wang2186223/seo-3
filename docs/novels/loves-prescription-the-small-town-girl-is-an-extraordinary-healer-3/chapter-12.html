                <p>Isaac&#39;s voice rumbled low, carrying more frustration than he intended. &#34;How many times do you plan on gambling with your life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding the concern beneath the reprimand, Bobby dropped his gaze. &#34;I&#39;m sorry for making you worry. Mom&#39;s already had enough to bear... We shouldn&#39;t give her more to lose sleep over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, during the ride to the hospital, Isaac had already pressed for details and confirmed Bobby&#39;s injuries weren&#39;t serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since that severe car crash, Danica hadn&#39;t slept soundly once. He refused to pile more strain onto her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get some rest. I&#39;ll arrange for someone to bring you home later,&#34; Isaac said evenly. &#34;Leave Mom to me.I have work to deaI with at the company, so I&#39;ll head out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Isaac maneuvered his wheelchair toward the door, Bobby&#39;s mind flashed back to the aftermath of the accident. His hand shot out, gripping Isaac&#39;s arm. &#34;You absolutely can&#39;t marry Verena!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s jaw tightened. He didn&#39;t want to hear it. Given Bobby&#39;s condition, he kept his irritation in check. &#34;Let go,&#34; he instructed flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lack of reaction made Bobby&#39;s pulse jump. &#34;I&#39;m telling you the truth-Verena&#39;s no good. The Willis sisters are both trouble. One family doesn&#39;t raise two entirely different kinds of people. The ones who lie easily are the ones with the deepest schemes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recalling the elegant stranger he&#39;d seen that day, Bobby leaned forward urgently. &#34;Don&#39;t marry her.I already found the perfect woman for you! She&#39;s beautiful, kind... she saved me during the crash. Looked about your age too. From the moment I saw her, I knew she was the one who could match you. Too bad I didn&#39;t get her contact before the medics hauled me off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With unshakable certainty, Bobby finished his pitch. &#34;Isaac, just go to the Willis family and call off the arrangement. You should marry that incredible woman instead. I&#39;ll track her down for you, no matter what. So,what do you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Isaac, the suggestion sounded nothing short of reckless-naive, even childish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint chill settled in his eyes as he fixed Bobby with a steady stare. &#34;Who taught you to speak about a woman like this behind her back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of Isaac&#39;s glare robbed Bobby of his next words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The arrangement with the Willis family stands,&#34; Isaac said, voice cool and resolute. &#34;And I don&#39;t want to hear another word of this nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning his wheelchair toward the door, he paused as though remembering something. Without fully facing Bobby, he added, &#34;And for the record, Verena isn&#39;t the liar you make her out to be. She will be your sister-in-law, so you&#39;ll show her respect. In this family, we don&#39;t slander people in their absence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s tone carried enough authority to leave Bobby momentarily frozen. Only when the door clicked shut did he release the breath he&#39;d been holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, this was rich. What kind of game had Verena played to get lsaac on her side after meeting him only once?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought only fueled Bobby&#39;s resolve. No matter what it took, he would not allow Verena to marry Isaac.Now that he&#39;d found someone who truly matched his brother, there was no way he&#39;d back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Autumn&#39;s breath swept through the streets, scattering golden leaves until they lay thick over the pavement like a gilded carpet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Muted colors dulled the scenery, giving the city a quiet, almost somber air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside a warmly lit private dining room, two figures sat facing each other-a man and a woman separated by decades in age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man, nearing sixty, wore his years in the silver streaks along his temples and the faint creases at the corners of his eyes. Across from him sat Verena, poised and elegant, her hair flowing in a silky cascade down her back, her frame slender and composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A genial smile tugged at the man&#39;s lips. &#34;Evelyn, ever since we said goodbyes to each other in Clokron, I&#39;ve been trying to arrange another meeting. It seems this busy bee finally decided to grace me with her presence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was Wendell Branson, a distinguished professor at Acorith College of Medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their acquaintance began in Clokron, where they had collaborated on medical work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognizing the teasing note in his voice, Verena lifted her cup, her expression warm.&#34;It&#39;s true-personal matters have kept me away. I owe you an apology, Professor Branson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In those early Clokron days, Wendell&#39;s opinion of her had been far from favorable. Her aloof manner and quiet reserve had struck him as a sign of inexperience. But after the ordeal in Dragon Quarter, his view shifted completely. He no longer merely respected her-he admired her. Talented physicians of her age were exceedingly rare, and she was one of the few who stood out beyond doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a satisfied glint in his eyes, Wendell lifted his cup, letting it gently meet Verena&#39;s in a soft chime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelyn, we&#39;ve known each other long enough for me to skip the pleasantries,&#34; Wendell said warmly.&#34;I&#39;d like to extend an official invitation for you to deliver a lecture at our college.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The offer made Verena pause, her thoughts drifting for a moment. Shawna&#39;s death on her operating table still lingered like a shadow in her mind, and the occasional tremor in her hand reminded her it hadn&#39;t fully passed. Added to that, she&#39;d been pouring her energy into analyzing Isaac&#39;s condition, leaving little room for anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s voice held a trace of regret as she responded, &#34;Professor Branson, I truly appreciate the honor.But right now, I have a critical patient who needs my full attention. You understand that preparing for a lecture demands complete focus and precision. At present, I&#39;m overwhelmed. Once this treatment is complete,if your invitation still stands, I&#39;ll gladly accept and give it my all.&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell&#39;s smile deepened, his tone laced with good humor.&#34;Very well, I&#39;ll hold you to that. And if you dare refuse me then, I&#39;ll tell the whole world that the celebrated young doctor is making a fool of an old man.&#34; Verena gave a small nod, her voice steady. &#34;You have my promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer seemed to genuinely please Wendell. &#34;Alright then. Enjoy your meal. I&#39;ll step out for a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaving the private room, Wendell made his way toward the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the return walk, a voice rang out behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to see a young woman in a blue dress hurrying toward him, her face lighting up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Professor Branson, it really is you!&#34; Kaia exclaimed, practically bouncing with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell recognized her immediately as one of his most engaged students from Acorith College of Medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaia. I didn&#39;t expect to see you here. Are you having a meal here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of Bobby, she nodded with a shy smile. &#34;Yes, I&#39;m here with a friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then asked, &#34;And you, Professor? Are you dining alone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m with...&#34; Wendell hesitated for a couple of seconds, remembering Evelyn&#39;s preference for privacy.Guessing she wouldn&#39;t want to be mentioned, he said, &#34;...someone I look up to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;Someone you look up to? That must be someone truly remarkable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell smiled faintly. &#34;Extremely. In fact, one of the most talented young professionas I&#39;ve ever known.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eager to continue the conversation and leave a good impression, Kaia quickly said, &#34;That reminds me.I recently bought several medical books, and one of them was by my idol, Evelyn Rowe. Some of the terms and advanced theories are a bit beyond me. Would it be alright if I messaged you later for guidance?&#34;</p>
