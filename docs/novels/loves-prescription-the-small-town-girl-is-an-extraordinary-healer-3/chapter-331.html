                <p>Luis&#39; voice carried an urgency that broke through his usual calm, like a storm cloud suddenly splitting a clear sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick noticed Luis&#39; uncharacteristic tone but dared not probe, quickly replying, &#34;Yes, Mr. Sampson, the car will be ready shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis ended the call, rose to his feet, and strode toward the office door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His steps were brisk, and in his haste, the edge of his folder struck the desk corner with a sharp sound-yet he seemed blind to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Less than half an hour later, the car rolled to a smooth halt at the grand entrance of Serenity Hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doorman hurried forward, opening the door with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis stepped out and entered the lobby, his tall,upright figure mirrored on the gleaming marble floor,polished enough to double as glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads turned as he passed, but no one dared approach the aura of distance he carried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the reception desk,Luis leaned slightly forward,his brows faintly knitted. &#34;Which room is Miranda Brown staying in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda had already made arrangements. The receptionist, after a quick search, gave a professional smile and reported crisply, &#34;Mr. Sampson, Miss Brown is in Room 1608.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis inclined his head in acknowledgment, murmured thanks, and turned toward the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside,he pressed the button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the numbers above flickered toward his destination,his Adam&#39;s apple shifted with a trace of unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the elevator doors slid open, he stepped onto the corridor and halted at Room 1608. He raised his hand and pressed the bell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chime rang clearly in the silent hallway, yet nearly a minute ticked by without reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thought stirred in his mind, his brow twitching faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steeling himself, he was about to find staff for a keycard when the sound of the lock clicked behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned-and there was Miranda, framed in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hair was half-dry, loose strands clinging lightly to her cheeks, an air of unstudied ease about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wore a champagne silk robe, its sheen soft under the light, the collar carelessly open to show a glimpse of her collarbone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hem skimmed her knees, leaving her calves gracefully bare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; throat moved of its own accord, his lips parting to speak-yet Miranda was quicker. &#34;Sorry, I was in the shower and didn&#39;t hear you at first. Come in, and shut the door behind you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,she turned and walked back inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis hesitated a heartbeat, and then followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes swept the room discreetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the sofa lay a neatly folded blanket, untouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the coffee table, a few books lay open beside a steaming cup of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed no one else had come in here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here I sit, a dazzling woman in plain view, and you didn&#39;t spare me a glance when you walked in. That  stings a little, you know,&#34; Miranda teased, feigning a wounded tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Luis finally let his gaze rest on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had settled on the bed, hands resting lightly at her sides,legs crossed to reveal slender ankles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her posture was languid yet magnetic,drawing the eye without effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she shifted, the silk robe slid from her shoulder,revealing a patch of smooth skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda tilted her head,lips curved into a teasing smile,her gaze steady on Luis, unashamed in its allure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; breath faltered, his heartbeat stumbling against its rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had been right-Miranda was a fox in plain sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of Verena&#39;s words stirred a brief flash of irritation in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped forward, stopping before Miranda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tall frame loomed as he bent slightly, eyes locking with hers. Sparks flickered there, shadowed,making his feelings difficult to read. His lips parted, voice low, edged with teasing yet probing, &#34;Miss Brown, I heard you were so lonely tonight that if I didn&#39;t come, you&#39;d find another man instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What nonsense was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda blinked in surprise, innocence shining in her clear eyes. &#34;I only asked you to come meet me at the hotel. I never said anything like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence that followed spoke volumes-both realized Verena&#39;s words had been stretched beyond truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda was the first to recover, breaking into laughter. &#34;I should thank my dear friend for giving events a little push.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her chin, eyes sparkling with mischief,her tone languid yet provocative. &#34;So, Mr. Sampson, did you rush here out of jealousy? Seems you care for me more than you admit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her slender fingers slid along his tie, brushing lightly against his Adam&#39;s apple, a touch both casual and deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver shot through him, and a faint haze dimmed his sharp gaze. So close,he caught the mingled scent of her shower gel and her own fragrance-subtle yet intoxicating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis instinctively tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear,his Adam&#39;s apple bobbing as his gaze deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer, but his hand tilted her chin gently as he leaned closer, as if to claim her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s eyes sparkled with amusement; deftly,she leaned back, dodging him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips brushed her cheek instead, leaving a warm trace on her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The primal tide within him surged, and the brief setback only fanned the flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed a hand lightly on her shoulder,easing her back onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda sank into the mattress, its softness cradling her form as her hair spread across the silk sheets like a painter&#39;s stroke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis leaned over, his body caging hers, his stance unmistakably assertive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His long leg shifted, knee naturally parting her own,his hands planted firmly on either side, veins taut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence thickened, broken only by the drum of  their heartbeats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he drew closer, breath against breath, Miranda&#39;s lips curled into a sly smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a swift motion, she snatched the folder on the bed and pressed it against his chest, triumph flickering in her eyes. &#34;Sorry, Mr. Sampson. Strictly business today-no body talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis froze for a heartbeat, caught off guard, the embers of desire still smoldering in his gaze.</p>
