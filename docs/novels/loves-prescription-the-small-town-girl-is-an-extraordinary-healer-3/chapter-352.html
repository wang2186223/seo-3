            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>The emergency room was bathed in harsh white light,and the smell of disinfectant stung with every breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Isaac stepped out of the car, he scooped Verena into his arms and dashed through the hospital entrance, moving so fast that the air seemed to rush in his wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic clung to him. He shouted for help with a desperate urgency, his voice cracking under the weight of his fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nurses raced over with a gurney. Isaac lowered Verena onto it with shaky hands, his gaze glued to her pale,drained face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the nurses wheeled her into the examination room, Isaac&#39;s heart pounded so wildly that it felt as if it might burst. He stood frozen, gripped by a cold terror he&#39;d never known before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to keep still, he paced the corridor outside.Every step was frantic, restless, and he hardly noticed his own achievements slipping from his thoughts in the chaos. He kept stopping, staring at the examination room doors. His fists clenched so tightly that his knuckles stood out, white and bloodless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat gathered on his brow, rolling down his cheeks and soaking into his shirt collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each passing moment dragged on,slow and torturous,as if time itself wanted to punish him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of Verena groaning in pain wouldn&#39;t leave him. He ached with guilt, wishing he could take her place and spare her from suffering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like an eternity, the doors to the examination room finally creaked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac rushed forward as soon as he saw the doctor appear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to speak, but his throat felt raw and his words barely formed. &#34;Doctor, my wife-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor slipped off his mask and offered a gentle smile. &#34;You can relax. She&#39;s not in any real danger.The pain is from fatigue and stress, and it&#39;s affecting her digestion. The baby is doing great, and so is the mother. What she needs now is plenty of rest and a steady routine of nutritious meals to help her body bounce back smoothly.&#34;Relief swept through Isaac, loosening every tight muscle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew in a trembling breath, eyes shining with tears that threatened to spill, the exhaustion melting away as relief took over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After giving the doctor his heartfelt thanks, Isaac hurried off to see Verena in the ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena rested quietly in the hospital bed,her features still pale, but sleep finally granted her some peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving with care, Isaac eased himself into the chair beside her. He reached out and drew her hand to his cheek, holding it as if he never wanted to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have no idea how much you scared me,&#34; said Isaac,his voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat lost in thought, brushing his thumb over her knuckles with a kind of reverence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought I was going to lose you,&#34; he said,his words spilling out in a shaky breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beyond the glass, night gave way to a faint glow. The first strands of daylight crept across the floor,bringing the promise of a new morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac paid no mind to the rising sun or the changing  hour. He only wanted to stay by Verena&#39;s side, refusing to look away as if his watchfulness alone could shield her from harm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every now and then, he leaned in and pressed a gentle kiss to her brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When dawn turned into a brighter day, Verena stirred at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still half-asleep, she tried to stretch but found her right hand caught in a strong grip she couldn&#39;t shake free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wrinkled her brow and turned her head. That was when she saw Isaac beside her, slumped forward in the chair,chin tucked to his chest, deep in exhausted sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunlight fell across his face, smoothing away some of the sharpness in his features. Even so, the shadows beneath his eyes betrayed a long, sleepless night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must have stayed up the entire time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena glanced down, she finally noticed their fingers laced together. His hand dwarfed hers, and he was holding on as if afraid to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight sent warmth flooding through her chest,and a soft smile touched her lips before she even realized it. She lingered there, watching lsaac, not wanting to move and break the fragile moment of peace he had found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While still drifting between sleep and waking, Isaac felt a gentle tug against his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes fluttered open, and the first thing he saw was Verena&#39;s gentle smile gazing back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, you&#39;re finally awake,&#34; said Isaac, his voice still thick with sleep, but the happiness in his tone was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot upright, hands framing her face, searching her expression for any sign of pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay? Do you feel any pain? Is there anything bothering you?&#34; he asked, his questions coming out in a worried rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words rushed out, tumbling over one another,all of his worries spilling out in a single breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Verena didn&#39;t answer right away,he leaned in closer, resting his forehead against her cheek and breathing deeply, desperate to steady his nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dotted her with gentle kisses. First her forehead,then the spot between her brows, the tip of her nose,and finally,her lips. &#34;I was scared out of my mind last night. I can&#39;t even think about what I would&#39;ve done if I&#39;d lost you,&#34; said Isaac, his voice wavering before it trailed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled her in, holding her so tightly it was like he wanted to erase the distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena felt the tension running through him, so she wrapped her arms around his back and tried to comfort him. &#34;I&#39;m alright, see? I made it through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back a little, she met his gaze. &#34;Isaac, my head was foggy last night, but I remember it clearly now.You carried me all the way here, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bits and pieces of the night before started to come back to her, a look of wonder flickering across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even through the pain and confusion, she remembered Isaac carrying her down the stairs and into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes dropped to his legs. The realization made her voice tremble with happiness. &#34;Isaac, your legs-you&#39;re completely healed. You won&#39;t ever need a wheelchair again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears glittered in her eyes as she cupped his cheeks,brushing her thumbs across his skin and holding him close &#34;Nothing could top this. You have no idea how happy I am for you,&#34; said Verena, her smile lighting up her whole face and making her eyes shine so brightly that Isaac felt all the heaviness in his chest begin to fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked back tears, the edges of his lips lifting in a soft smile as he brought her hand to his cheek,soaking up her warmth as if he could keep it with him forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For you, and for our baby, I can do anything,&#34;said Isaac, his voice deep and full of feeling. &#34;Honestly,none of this would have mattered if you weren&#39;t by my side. I&#39;d do anything for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wrapped his arms around her, lowering his chin so it rested on top of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to the strong, steady beat of his heart,Verena melted into his arms, her own heart swelling with contentment. Still, she couldn&#39;t help but tease him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly grin, she looked up at him and joked, &#34;So, if I asked for your life, would you hand it over just like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The playful question lingered in the quiet room, with only birdsong drifting in from outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac hesitated, caught off guard by her words, but then he grew serious. He drew back a little, his hands holding her shoulders as he stared right into her eyes. &#34;I&#39;d give you everything, but not my life. If I gave that up, I couldn&#39;t stay with you. And the idea of anyone else being here with you instead? I couldn&#39;t handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had only meant to poke fun, but she hadn&#39;t expected him to take her so seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was the rush of emotions, or maybe it was just her hormones, but tears pricked at her eyes the moment she heard his answer. She reached for lsaac,wrapping him in a tight embrace and pressing her face into his chest. &#34;I was only kidding. We&#39;re going to be alright. From here on out, nothing&#39;s pulling us apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gathered her close, holding her tight, and pressed a tender kiss to the top of her head, his quiet nod promising he would never let go.</p>
