                <p>Leaning in a bit, Kaia asked, &#34;So... that means she wasn&#39;t a Pine Hill student, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian paused, clearly thinking it over. &#34;I can&#39;t say for sure. My friend&#39;s got connections everywhere, but the campus is packed with gorgeous women-he couldn&#39;t know all of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned the question back on her. &#34;Why are you so interested in this girl, anyway? Is she that important?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia said quickly, &#34;She is-honestly, it&#39;s crucial. Adrian, you&#39;re plugged in with so many people. Could you help me dig up more about her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He mulled it over before giving a nod. &#34;Alright, here&#39;s what l&#39;Il do. I&#39;Il contact someone from school and see if they can send over our med school&#39;s complete roster from that yea. We&#39;ll check for her name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief filled Kaia&#39;s voice. &#34;That&#39;s really helpful,Adrian. Thank you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at a Shoildon restaurant, two men sat facing each other in a private dining room, deep in business talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One, older with silver streaks at his temples, watched everything with alert, calculating eyes-the look of a seasoned executive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from him, a younger man in a wheelchair hid every thought behind a calm, unreadable face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising from his seat, the older man-Jeffry Turner-offered a hand and an overly polite smile. &#34;Mr. Bennett,Turner Group is honored to join forces with your company. Here&#39;s to a thriving alliance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac waited, his eyes resting on the outstretched hand just long enough for Jeffry&#39;s smile to falter, before finally accepting the shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To a thriving alliance,&#34; Isaac replied evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffry&#39;s smile quickly returned as he straightened. &#34;Well, I&#39;ll get out of your hair now, Mr. Bennett. Wouldn&#39;t want to take up more of your valuable time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right on cue, his assistant hurried over to hold the door as Jeffry left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they were gone, Jacob, who had been standing quietly behind Isaac, couldn&#39;t help but remark,&#34;That Jeffry is slick. He&#39;s always out for his own interests. If he didn&#39;t have that tiny link to your mother,he&#39;d never land a partnership like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac let out a small, knowing laugh, hands folded in his lap. &#34;After forty years in the industry,Jeffry knows the game. He won&#39;t lift a finger unless there&#39;s something in it for him first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob nodded, impressed. &#34;You always stay three steps ahead, Mr. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac moved his wheelchair toward the exit. &#34;Let&#39;s get back to the office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out in the hallway, he suddenly caught sight of a familiar face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Gavin-Verena&#39;s friend who had just returned from overseas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started to call out, maneuvering his wheelchair forward, but at that moment, a young woman emerged from the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin greeted her wvith a bright grin and gently guided her into another room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob inclined his head, quietly pressing, &#34;Mr. Bennett, the elevator is ready for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac looked at his assistant and replied, &#34;Go on ahead, Jacob. Wait for me downstairs-l&#39;ve got something to do first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without questioning further, Jacob nodded. &#34;Of course,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac steered himself down the hall, stopping right outside the room Gavin had entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waited patiently, letting the minutes pass. At last, about thirty minutes later, the door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin, heading out toward the restrooms, froze when he spotted Isaac waiting. Surprise flashed across his face.&#34;Were you waiting for me?&#34; Isaac met his gaze and gave a quiet nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin instantly guessed this wasn&#39;t a chance encounter-and he doubted Isaac was here to invite him to a meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cut straight to the point. &#34;This is about Dr. Willis, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac offered a slight nod, admitting, &#34;You and Verena go way back. I&#39;d like to understand her history.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin narrowed his eyes, his mind quickly turning. He recalled his last talk with Verena at the bar and knew Isaac&#39;s memory was patchy at best. Was this sudden interest in Verena&#39;s past because something had changed between them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of anticipation shot through Gavin. &#34;Alright-let&#39;s find a spot to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they headed down the hall, Gavin sent a text. &#34;Ran into someone. I&#39;ll be a while, wait for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the end of the corridor, he stopped and faced Isaac. &#34;Go ahead-whatever you want to know, just ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac hesitated, fingers tightening against his wheels. He wanted to hear about Verena&#39;s past, to piece together the woman he was falling for, but doubt crept in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it right to probe into her life without telling her? The urge to know more fought against the worry that he might be crossing a line, and the uncertainty made him pause, caught between curiosity and concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thoughts spun through Isaac&#39;s head, emotions tangled in a silent war. In the end, after a long pause, he couldn&#39;t bring himself to do something that might upset her. He let out a quiet breath and said, &#34;Never mind,it&#39;s not important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin&#39;s eyebrows shot up in protest; he was not willing to let it go that easily. &#34;Seriously, Mr. Bennett? You waited outside my room, guided me here to talk, andI even texted my friend to hold off for you. Now you say it&#39;s not important? Are you having a laugh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t elaborate, simply nodded and said, &#34;Sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin huffed but decided to keep the conversation going. Leaning against the wall, he crossed his arms and put on a thoughtful face. &#34;Alright, if you&#39;re not talking, l&#39;ll take a stab at it myself. What could possibly have you so curious about a woman&#39;s past? Let&#39;s see...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing out his words with a mischievous glint, Gavin asked, &#34;This is about her love life, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac met Gavin&#39;s eyes, a cold spark flickering in his own, but said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look on Isaac&#39;s face told Gavin he&#39;d hit the mark, and his joking manner instantly faded. He straightened, saying in a more serious tone, &#34;Okay, you don&#39;t have to say it. You&#39;re curious about Dr. Willis&#39;romantic past.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Gavin hesitated. He remembered Verena&#39;s words about keeping Isaac&#39;s memory loss under wraps for the time being-it might complicate things if he found out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, as far as love went, Verena&#39;s history only included Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,how should he phrase it... Suddenly, an idea struck Gavin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly grin and a bit of theatrical flair, Gavin said, &#34;Dr. Willis once had someone who chased after her with everything he had. This guy was completely devoted-he learned to cook just so he could make her different meals every day. And you know what? She ignored a whole parade of impressive admirers just to be with him. They were everyone&#39;s idea of the perfect couple...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac broke in, voice cool and measured. &#34;Did his last name start with an &#39;I&#39;?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That question threw Gavin for a loop. An &#34;I&#34;? Why ask that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hold on a second!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin remembered seeing a small tattoo just beneath Verena&#39;s collarbone: a single letter, I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a topic of teasing before, and Verena claimed it stood for lsaac-something Gavin and the others had never let her live down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization dawned. Isaac must&#39;ve seen that tattoo and thought it was connected to the man in her past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pieces fit, and Gavin barely managed to hide his amusement. This could get interesting.</p>
