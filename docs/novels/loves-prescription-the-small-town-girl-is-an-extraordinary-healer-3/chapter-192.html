                <p>Kaia shook her head, banishing at once the cruel thought that had creptinto her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No-she could never bring herself to do such a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, she despised Verena. But her hatred had always rested on the belief that Verena and Evelyn were two different people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now the truth stood unshakable: Evelyn was Verena,and no power on earth could undo it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Kaia, Evelyn had always held a special meaning,and that bond was something she could never bring herself to destroy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From childhood, Kaia had known deep down she wasn&#39;t truly her parents&#39; beloved child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their kindness toward her had come not from affection, but because the family fortune had blossomed around the time she was born.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood from early on that the love she received was conditional, fleeting as morning dew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Luka&#39;s story was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment he took his first breath, every family asset seemed destined to fall into his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter his choices-wise or foolish-their parents adored him without question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heir to Willis Group was always Luka, and that truth could never be rewritten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia,however, lived a different tale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered one childhood test she had failed;her parents&#39; eyes brimmed with disappointment,as though she were a burden they might cast aside at any time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she excelled in exams, making the family shine before outsiders, suddenly she became their good-luck charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&lt;</p>
