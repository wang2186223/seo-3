                <p>Verena studied Cayden for a moment, curiosity flickering in her eyes. After a brief pause, she confirmed her answer. &#34;No, we&#39;ve never met.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cayden&#39;s brow tightened with a faint crease. The sound of her voice stirred something in him, but he struggled to recall where he had heard it before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she denied the connection, he didn&#39;t press further. Instead, he gave a short nod and stepped forward to help Isaac back into his wheelchair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem fine enough,&#34; Cayden remarked. &#34;But I just received an urgent call from the hospital, so I&#39;ll need to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac nodded and said, &#34;Go on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cayden walked out, silence settled over the room, leaving only Isaac and Verena behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quiet broke when Isaac&#39;s phone buzzed loudly on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at the screen, he picked it up. &#34;Mom? What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Danica&#39;s voice came firm and clear. &#34;I have news for you. The wedding with Verena has been scheduled for next month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s expression tightened, his dislike for her domineering tone written plainly on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not giving him a chance toreply, Danica pressed forward. &#34;You should remind yourself of the bigger picture.I&#39;m well aware you don&#39;t care for Verena, but the Bennett family cannot afford your resistance. Remember your position-you&#39;re a Bennett.That means sacrifices. Even if it feels unfair, you&#39;ll endure it for the family&#39;s sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words slammed shut any room for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac swallowed hard, answering in a low voice, &#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was not the kind of man who accepted destiny without a fight, nor did he ever follow his mother&#39;s commands without thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His marriage with Verena was nothing more than a name on paper, and before he met her, he had every intention of rejecting the Willis family&#39;s daughter. However, once he finally laid eyes on her, he felt an instinctive urge not to resist. What drew him in was not her appearance, but a feeling he found impossible to define.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight turn of his head, Isaac quietly observed Verena as she gathered the medical kit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she noticed his eyes on her, Verena&#39;s lips curved into a calm smile. &#34;I heard your mother just now. She thinks you don&#39;t care for me, but insists you should keep the family&#39;s interests above your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising the kit into her arms, she gave him an easy smile. &#34;Do you feel marrying me is unfair to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand landed lightly on his shoulder. &#34;Relax. You don&#39;t have to like me, and I won&#39;t force anything on you.If you truly feel trapped by this arrangement, I&#39;ll be the one to end it when the moment arrives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ease in her tone made it seem as though the matter didn&#39;t bother her in the least, which was only natural given how little they knew each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Isaac&#39;s chest tightened unexpectedly, as if her words had struck somewhere tender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I..&#34; He tried to speak, but his throat closed around the words, leaving only silence behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac thought about telling her that he didn&#39;t feel any dislike toward her. Yet saying that aloud would suggest there was some affection between them, and that was unthinkable considering how little time they had spent together. What mattered more was the reality that he was in no state to give his heart to anyone.A man bound by crippled legs and plagued by other failings-how could he possibly have anything to give in love? Romantic feelings were never meant for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena picked up on the sudden gloom in his expression, and it brought back a memory-how he used to follow her around with unwavering determination. She&#39;d get fed up sometimes and tell him to leave her alone for good. What was it he used to say in return? Ah, yes. &#34;In this life, it&#39;s only you. Once we&#39;re married,you&#39;ll see me every day. There won&#39;t be any staying away.&#34;That bold promise lingered for a moment in her thoughts before fading away like a passing dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him sit with his head lowered, she found his quiet despair almost too heavy to endure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking closer, she bent over and ran her fingers playfully through his hair. &#34;I&#39;m only teasing. I&#39;m not upset.Besides, feelings can grow, can&#39;t they? We&#39;ve got time to understand each other and see where things lead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head tilted slightly, her smile gentle, as if she were comforting a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s lashes trembled while his gaze lingered blankly on the woman in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The purity in her eyes and the softness of her smile stirred a faint familiarity, though he couldn&#39;t place when or where he&#39;d seen something like it before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat from her palm grazed his hair, leaving a tingling trail that rippled through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lump rose in his throat, and he wonderedif he imagined it. Her touch felt effortless, almost too familiar,as if closeness came naturally to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought, however, was pushed aside at once. In his condition, who would willingly draw near? More likely, she only valued the title that came with being tied to the Bennett family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Part of him wanted to protest-that not every kind of love could be forced to grow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he looked into her eyes, whatever argument he had formed slipped away before he could speak.His hand curled slightly against his leg, and with his eyes lowered, he gave a slow, instinctive nod. &#34;I get it.You&#39;re not wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing his reply, Verena straightened up and spoke with calm sincerity. &#34;Let&#39;s stop here for today. If anything feels off after you get home, please promise me you&#39;ll let me know immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The concern in her voice left him pressing his lips together before he answered in a low tone, &#34;Alright. I will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lingered on his unruly hair. His unexpected compliance drew a small smile from her. &#34;Good boy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand brushed through his hair once more, a playful gesture like a reward, before she gathered her kit and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone in his chair, Isaac&#39;s eyes drifted to the empty doorway. His hair stuck up awkwardly in the middle,leaving him looking a little ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the Willis Villa, Alec and Laura lounged on the sofa with the financial news playing, while Kaia busied herself at the counter preparing coffee for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had just turned toward the stairs when Laura called out to her, &#34;You&#39;re back already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With only a brief look in Laura&#39;s direction, Verena kept her tone flat. &#34;I&#39;m heading upstairs to rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena turned to walk away, Laura chimed in, &#34;The wedding date with the Bennett family has been settled. You and Isaac need to choose a day soon to have your pre-wedding photos taken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m aware,&#34; Verena replied curtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reminder wasn&#39;t necessary; Verena would not have forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s unease grew at Verena&#39;s constant detachment. What if this stubborn girl stirred up problems that jeopardized the Willis projects the Bennetts had backed after the marriage?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding back the unease twisting in her chest, Laura softened her voice and said, &#34;Verena, are you still upset with me? I only said those things because I didn&#39;t want to see you misled. That&#39;s the reason I spoke so harshly. You have to believe that everything I do comes from a place of care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did feel a flicker of guilt for the accusation she&#39;d thrown at Verena that morning, but compared to what was at stake, that guilt barely registered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, however, couldn&#39;t stop the quiet scorn rising in her mind. Laura had shown no hesitation when it came to pointing fingers. And now that sherealized she was in the wrong, she conveniently wrapped her actions in the excuse of concern. Hiding behind the words&#34;everything I do comes from a place of care&#34;didn&#39;t make her accusation any less calculated.</p>
