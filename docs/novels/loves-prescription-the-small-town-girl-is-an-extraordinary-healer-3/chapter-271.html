                <p>After a long silence, Luis finally spoke, his voice softened to a tone as gentle as spring rain. &#34;Since you&#39;ve put it that way, what choice do I have? I can only agree with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hoped that by showing this kind of yielding,his sister might at least feel the weight of his concern,even if it only took the edge off the coldair hanging between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena caught the deliberate softness at once, and her brows drew together. The more she listened, the stranger she found his behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recalling Luis&#39; earlier outrageous remarks about pursuing her, a wave of irritation rose like a storm inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cut him off, her words sharp as a blade. &#34;Mr.Sampson, please speak properly. Don&#39;t parade this false gentleness before a married woman; that trick is far too worn out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone carried an unmistakable disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis froze, visibly startled, and then color rushed to his cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than shame, it was awkwardness that burned through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Running a hand roughly through his hair, he scolded himself inwardly-why had he ever let such foolish words slip past his lips?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, his thoughts circled more around Simon&#39;s matter. Once it was settled, he would find the right time to confess the truth to Verena, hoping they could return to the simple bond of siblings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis sighed, stumbling over his words. &#34;You-you&#39;ve misunderstood. I wasn&#39;t parading anything. I just...ah, never mind. I&#39;ll stop bothering you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the words left his mouth, he felt the more he explained, the more guilty he sounded. Unsure how to go on, he hardened his heart, cut the call short, and spared himself further humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stared at the ended call, her brows still tightly knitted. Luis&#39; behavior struck her as more and more unusual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t fathom why he so often hesitated,why he sometimes behaved as though he were flirting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She truly had no idea what his intentions were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As evening settled, the sky turned a brilliant orange-red, streaked with clouds that filtered the light like sheer veils, casting a gentle glow across the earth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stream of patients at the hospital thinned out,and before clocking out, Verena busied herself putting the medical records in order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she finished, her phone chimed with a crisp notification.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting aside the files, she picked up the phone and saw the familiar note-husband. A smile touched her lips as she opened the message. &#34;Verena, I&#39;m waiting for you downstairs at the hospital. Let&#39;s go home together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reading the brief words, Verena&#39;s delicate brows lifted slightly. She quickly typed back a simple &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising, she went to the changing room, slipped off her white coat, folded it with care, and placed it in the locker. Then she closed the door, picked up her small bag, and left the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, Isaac&#39;s car waited quietly at the roadside, its body catching the fading glow of the setting sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver stepped forward, opening the door for her.Verena gave a polite thanks and got in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she settled, she noticed a U-shaped pillow placed on the seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Isaac, puzzled. &#34;What&#39;s this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t answer right away. Instead, he leaned slightly, adjusting the pillow&#39;s position with his hand. &#34;As the months advance, back pain is common for pregnant women. The doctor mentioned a pillow behind the back helps ease the strain. So, I prepared one for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena felt warmth bloom in hér chest, sweet and soft as honey on the tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back against the pillow, she immediately felt her back relax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to lsaac, her eyes curving with a smile.&#34;Isaac, you&#39;re so good to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she tilted toward him and pressed a gentle kiss on his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they returned home, Rhonda had already set the table, each dish neatly arranged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the couple came in, she greeted them kindly, &#34;Mr. and Mrs. Bennett, you&#39;re back. Dinner is ready-you may eat now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena offered a faint smile and a nod. &#34;Thank you,Rhonda.&#34; Leading Isaac to the sink, she washed her hands with him, and together they sat across from one another at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the pregnancy, Verena&#39;s appetite had waned.Foods she once relished now made her stomach turn at the very thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anything greasy or meaty became unbearable, their smell alone enough to drive her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing this, Isaac had asked Rhonda to prepare meals that were light yet full of nourishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda took the instruction to heart, making sure every dish was both healthy and mild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Verena&#39;s appetite was poor, she forced herself to finish half a bowl for the sake of her health.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the dishes tonight was noodles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She managed a few bites, but soon her brow knitted and nausea surged. Her face turned pale as she retched painfully. The moment her stomach churned, Verena pushed back her chair with a scrape and hurried to the bathroom, hand over her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s heart twisted tight. Without a second thought,he followed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Verena gripped the sink, her body wracked by retching, the slender line of her neck flushed crimson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes were full of worry. &#34;Verena, let&#39;s go to the hospital,&#34; he urged, his hand gently rubbing her back in comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rinsed her mouth with water, and then waved weakly, her hand pressed to her stomach. &#34;I&#39;m fine.Just a little discomfort. I&#39;Il be better after some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Isaac felt helpless, a sense of defeat heavy on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows drew together as his gaze dropped to her slightly rounded belly. With a sigh, he murmured with a mix of reluctance and tenderness, &#34;This little one really knows how to stir up trouble. I almost feel...less fond of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was low and soft. Taking a tissue, he carefully wiped the water from her face, his touch delicate, as if she were the most fragile treasure in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, dinner was forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lay on the bed, though hot the least bit sleepy. Her eyes fixed blankly on the ceiling thoughts wandering endlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, she propped herself against the headboard, picked up a magazine from the bedside table, and flipped through it, trying to distract her restless mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the door opened gently from outside.</p>
