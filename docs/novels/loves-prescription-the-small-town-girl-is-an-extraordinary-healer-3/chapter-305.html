                <p>The reporters moved quickly, adjusting their lenses with precision, ensuring not a single important frame slipped past them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The relentless click of shutters filled the room,sharp and rhythmic, like the pounding of drums. None of them dared miss a shot that might explode into headlines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every frame they captured streamed instantly across the internet, reaching countless viewers in real time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, far across the city, in a shadowed villa,a middle-aged man reclined lazily in an antique chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unsteady glow of the dim light threw strange,shifting shadows over his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the polished table before him sat a porcelain cup,steam curling upward in delicate threads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mist softened his features, but nothing could disguise the sinister glint in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised the cup, blew lightly across the rim, and took a slow sip. As the taste spread over his tongue, his lips curved into a knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The announcement from Luis echoed through the television, catching him off guard for only a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,a cruel sneer twisted across his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So they&#39;ve brought her back? Perfect...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words rolled from him in a low murmur, dark and cold,like a whisper from the abyss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One move with that girl was enough to cripple Joseph and Marisa before. This time, Luis, it&#39;s your turn.&#34;His gaze fixed on Luis&#39; image on the screen, teeth grinding as he hissed. &#34;Enjoy the happiness while it lasts... Soon, you&#39;ll bleed for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Seraphina Villas in Shoildon, Verena and Isaac sat together on the sofa, the glow of the television washing over their faces as the press conference played on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the broadcast neared its close, Verena shifted her gaze toward the man at her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac sat upright, his expression stern, the weight of his thoughts plain to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing her eyes, he turned his head, meeting her  steady look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their gazes held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena finally spoke, biting her lip before saying,&#34;Isaac, my brother and I talked it over. We&#39;ve decided to arrange a party ten days from now. WVill you come with me to Ochrerayd?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand slipped into his, her eyes steady with determination. &#34;This party isn&#39;t just about announcing my return. The real purpose is to lure out the one who took me all those years ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s brows drew together, a sharp seriousness flickering in his eyes. His voice carried the weight of concern. &#34;Verena, this plan is dangerous. Anyone capable of taking you from the Sampson family in secret is not someone ordinary...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Verena pressed her fingers gently against his lips, cutting him off. &#34;I understand the risks. But everything will be prepared. He won&#39;t get the chance to harm me. Besides, with you by my side,how could I possibly be hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When their eyes met, lsaac caught the raw,unwavering trust shining in her clear gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow,that quiet trust eased the weight of worry pressing on his heart.He tightened his grip around her slender hand, his tone resolute. &#34;You&#39;re right. I&#39;ll stay by your side. No matter what, I won&#39;t let anything happen to you. If it comes to it, I&#39;d give everything for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of emotion washed over Verena, but a sudden thought pulled her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows drew together, a distant look settling in as though her mind had wandered elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet spark lit up her eyes, and she turned her head toward Isaac. Her tone softened with a teasing edge.&#34;I don&#39;t want you throwing yourself into danger. The thought of you getting hurt scares me. But... would you promise me one thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice softened into persuasion, sweet enough to melt the weight in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze softened, his deep eyes catching her smile. &#34;Tell me,&#34; he said warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a bright smile, Verena leaned closer, and then rose from the sofa and stepped back a few paces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stand up and come to me,&#34; she said. The request froze lsaac in place, a flicker of panic flashing across his face. His eyes dropped instinctively to his legs, his lips pressing into a thin line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in a deep breath,he tried to steady the storm of emotions inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, his voice came out strained, carrying both helplessness and bitterness.&#34;I... can&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s gaze softened, her tone gentle yet firm.&#34;Isaac, I&#39;ve seen the footage in the study. You&#39;ve stood before, more than once. I know you can do it.Just try with me now. You can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s brows knitted tightly as he pressed his palms hard against his knees, his head bowing low. His fringe slipped forward, shadowing his eyes so no one could read what lay behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, those rare moments he had risen in the study hadn&#39;t been conscious choices. They were born out of instinct, his fear for Verena driving him to act when logic and limitation should have stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, asked to stand on his own, his will faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t the fear of failing that chained him to the seat-it was the thought of seeing the disappointment in Verena&#39;s eyes. Watching his hesitation, Verena felt her chest tighten.  Resigned, she tried coaxing him with a gentler touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone turned playful. &#34;Isaac, please, jst try.I know you can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, his head lifted slowly, eyes clouded with conflict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could speak, Verena crooked her finger in a teasing gesture, her voice lilting with sweet mischief.&#34;Come on, walk over here to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,his body betrayed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying a word, he stared at her, his jaw clenched and fingers tightening around his knees before he even noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed right where he was, making no move to rise from his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena narrowed her eyes in mock anger,stamping her foot and planting her hands on her hips. &#34;Isaac,I mean it. If you won&#39;t listen to me, I might really stop paying attention to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chose her words with sharp edges, hoping the sting would push Isaac to find his strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he heard her words, a flicker of unease rushed through Isaac. His head snapped up, panic flooding his eyes as he rushed out the words. &#34;Verena, please, don&#39;t be upset.I didn&#39;t mean it. I swear I didn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet even as the words rushed out, his body stayed rooted to the sofa,unmoving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena could see that this path would lead nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flicked with a sudden idea. She placed a gentle hand on her rounded belly, letting her features crease as if in pain. Her voice came out weak and strained.&#34;Oh,sweetheart... with the baby, I can&#39;t stay standing much longer. My legs already ache so badly.If you don&#39;t come help me, I really don&#39;t think I can hold on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swayed lightly as she spoke, her act so believable it tugged at the heart as if it were true.</p>
