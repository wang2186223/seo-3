                <p>At those heartfelt words, Verena turned toward Sherwood and bent slightly in gratitude. &#34;Mr. Kirk,thank you. Luis and I will never forget how much kindness you&#39;ve &#39;shown us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could lower herself fully, Sherwood moved quickly and lifted her back up with gentle hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Affection softened his expression, and his gaze lingered on her as though he were looking at a daughter long lost. HHis whole demeanor radiated pride and care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed her hand reassuringly and spoke with warmth. &#34;There&#39;s no need for thanks, my dear. We&#39;re bound like family, and family should always help each other.What truly matters is that you&#39;ve come back safe and sound.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting his attention to Luis, his eyes grew serious.&#34;Luis,your sister has returned, and it falls on you to look after her well. She has likely gone through many hardships while she was away, and now that she is home at last, she ought to have some peace. If there comes a time when you face trouble or find yourself  needing assistance, do not hesitate to speak up. I will gladly lend you my help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis gave a firm nod. &#34;I understand. Thank you for your concern. I&#39;ll protect Verena and won&#39;t allow anyone to hurt her again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A proud smile spread across Sherwood&#39;s face as he patted Luis on the shoulder. &#34;That&#39;s exactly what I hoped to hear. You&#39;ve always been dependable. I trust you&#39;ll do right by your sister. She&#39;s grown into such a graceful and inteligent young woman. Our two families should meet more often. It&#39;s always better to have lively company around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From theside, Molly quietly observed the exchange.She noticed how deeply Luis treasured his sister.Though a flicker of emotion stirred in her chest, she kept it hidden behind composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,she stepped forward with a radiant smile and slipped her hand into Verena&#39;s with ease. &#34;Yes, Verena,you&#39;re truly delightful. I felt an instant connection the moment I saw you. Let&#39;s spend time together from now on. I&#39;ve been wanting a good companion, and I think I&#39;ve found one in you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, uncomfortable with too much warmth from someone she barely knew, kept her tone gracious.&#34;Thank you, Miss Kirk. I&#39;ll be sure to ask you for tips on where to go in Ochrerayd.&#34; Molly gave a playful wave of her hand, her smile wide.&#34;Don&#39;t call me Miss Kirk. That sounds stiff. Just say Molly.We&#39;re practically friends now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small, composed smile curved Verena&#39;s lips as she carefully eased her hand free, though she gave a polite nod in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly,brimming.with energy, clearly wasn&#39;t ready to let the moment end and leaned in as if eager to keep the exchange going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis cut in smoothly, his timing precise. &#34;Mr. Kirk, the wind is stronger out here. It&#39;s warmer inside. Please go ahead and rest in the hall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifted slightly to the side, motioning toward the entrance of the main hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s eyes flicked toward Verena, lingering briefly on the faint curve of her belly before he answered warmly, &#34;You&#39;re right, Luis. Molly and I will go in first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an easy smile, he led the way toward the main hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Molly seemed reluctant to pull back, she didn&#39;t challenge her father&#39;s lead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,she flashed Verena another bright smile. &#34;I&#39;ll  go in first then. We can pick up where we left off inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, she trailed after Sherwood into the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s gaze lingered on Molly&#39;s graceful figure for a moment, curiosity stirring before she turned back to Luis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a short pause, she asked quietly,&#34;Luis...you and Molly, is there something between you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint crease formed on Luis&#39; brow as he lowered his voice. &#34;Sherwood has entertained the idea of tying our families closer through marriage. With our history and business ties, the elders think it would make sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words slowed, edged with resolve. &#34;But I&#39;ve never felt anything for her in that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded in quiet understanding. &#34;Love can&#39;t be manufactured. You should follow your heart, not obligations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis gave a weary shake of his head. &#34;Still, Sherwood has always treated me with generosity. That makes it hard. Whenever he drops hints, I usually steer the conversation elsewhere, just to	avoid	an uncomfortable scene.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave Luis&#39; shoulder a firm but gentle pat. &#34;Luis, don&#39;t let it weigh too heavily on you. Sherwood has always shown you kindness, and I believe he&#39;s a reasonable man. When you find the right moment,speak honestly with him. Marriage isn&#39;t something to rush-it deserves patience and thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis inclined his head, ready to answer, but his words stalled when his eyes caught a figure drawing near.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac moved forward in his wheelchair, a white shawl draped carelessly over his arm, his composure calm as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trailing a few steps behind him was a striking young woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flowing gown of deep blue clung to her form,cinching at the waist before cascading into a skirt that swayed with each graceful step,like petals stirred by a soft breeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heels struck the floor in a delicate rhythm, each click ringing clear in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Luis&#39; focus shift, Verena instinctively followed his line of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved with recognition as Isaac came closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze drifted past him, landing on the woman at his back. A spark of surprise lit her eyes before it melted into joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miranda?&#34; She moved forward quickly,her voice warm.&#34;What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s eyes flicked briefly to Luis before settling on Verena. Her smile carried both charm and ease. &#34;I&#39;m attending on behalf of my company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Playfully pretending to be offended, Miranda tapped Verena&#39;s arm. &#34;If I hadn&#39;t seen Isaac at the gates,I&#39;d never have discovered your true origins. How could you keep something like this from me? Aren&#39;t we supposed to be best friends?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s expression softened with guilt. &#34;I wasn&#39;t trying to hide it. Everything happened so suddenly,and I&#39;ve barely had time to breathe, let alone explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As their voices mingled, Isaac wheeled closer,slipping the shawl over Verena&#39;s shoulders in quiet care.</p>
