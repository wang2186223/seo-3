                <p>The following morning,at the Sampson Villa...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bathroom glowed softly, the light spreading a warm,gentle haze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sink, Isaac carefully squeezed toothpaste onto Verena&#39;s brush before tending to his own. Both were preparing to brush their teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him, Verena was in front of the mirror, casually fixing her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her eyes drifted upward, they landed on her own neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, several hickeys stood vividly against her delicate skin-like scarlet stamps of last night&#39;s passion, impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As though drawn by some silent thread, her gaze met Isaac&#39;s in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena shot him a playful glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac immediately set down his toothbrush, his voice laced with apology yet softened by affection. &#34;Sorry,  I lost control last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice, low and magnetic, carried a subtle current that lingered in Verena&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, leaned close, and brushed a gentle kiss against the corner of his lips. &#34;Alright, you&#39;re forgiven.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After completing their morning routine, Verena reached for concealer and carefully covered the hickeys on her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, Joseph and Marisa were seated on the sofa,while Luis lingered on the balcony, speaking on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Verena and Isaac came down, Joseph immediately instructed a servant to bring out breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The family gathered around the table. They ate together, though Luis finished quickly and left for the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under Joseph&#39;s and Marisa&#39;s watchful eyes, Verena managed a glass of milk and a sandwich.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing she couldn&#39;t eat more, they held back from pressing her further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once breakfast ended, she and lsaac lingered for a while,chatting with her parents before preparing to  leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marisa, however, looked reluctant. She clung to Verena&#39;s hand, urging her again and again not to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena patiently comforted her, promising she would visit again in just a few days. At last, Marisa relented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they stepped outside, Verena&#39;s phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caller was Sherwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered and greeted politely, &#34;Hello, Mr. Kirk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the other end came a gentle male voice.&#34;Verena, I hope I&#39;m not intruding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he couldn&#39;t see her, Verena pressed her lips together and kept a polite smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not, Mr.Kirk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; Sherwood said. He continued after a pause,as if weighing his words, &#34;Verena, I once told you about my health troubles. This illness cannot be put off any longer. I wanted to ask for your help, but l worried I might consume too much of your time.Would now be convenient?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Isaac&#39;s eyes narrowed, a flicker of sternness darkening his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her wariness,Verena remembered her promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, she wasn&#39;t certain if their suspicions were correct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she answered firmly, &#34;Mr. Kirk, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll do everything I can to help you recover. Send me the address-I&#39;ll come right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, Isaac spoke without hesitation,his tone firm as stone. &#34;I&#39;ll go with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes left no room for refusal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Verena smiled gently and shook her head. Her voice softened.&#34;No need.You have matters to handle -go on and take care of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his hesitation, she reassured him. &#34;Don&#39;t worry.Even if he harbors schemes, he won&#39;t dare act openly.I&#39;m going there at his request to treat him. He wouldn&#39;t be so reckless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac frowned, his concern still etched deeply. &#34;Are you certain you don&#39;t want me along? Sherwood is cunning.I worry for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena leaned down, brushed a kiss across his cheek,and looked steadily into his eyes. &#34;I&#39;ll be fine. Don&#39;t you trust my ability? Besides, Luis is still here. Once l finish, I&#39;ll update you at once, alright?&#34; Isaac sighed in resignation, tapping her nose lightly with a fingertip. &#34;Be very careful. The moment anything feels wrong, call me. I&#39;ll be there in a heartbeat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded. &#34;Alright, don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So they parted-lsaac back to Shoildon, Verena into the car bound for the Kirk family residence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, her car eased onto the road leading to the Kirk family villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a black veicle approached head-on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they passed each other, Verena,idly watching the scenery outside, caught sight of a middle-aged man seated in the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore a gray suit and square-framed glasses, their lenses glinting faintly in the sunlight, adding a touch of mystery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brown birthmark marked his right cheek, prominent and unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly. The face tugged at her memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of familiarity washed over her, and she frowned,searching her mind. Then, in a sudden flash, she recalled-she had seen him at last night&#39;s party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t he a senior executive from Sampson Group?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes sharpened at once,puzzlement stirring within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This road led straight to the Kirk family villa. Why was he here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her car neared the villa gates, she forced herself to set aside the thought for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car stopped at the entrance. Sherwood greeted her warmly, his face spread in welcoming smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena,you came so quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She returned his warmth with composure, smiling gently. &#34;Mr. Kirk, since you&#39;re unwell, I wouldn&#39;t dare delay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she followed him into the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac didn&#39;t come with you?&#34; Sherwood asked casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena remained poised. Her lips curved slightly as she shook her head. &#34;He returned to Shoildon for business.&#34; &#34;I see.&#34; He nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the living room, he gestured for her to sit,and then personally poured her a cup of coffee, his manner all attentiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try this, Verena. I prepared it especially for you,&#34; he said, offering the cup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She accepted politely, thanked him, took a light sip,and then placed it down again, cutting straight to the matter.&#34;Mr. Kirk, let&#39;s talk about your health.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, Sherwood nodded. &#34;Very well. Please follow me to the private medical facility in the back garden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wealth often brought its own form of caution-many powerful families built clinics within their homes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s, however, was not only complete but luxurious, with advanced equipment and shelves stocked with medicine, a testament to how much he prized his health.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena began by reviewing his past medical records before conducting a thorough examination herself.</p>

By the time liver cancer was discovered,many patients were already beyond the first stage.</p>
