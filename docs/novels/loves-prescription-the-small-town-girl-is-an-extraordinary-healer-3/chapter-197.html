                <p>Katelyn was wearing a mask of remorse before lsaac when her phone suddenly chimed with a message notification.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved in a smile, and then she pretended to clutch her stomach, her brows drawn tight in mock discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac understood perfectly why she was playing this charade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chose to act along, his expression turning deliberately cold and impatient as he asked, &#34;What&#39;s troubling you this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was as steady as ever, giving Katelyn no reason to doubt him. She pressed her brows together again, her voice tinged with false apology.&#34;Forgive me, Isaac. My stomach isn&#39;t well-I need to step away to the restroom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gave a small nod, granting permission without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn picked up her phone and hurried away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside the restroom, she unlocked the screen in haste. The moment she saw the message from Elmore Finch, the hitman she had hired, a sinister thrill flickered across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Verena was within her grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dialed Elmore&#39;s number without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call was answered almost immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her voice, Katelyn asked, &#34;Are you certain she&#39;s been captured?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elmore&#39;s voice came steady. &#34;Rest assured, Miss Fuller. She&#39;s unconscious, tied securely, and we&#39;re waiting on you to handle the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn had given strict orders: no one was to touch Verena until she arrived. Elmore and his men were merely tasked with the capture, not the kill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Katelyn longed to witness with her own eyes-Verena kneeling, begging for her life, confessing her faults.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Isaac remained a danger she had to keep tightly in check. He could never be allowed to notice Verena&#39;s disappearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this thought burning in her mind, she made another call-to the other hitman she had hired at a steep price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No pleasantries, no wasted words. She went straight to the point the moment the line connected. &#34;Have you secured Isaac&#39;s assistant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A raspy voice answered with grim confidence,&#34;You needn&#39;t worry. When I strike, failures do not exist. A timed bomb has already been set in the car. Once Isaac gets in, he&#39;ll have no escape.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This hitman was bought with heavy coin, and Katelyn placed full faith in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she would not allow Isaac an easy death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once he&#39;s in the car, stall him. Don&#39;t let him perish too swiftly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she couldn&#39;t possess him, she would see him ruined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Isaac had not only denied her love but had shamed her without mercy. She would make him pay the full price of scorning her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before death claimed him, she wanted him to watch Verena suffer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having tied every loose thread, Katelyn left the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile polished once more, she returned to Isaac.&#34;I&#39;m sorry to have kept you waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes were cold as winter stone. &#34;If there&#39;s nothing further, I&#39;ll be leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing the hitman had already taken lsaac&#39;s car and subdued his assistant, Katelyn&#39;s heart eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, the rest was but a matter of time-once Isaac entered that car, the trap would spring shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well. Thank you for meeting me today,&#34; Katelyn said, forcing a bitter smile. &#34;Goodbye, Isaac. Once I walk away, perhaps I&#39;ll never return. For everything I&#39;ve done, I hope you and Verena might find it in your hearts to forgive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gave no reply, only turned his wheelchair and rolled out of the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s eyes followed his retreating back as she trailed behind at a measured pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched Jacob lift him carefully into the car,noticed Jacob&#39;s hesitant hands and the sweat standing on his brow, and then her gaze caught on the driver-masked, hidden behind sunglasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man cast her a fleeting glance; their eyes met,and a slight nod passed between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Katelyn feel assured enough to step into her own car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, Isaac was already a trapped bird with broken wings, struggling without hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But inside the car, Isaac leaned against the seat with quiet composure and asked the driver in a low voice,&#34;Is my wife safe?&#34;</p>
