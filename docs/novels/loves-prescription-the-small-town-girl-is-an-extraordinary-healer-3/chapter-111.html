                <p>&#34;There you are, I was about to call you,&#34; said Verena as she turned to Miranda. &#34;This man insists he&#39;s from Pine Hill University, yet strangely, he acts as though he doesn&#39;t even understand how vast the campus is.He claims not knowing me is proof I never graduated from there. And before I had the chance to respond,another woman jumped in, saying | was her classmate at some community college. Can you step in and confirm that I truly graduated from Pine Hill University?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With wide eyes, Adrian fixed his gaze on Miranda.&#34;Miranda?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought that Miranda could really be Verena&#39;s friend was something he struggled to accept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Miranda appeared, the distinguished guests grew restless. The younger heirs were too inexperienced with family businesses to recognize her. The older executives had dealt with overseas corporations for years, so they knew who she was right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of astonishment rippled through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s Ms. Brown!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hasn&#39;t she settled overseas? What&#39;s she doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on, is Verena&#39;s friend actually Ms. Brown?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could Ms. Brown really have come all this way just to attend Verena&#39;s wedding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is this Ms. Brown anyway?&#34; one of the newly rich businessmen asked in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious? You don&#39;t know who she is?&#34;someone nearby responded. &#34;Surely you&#39;ve heard of AuroraNexus,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, everyone knows it&#39;s the sixth largest conglomerate in the world.&#34; &#34;Her full name is Miranda Brown. She graduated with honors from Pine Hlill University and today she&#39;s the CEO of AuroraNexus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? She&#39;s that young?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone else shook his head with a sigh of respect.&#34;Her age doesn&#39;t mean a thing. Her ability is far beyond anything we could ever compete with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By listening carefully to Verena, Miranda caught on that Adrian and the woman were intentionally stirring up trouble for Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda laid a protective hand gently on Verena&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, the claim is that Verena didn&#39;t graduate from Pine Hill University, isn&#39;t it?&#34; she asked, throwing a glance toward Adrian. &#34;Showing off about schools may not be admirable, but certain truths must be made clear. Otherwise, there will always be people ready to misjudge and belittle my closest friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda fixed Adrian with a cold look full of disdain. &#34;Listen closely. Verena is a true graduate of Pine HHill University. She&#39;s not only my fellow alumna but also my dearest friend. If you dare to look down on her,you insult me as well. If you stand against her, then you stand against me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she finished, the crowd erupted into a stir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The intent of Miranda&#39;s words was unmistakable.She was openly pledging her support for Verena, and by tying their friendship to Pine Hill University, she hinted that Verena could never have been a mere community college graduate. Without that shared background, Verena would never have even crossed paths with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could Verena actually be a graduate of Pine Hill University?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Ms. Browvn herself says so, then it has to be true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then how do we explain those two who came forward before?&#34; &#34;I think this must have been part of a setup!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Miranda&#39;s declaration sank in, the elite guests broke into murmurs among themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who didn&#39;t know the truth of the matter were quickly influenced by the opinions and gestures around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater and Bobby had never doubted Verena, so the question of her degree barely crossed their minds.What they were truly trying to take in was the shocking revelation about Miranda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater blinked hard, snapping his mouth shut before blurting out, &#34;Unbelievable, the stunning bridesmaid we were talking to is really the CEO of AuroraNexus!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby looked just as bewildered. &#34;Who could have guessed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura gripped the hem of her dress with force, a wave of relief washing over her at the news that Verena was cleared. Thankfully, that troublesome girl wouldn&#39;t be pulling them down. Yet as Miranda&#39;s  words lingered, an unspoken regret flickered in her gaze. Verena truly had luck on her side. Had she realized just how capable Verena was, she never would have treated her so poorly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Miranda came into view, Alec pushed himself up sharply from his chair. Hiseyes narrowed,uncertain if he was seeing correctly, but the whispers around him confirmed she really was the CEO of AuroraNexus, twisting his expression into something conflicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re glad to hear your daughter&#39;s name has been cleared, Mr. Willis. You must be relieved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right, Mr. Willis. You absolutely need to uncover who attempted to ruin such an important event.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The businessmen&#39;s demeanor flipped in an instant.Only minutes before, they had kept their distance from him because of Verena, yet now they forced smiles and lifted their glasses as though none of it had ever happened.  Alec didn&#39;t wish to answer, but with a rigid smile, he responded, &#34;Of course, certainly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the words left his mouth, Kaia&#39;s remarks from a few days ago echoed in his head, and a sudden realization struck him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s complexion turned ghostly, her lips fading into a purplish hue as allvitality drained from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From within the crowd, she felt the change in the air and stumbled backward a few steps, her legs trembling so badly she nearly collapsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her retreat continued, yet her gaze clung desperately to Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Kaia asked, her voice so faint she could barely hear it herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing could explain how things had ended up like this. Miranda was meant to be Adrian&#39;s connection,not Verena&#39;s. After all the effort Kaia put in to get Miranda&#39;s contact information, finding out now that Miranda belonged firmly on Verena&#39;s side felt like a  cruel twist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The disappointment was suffocating. Why did Verena find everything so easily, while Kaia was left empty-handed, no matter how hard she tried?</p>
