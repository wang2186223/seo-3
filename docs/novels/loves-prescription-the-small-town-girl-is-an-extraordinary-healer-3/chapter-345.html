                <p>Yet Molly found no appetite at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind kept replaying the scene of Luis and Miranda walking side by side, leaving the hotel together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy and resentment swirled within her like a storm that refused to settle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she dared not breathe a word of it to Sherwood.He had already hinted that she should give up on Luis,and if she told him what she saw, it would only hand him more reason to press his point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly bit her lip, steadied her emotions, and walked to the dining table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drew out a chair, sat down, and stared blankly at the meal before her, her heart barren of hunger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood folded his newspaper aside and began to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly lifted her fork, managed a few perfunctory bites,and then suddenly recalled something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lit with fresh hope. Setting the fork down she leaned forward eagerly. &#34;Dad, didn&#39;t you promise long ago to discuss a marriage arrangement with the Sampson family? How is it progressing? What did Luis &#39;father say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood halted, slowly raising his head to meet her anxious gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of Luis&#39; unyielding rejection struck him,stirring a sudden fury. He pitied Molly&#39;s steadfast devotion to a love that gave her nothing, but even more,he burned with anger at the Sampson family&#39;s ingratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed, a cold glint flashing within them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy snort, he spoke in a voice sharp as steel.&#34;Molly, the Sampsons have no wish for you. But rest assured, I won&#39;t allow you to bear this humiliation for nothing. Since they refuse our goodwill, I shall act against them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly,who had been holding her breath in anticipation of good news, froze at his words. Her face went pale.Sherwood, always gentle and loving-especially to her,his daughter-now revealed a side she had never witnessed, as cold as winter frost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver ran down her spine, and she forced her voice through trembling lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, what do you mean by that?&#34; Sherwood&#39;s smile masked a fierce resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out, patting her head, though his eyes gleamed with chilling determination. &#34;Molly,remember this-here in Ochrerayd, only our Kirk family has the right to stand above all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly looked at him in bewilderment, confusion etched into her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could not grasp why he spoke so suddenly of ambition and power, nor from where this consuming desire for control sprang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart, however, remained fixedonly on Luis. She nodded absentmindedly, her thoughts drifting back to him alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew one thing with certainty: she loved Luis.She yearned for his affection, desperate to be the sole one at his side. Even though his heart held no special place for her, her obsession had never faltered. She longed for him-by whatever terms, by whatever means.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s gaze swept over Molly and settled in the distance, hardening with murderous intent. He understood that before striking at the Sampson family,his health had to be secured. And only Verena possessed the skill to treat him. For that reason alone,he had to keep her close until his illness was cured. The following morning, at the Sampson Villa, sunlight streamed gently through the corridor windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena,having completed her routine, gathered her things and stepped out of her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, she nearly collided with Luis, who was about to leave for his morning jog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was dressed in light athletic wear, his tall frame touched by the golden glow of morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Verena already prepared for work, he arched a brow, curiosity flickering. &#34;Heading to the company this early?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lifted the medical kit in her hand and shook her head. &#34;Sherwood sent me a message last night. He asked me to treat him this morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant Sherwood&#39;s name was spoken, Luis &#39;relaxed look tightened,worry and caution flashing in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After their conversation yesterday, unease over Sherwood&#39;s unpredictable nature had only deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He disliked the thought of Verena going alone,but he knew that telling her to refuse might stir Sherwood&#39;s suspicion and bring greater danger. After a pause, he spoke earnestly. &#34;Do you need me to send someone to protect you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting his serious gaze, Verena&#39;s lips curved into a quiet smile. &#34;I&#39;m the only one who can treat his illness.Until he recovers, he won&#39;t dare harm me-otherwise,he&#39;d be signing his own death warrant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis inclined his head slightly. &#34;Very well. But be cautious.If anything happens,reach out to me at once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded gently, lifted her kit, and began to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After only a few steps, she stopped and turned back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Luis,&#34; she called softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brow lifted in mild curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She studied his puzzled face, and then smiled playfully.&#34;You came back late last night. Mom and Dad were asleep, but I happened to hear you when I stepped out of the bathroom. However busy you get, don&#39;t forget to take care of yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis faltered, recalling in an instant the events of the night before. He had intended to head home after dinner,yet somehow ended up in the car with Miranda</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A trace of awkwardness passed over his face; he  coughed lightly into his fist and gave a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena smiled, turned away, and had only taken two steps when she stopped once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And another thing.&#34; She lifted a finger and pointed teasingly at his shoulder, her eyes sparkling with mischief. &#34;Those scratch marks are rather obvious.Button up your shirt before Mom and Dad see. It wouldn&#39;t look good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; face stiffened with embarrassment as his hand instinctively went to his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His loose collar made the raised welts easy to feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, words deserted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching his discomfort, Verena chuckled inwardly but spared him further teasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She headed downstairs, leaving him behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis remained standing,eyes following her retreating figure, and then shook his head with resigned amusement. He glanced down at his open collar,his hand brushing the marks again. There were more than a few. If he went running now, his parents would surely notice when he came back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering his gaze, he let out a soft laugh. Miranda really was a little devil. Best to skip the jog today. With that decision, he turned back into his room and changed into a suit.</p>
