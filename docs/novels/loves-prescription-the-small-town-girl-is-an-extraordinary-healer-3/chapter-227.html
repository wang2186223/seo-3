                <p>Slater lifted his eyes and found Bobby staring at him,that eerie grin curling his lips, a smile so chilling it sent shivers racing down Slater&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His own lips twitched, wariness creeping across his expression. &#34;Do me a favor-don&#39;t look at me with that sinister smile. It&#39;s downright unsettling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resting his chin on his hand, Bobby&#39;s tone turned teasingly cryptic. &#34;Perhaps I&#39;vefigured out why lsaac picked you to seduce this man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word &#34;seduce&#34; carried a sting, yet curiosity got the better of Slater. Tilting his head, he asked softly,&#34;Why&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby, catching the innocence in his face, smirked with mischief. &#34;Just look at yourself-those wide eyes are more enchanting than most women&#39;s. Your skin&#39;s smooth and luminous, and that neat oval face could fit into one hand. Aren&#39;t these the marks of a perfect romantic lead? Trust me, men will be drawn to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Slater often seemed carefree, at heart he was shy. Bobby&#39;s description painted him in strokes too bold;his cheeks warmed, and panic flickered in his gaze.&#34;What nonsense are you spouting? Keep this up,and I won&#39;t talk to you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby burst out laughing at his flustered response.&#34;Alright, alright. Don&#39;t get worked up. I&#39;ll stop teasing.Let&#39;s shift to lsaac&#39;s task-you&#39;re ready for it, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of business cleared Slater&#39;s embarrassment. He leaned forward eagerly. &#34;You already have a plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby tapped at the phone screen. &#34;Didn&#39;t my brother send you the file? It maps out Simon&#39;s daily schedule, the routes he takes. Isn&#39;t the meaning obvious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater blinked, still uncertain. &#34;Meaning what exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clicking his tongue, Bobby sighed. &#34;An encounter,my friend. We need to stage an accidental meeting. If you want to dress it up,call it fate-serendipity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization struck Slater, and he drew a steady breath.&#34;No time to lose then. Let&#39;s get started.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.··</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By evening, the hospital stood quiet, washed in the  warm glow of sunset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Slater paced at the entrance, glancing repeatedly through the lobby doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crease formed between his brows, puzzlement taking hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s document had clearly stated Simon would be finishing work around this hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun was nearly swallowed by the horizon-so why hadn&#39;t he appeared?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Slater&#39;s patience began to fray,his earpiece crackled. Bobby&#39;s low voice came through. &#34;Slater,he&#39;s on his way out. Time to move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, Slater masked himself in innocence, his gaze drifting casually toward the approaching figure</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes-it was Simon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,Slater stepped towNard him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they drew level, Slater-suppressing his discomfort -feigned a stumble, twisting his foot and letting himself fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a breath, he toppled into Simon&#39;s arms, clutching his broad shoulders for balance. From afar, Bobby&#39;s face carried mixed emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t distaste for two men together-only that it felt strange to witness such closeness firsthand between his best friend and a stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater&#39;s eyes squeezed shut, his body stiff,bracing himself as though the mission demanded a small sacrifice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Simon&#39;s response cut the script short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had Slater fallen against him than Simon pushed him away, faint disgust flickering across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reaction was nothing like Slater had envisioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he didn&#39;t let his shock surface. He stayed in character.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color flushed his cheeks as he ducked his head, eyes brimming with apology. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry-terribly sorry.I stumbled and bumped into you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon gave him a quick glance, a polite smile touching his lips though his eyes stayed cool. &#34;It&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned as if to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise swelled in Slater&#39;s chest. Hadn&#39;t Isaac claimed he was the best option? Hadn&#39;t Bobby said men would  be drawn to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then why this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to admit defeat, Slater caught Simon&#39;s sleeve.Simon turned back, frowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater knitted his brows lightly, teeth grazing his lower lip,his face carrying both pain and fragile appeal. &#34;I...I saw the pen in your pocket. You must be a doctor,right? I think I twisted my ankle-maybe even hurt the bone. It aches badly. Could you take a look?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s face remained composed, his tone steady.&#34;Sorry, I&#39;m a psychologist, not an orthopedic doctor.&#34;His voice was calm, stripped of emotion. &#34;I&#39;ll call a nurse to guide you to the orthopedic department instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out his phone, quickly arranging for a nurse to bring a wheelchair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once done, he pressed his lips together and told Slater,&#34;Wait here. The nurse will be right out. I have other matters-so I&#39;ll be leaving now.&#34;</p>
