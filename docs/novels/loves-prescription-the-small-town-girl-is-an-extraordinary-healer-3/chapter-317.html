                <p>Molly slowed her steps, quietly letting herself drift to the back of the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes clung to Verena up ahead, who was tenderly held between Joseph and Marisa, as though their arms formed a fortress around her. Marisa clutched Verena as if afraid she might vanish like smoke in the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly recalled Marisa&#39;s affectionate gaze at the entrance earlier, and a storm of mixed feelings stirred within her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Sampson family had searched for Verena for more than twenty years, and Molly already knew they treasured their daughter beyond measure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,seeing it with her own eyes, she realized their devotion to Verena ran even deeper than she had ever imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In silence, Molly reflected: Verena&#39;s standing in the Sampson family was immovable, as solid as a mountain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Therefore, if she truly wished to win Luis&#39; heart,she must avoid crossing Verena at all costs. pon hearing the news of the group&#39;s visit, Joseph ad quickly instructed the servants to prepare a velcoming dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the dining table, the dishes were laid out with meticulous care, fragrant steam curling into the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph gazed at Verena with tenderness overflowing,his voice gentle as he said, &#34;Verena, try this grilled fish.It&#39;s a specialty from your mother&#39;s hometown, made with a secret recipe. She personally asked the chef to prepare it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marisa,sitting close by, instantly placed a portion on Verena&#39;s plate, murmuring, &#34;Sweetheart, taste it.Careful now,it&#39;s still hot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes never strayed from Verena, brimming with attachment and reliance, as though every breath revolved around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena looked at the golden, finely shaped fish on her plate, its aroma teasing her senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac quietly removed the bones for her, and Verena dipped the tender meat into the sweet-and-sour sauce before bringing it to her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flavor melted on her tongue-balanced, rich, and gentle-yet her eyes glistened red with tears. Parental love,absent for so long, now lay before her like a jewel finally unearthed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Kaia&#39;s birth when Verena was seven, she had only watched from the shadows as Alec and Laura poured affection onto Kaia and Luka.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen Alec prepare gifts with careful thought for Kaia&#39;s birthdays, his gaze overflowing with indulgence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen Laura spend sleepless nights by Luka&#39;s bedside when illness struck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Verena-she had been nothing more than a bystander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter the envy or longing swelling within her,she had always buried it deep, never daring to let it show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But tonight, for the first time, she felt how fierce and boundless a parent&#39;s love could truly be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wrapped around her, filling her heart with both sweetness and ache, a paradox of joy and sorrow mingled together. Overcome, tears welled and blurred her sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, why are you crying?&#34; Joseph&#39;s voice carried anxious concern, while Marisa quickly clasped her daughter&#39;s hand. Verena brushed her tears away, forcing a fragile smile,er voice thick. &#34;Dad, Mom, I&#39;m fine. The fish is just so delicious... I&#39;ve never tasted anything as divine as this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pulled out a tissue, gently dabbing at her tears,his palm resting softly on her back to steady her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her words, Joseph and Marisa finally breathed easier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph spoke warmly. &#34;Good girl, if you like the fish,eat as much as you wish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena managed a small smile, nodding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s gaze shifted to Isaac, who had silently cared for Verena all evening. His appreciation for the young man grew like a flame fanned by the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smile, he said, &#34;Isaac, I wonder if these dishes suit your taste. If you have any preferences,let me know. I&#39;ll make sure the chef prepares something special for you next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac set down his utensils at once, straightening his posture. With a modest bow and a respectful smile,he replied sincerely, &#34;That&#39;s most thoughtful of you,Joseph. Tonight&#39;s meal has been a true delight, thanks to you and Marisa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes shone with genuine respect as he looked at Joseph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her seat,Verena&#39;s heart swelled with warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped her hand over Isaac&#39;s, smiling as she told her father, &#34;Dad, Isaac isn&#39;t particular. Don&#39;t worry.We both love everything you and Mom prepared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marisa nodded eagerly, her face glowing with kindness.&#34;As long as you enjoy it, I&#39;m content.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smile, Luis said to Marisa, &#34;Mom,you must eat more as well. Tonight should be a true celebration-joyful and hearty-with Verena home again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated quietly, Sherwood observed the harmony at the table. A faint smile played on his lips, though for an instant his kindly eyes revealed a sharp,calculating gleam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was gone in a heartbeat, replaced by warmth. He lifted his wine glass, rising with a voice full ofemotion.&#34;Joseph, Marisa, nothing brings me more joy than seeing your family whole again. All these years you searched high and low, spreading notices, asking anyone who might know. I&#39;ve witnessed the toll it took-the effort, the cost-and my heart ached for you.But God has shown mercy, and the trial has finally ended.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone softened, and then brightened with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Family reunion outweighs all else. And to know Verena has married Mr. Bennett, such a fine man-handsome,capable, and talented-truly, the two of them are a match made in heaven. It is the happiest of endings, and I rejoice with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s eyes brimmed with emotion at Sherwood&#39;s heartfelt words. He raised his glass in haste.&#34;Sherwood, for your support all these years, I thank you. Let&#39;s drink to this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joseph, we&#39;ve walked side by side for many years,&#34;Sherwood replied with feeling. &#34;I&#39;ve watched your devotion to your family, and now your dream fulfilled -I couldn&#39;t be happier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Marisa before Joseph could answer, he added, &#34;Marisa, from this day on, enjoy the blessings before you. With children so devoted, your days will only grow more joyous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, he lifted his glass high. &#34;This toast is for you both! May the Sampson family&#39;s future shine ever brighter, and may our friendship endure for generations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Verena, Isaac, Luis, and Molly also raised their glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood tilted back his head, downing his wine in one smooth motion, swift and assured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the glass lowered, his expression shifted ever so slightly, a glint flashing in his eyes-fleeting,subtle,and gone before anyone noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Isaac, seated directly opposité him, happened to catch that instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he set down his glass, his gaze lifted almost by chance, and in that instant he caught Sherwood&#39;s fleeting expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his heart tightened with suspicion, Isaac remained calm, his face betraying nothing.</p>
