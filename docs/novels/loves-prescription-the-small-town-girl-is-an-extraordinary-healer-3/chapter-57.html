                <p>Kaia&#39;s eyebrows knitted together,confusion flickering across her face. &#34;Mom, what&#39;s gotten you all worked up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura could barely contain her excitement,her whole face lighting up. &#34;You won&#39;t believe it-Barrie Lyons called this morning. He&#39;s not only stepping in to fix the club mess, but he said he&#39;d drop by in two days to thank you himself for curing his leg!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously?&#34; Kaia blinked in surprise, and then broke into a wide, unstoppable smile. &#34;He&#39;s coming here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura laughed and tugged her over to the couch.&#34;Why would I make that up? If you&#39;re doubting me,ask your dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at Alec,Kaia immediately noticed the change.He seemed lighter, a genuine smile softening his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s telling the truth,&#34; Alec admitted, his tone gentle.&#34;Barrie couldn&#39;t stop praising you-said you&#39;re considerate, remarkable, and well-mannered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since Kaia&#39;s birth, Alec had considered her a lucky us charm. When fortune smiled on the family, he was sure she brought the blessing. That certainty faded over the years, but hearing Barrie&#39;s praise brought the old feeling rushing back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Alec, Kaia was the best thing that ever happened to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura squeezed Kaia&#39;s hand, still brimming with pride.&#34;And that&#39;s not all. Barrie even joked that it&#39;s a shame his grandson isn&#39;t good enough for you, or he&#39;d love for you to marry into their family. That&#39;s how highly he thinks of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compliments piling up, Kaia couldn&#39;t hide her delight.She smoothed her hair, chin tipping up with newfound confidence. &#34;Honestly, I&#39;ve never been short on admirers. If all my admirers from school lined up, we&#39;d have a traffic jam on the block. And I&#39;m no less than Slater. To say Slater is not good enough for me isn&#39;t exactly wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her playful confidence seemed to lift everyone&#39;s mood,leaving the whole house buzzing with pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s true,&#34; Laura said with a warm smile, reaching up to smooth Kaia&#39;s hair. &#34;But keep this in mind-humility and manners go a long way, especially with families like theirs. They notice those things. When Barrie visits,be sure you look your best.&#34; Her mother&#39;s advice rang true, and Kaia knew exactly what was at stake. The Willis family and the Lyons family lived in different worlds, and she understood how much appearances mattered. &#34;I get it, Mom. You don&#39;t have to worry. I&#39;ll keep my eyes and ears open,and I won&#39;t speak unless I need to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec and Laura exchanged a proud glance, grateful for a daughter who never made life difficult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their thoughts drifted-almost involuntarily-to Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to Kaia, their other daughter always seemed determined to go her own way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A complicated look passed over Alec&#39;s face. Only last night, he&#39;d argued with Laura about bringing Verena home no matter the cost. Now, after the call from the Lyons family, he hadn&#39;t brought it up once. If Verena wanted to walk out of their lives, maybe it was time to let her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s happiness was impossible to miss-her smile stretched wide, pride sparkling in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why should she worry about Verena having Isaac? The Lyons family&#39;s support meant far more, and now their own future felt secure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if the Bennett family was out of reach, Laura doubted Verena could cause trouble from a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling bold, she grabbed her phone and shot off a quick message to Verena.	&#34;You&#39;re really underestimating both your father and your sister. Just because you have Isaac doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re powerless.Don&#39;t count us out so quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, Verena gave a quick glance at Laura&#39;s message, her lips curling in a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yesterday, Laura played the part of the doting,humble mother; today, she strutted around as if she ruled the world.If that wasn&#39;t a warning sign, Verena didn&#39;t know what was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No response felt necessary. She locked her phone screen, dropped it onto the coffee table,and decided Laura&#39;s theatrics could wait for another day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour passed before lsaac showed up at her door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob arrived just a step behind, setting the medical kit down on the table, eyes darting between his boss and Verena, as if waiting for a signal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena flipped open the case, methodically checking every supply inside. &#34;Jacob, you&#39;ll want to wait in the car this time. We might be a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertain, Jacob lingered, looking to lsaac for guidance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief silence hung between them before lsaac caught Verena&#39;s steady gaze, the intensity in her eyes making him look away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can wait outside, Jacob,&#34; Isaac said. &#34;I&#39;ll call when we&#39;re finished here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Jacob disappeared down the hall, Verena gently pushed Isaac&#39;s wheelchair into the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warm,floral notes filled the air, wrapping them both in a sense of quiet intimacy. Isaac&#39;s attention drifted to the neatly made bed, the memory of their night together flashing in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could still recall how easily his hand had circled her slender waist-how small and delicate she&#39;d felt,held close beneath the sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever she lay against him, it was as if she weighed nothing at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every detail about her drew him in, except for that wild,unpredictable spirit that kept slipping through his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden rush of warmth danced along his ear as Verena&#39;s breath tickled his skin, making him go rigid Snapping out of his thoughts, Isaac realized she&#39;d come up behind him, her hands now resting firmly on his shoulders, her upper body pressed close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifted, catching a glimpse of her elegant fingers,splayed over his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment sent a rush of memories through him-too vivid, too intimate. For once, the ever-composed Isaac felt thrown off balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What...&#34; His voice cracked,rough around the edges.&#34;Uh...what is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena picked up on his nervousness with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe I should be asking you,&#34; she murmured, her tone playful. &#34;I must have said your name three times,and you didn&#39;t even blink. What&#39;s got you so distracted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac fumbled for a reply. &#34;It&#39;s nothing, just...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cut him off with a sly smnile, leaning in even closer, her words a secret meant only for him.&#34;Nothing? I&#39;m guessing you were replaying that night in your head. The way you held my hand-how close we were?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body pressed softly against his back, sending his pulse racing. So near, Verena could see the blush spreading across Isaac&#39;s cheeks and all the way to the tips of his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax, I&#39;m just messing with you.&#34; Verena straightened, her hands slipping away. &#34;Let&#39;s get started with your therapy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s shoulders eased as he let out a shaky breath,looking every bit the guilty kid caught in the act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, her voice close to his ear kept replaying that night in his mind-the teasing, the laughter, and how powerless he&#39;d felt against her charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Helping him settle on the bed, Verena carefully rolled up his shirt and reached for his belt buckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of alarm flashed across Isaac&#39;s face as he caught her wrists, voice a little breathless. &#34;Wait-what are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension rippled across his abdomen, muscles taut with anticipation and nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calm glance, Verena answered, &#34;I need to start your treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing he might be overreacting, he averted his gaze, his voice low. &#34;I don&#39;t remember ever needing to undress for this before...&#34; Her eyes sparkled with amusement. &#34;Things have changed. We used to focus just on your legs, but today&#39;s therapy targets a new area.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color rose in his cheeks, but he still didn&#39;t release her hands. &#34;Is that really necessary?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is. I need access to your lower abdomen,&#34; Verena replied plainly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Isaac hesitated, clearly torn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure we can&#39;t do this another way?&#34; he mumbled,almost hopeful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a gentle laugh,exasperation mingling with affection. &#34;Isaac, trust me-if you want to get better,you&#39;ll have to let me do my job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand still trapped hers, so Verena leaned in,locking eyes with him. &#34;Are you planning to avoid intimacy forever, or are you actually going to let me help you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rushed to Isaac&#39;s cheeks, and his grip slackened at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking the opportunity, Verena deftly unfastened his belt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faint click echoed between them, prompting lsaac us to snatch her wrists again, flustered. &#34;I can handle this part myself,&#34; he muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let him take over, watching as his black trousers slipped just enough to expose his lower abdomen Quietly, Verena dipped her fingers into a jar of herbal ointment-a formula she&#39;d painstakingly perfected these last few days, meant to target his condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His skin was hypersensitive to the touch, and even the cool, light pressure of her fingertips sent a shiver through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena leaned in close to make sure the ointment stayed put, the ends of her hair brushing his stomach and making him twitch with a mix of embarrassment and anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After smoothing the ointment, she rolled over a heat lamp,angling it toward him and switching it on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the medicine did its work, Verena crossed the room,picked up a small gift box, and carried it back to Isaac. Inside was a dark, elegant necktie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is for you,&#34; she said, placing the tie in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t new-just something he&#39;d left behind long ago in Clokron, after a night spent at her place when he refused to leave her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night before, Gavin had managed to return the tie, slipping it back into Verena&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac turned the fabric over in his fingers,remembering how,at Fortune Garden Restaurant,he&#39;d watched her tug the tie of the man she was with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color, the pattern-everything matched the one he held now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought nagged at lsaac-had she given that tie to the man?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze dropped, a faint frown shadowing his face</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even knowing the truth, he couldn&#39;t shake off the sting of jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning the tie over in his hands, he muttered, &#34;You hand these out to everyone, or am I special?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena caught the low rumble of his voice and looked over,brow raised. &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced away, voice even softer. &#34;It&#39;s nothing.Forget it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s laughter was light. &#34;You&#39;re seriously going to act like that? Why on earth would you think I&#39;m giving ties to half the city?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Isaac stayed quiet, fingers tracing the fabric. Then, almost reluctantly, he spoke up.&#34;|saw you at the restaurant. The guy sitting across from you had a tie just like this. Did you give him one too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His last words sounded almost wounded-more boyish than he meant to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s smile widened as she leaned in, eyes sparkling with mischief. &#34;Isaac, don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re actually jealous.&#34;</p>
