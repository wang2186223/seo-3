                <p>Tobin guided Verena toward the rear of the estate,where they were met by a spotless white building gleaming in the sunlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping inside, Verena noticed it resembled an ordinary hospital-only here,the extravagance spoke of wealth poured in without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the spacious ward, a celebrated local physician-entrusted solely with the care of Maxton-was in the middle of a physical examination, while a nurse quietly refreshed the vases of flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Tobin&#39;s arrival, the doctor lifted his head and offered a polite nod. &#34;Good day, Mr. Fairclough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin returned the courtesy before asking, &#34;Dr. Smith,how is my father&#39;s condition today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Britton Smith gave a weary sigh and slowly shook his head.&#34;The same as always. No sign of improvement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of those words darkened Tobin&#39;s face,sorrow clouding his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his despair, Verena discreetly squeezed his  wrist, urging him to steady himself. He then said, &#34;Dr.Smith, this is my girlfriend. I&#39;d like her to spend some time talking with my father. Would you all step outside for a moment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a request that carried reason, and Britton found no grounds to object. He inclined his head. &#34;We&#39;ll be right outside. If anything happens, Mr. Fairclough,simply use the call bell by the bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he gestured to the nurses, and together they left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the door clicked softly shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena released Tobin&#39;s arm, turning to grab the nearby medical devices. &#34;I need to perform a thorough examination on your father. Keep an eye on the door for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obedient to her words, Tobin moved to the doorway,his anxious gaze never leaving her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena slipped on a stethoscope, every line of her face marked by focus as she examined Maxton carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes later, she set the equipment back in place and gave Tobin a steady nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rushed to her side, nerves straining his voice.&#34;Well? Can you cure him?&#34; Verena&#39;s reply came with firm assurance. &#34;I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone lit a spark in him, a flicker of hope blazing into joy. He seized Maxton&#39;s hand with trembling excitement. &#34;Dad, did you hear that? You&#39;ll wake up soon-you&#39;ll get better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Verena tempered his elation with calm words.&#34;Although your brother has momentarily set aside his doubts about me, he is a man who trusts no one. To guard against trouble, we must carry out the confidential procedure as soon as possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin understood. Until his father truly awoke, nothing could be revealed to Erick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clasped Maxton&#39;s hand tighter, whispering with resolve, &#34;Don&#39;t worry. It won&#39;t be long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wishing to stir suspicion by lingering too long, the two concluded their visit and quietly left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in Shoildon, Stevie had arranged a swim with friends, but one by one they declined.Frustrated,he decided to swim alone. After a few laps, boredom crept in, and he climbed ashore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stretching out on a beach chair, he picked up his phone to tackle some overseas work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had he unlocked it than a notification leapt   across the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The headline shouted, &#34;The First Appearance of the Mysterious Girlfriend of Tobin Fairclough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tobin Fairclough?&#34; Stevie frowned,perplexed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never met Tobin, but his reputation was familiar enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t he always painted by the press as a grieving widower, devoted to his late wife and untouched by romance?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who could possibly change that tale?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity burning, Stevie tapped the article.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The images within nearly sent him tumbling from his chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at the photos, his jaw slack with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman leaning on Tobin-though masked and wearing sunglasses-bore a figure and mannerisms that were unmistakably known to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The report even carried a short video, which Stevie played with trembling fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, a woman in sunglasses waved at Tobin, and he  responded with endearment, calling her,&#34;Sweetheart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stevie felt his world tilt. If the photos had left a sliver of doubt, the voice erased it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in a sharp breath, he exclaimed, &#34;Impossible!How could Isaac&#39;s wife be there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And worse-foreign media declared her Tobin&#39;s mysterious girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing something gravely amiss, Stevie wasted no time.He forwarded the news to Isaac and immediately called him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the call connected, his voice burst out in haste. &#34;Quick! Look at the message I just sent!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, baffled, asked, &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearly shouting,Stevie pressed, &#34;Just check it! Your wife is being taken right under your nose!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, unsettled, opened his laptop and clicked on Stevie&#39;s chat window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A foreign tabloid article?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows drew together as he followed the link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Isaac kept silent, Stevie urged anxiously, &#34;Did you see it? Did you?&#34; Isaac&#39;s throat tightened, but his voice remained calm.&#34;Yes,I saw.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Stevie was stunned-then burst out,&#34;Are you serious? Your wife is holding another man&#39;s hand, being paraded as his girlfriend, and you sit there calm as a monk? Love must have blinded you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint pang tugged at Isaac&#39;s heart as he stared at the photo,yet he held on to composure.He remembered Verena&#39;s words before her departure-she would need a false identity abroad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though confused, he chose to trust her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not what you imagine,&#34; he said softly. &#34;Verena warned me beforehand. Her identity there is a mask,nothing more. I know this, so set your worries aside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stevie, however, couldn&#39;t fathom it. What man would watch quietly as his wife clung to another?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Skepticism laced his tone. &#34;You&#39;re sure about that?Not just bewitched by love?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac allowed himself a faint smile. &#34;I&#39;m not the fool you take me for. I trust her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Stevie could only concede. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ve passed on the news. What happens next is between you two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac thanked him, and the call ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence wrapped around Isaac&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lingered on the photo, shadows flickering in their depth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned his phone in his hand, weighing his thoughts,before finally making a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had just stepped out of the Fairclough family&#39;s hospital when the device buzzed in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the caller ID, her lips curvingfaintly,and then pressed to hang up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the tone of disconnection, Isaac froze in disbelief, his brows furrowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he reached to dial again, a message appeared on his screen. &#34;I&#39;m being watched right now and can&#39;t talk on the phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tension eased slightly, and he typed back, &#34;I saw the news report from abroad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena marveled at how swiftly the press moved, yet she feared Isaac might stilI harbor unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patiently,she explained, &#34;Isaac, this is what I warned you about. I must pretend to be close to Tobin,fooling his brother in order to reach my goal.&#34; Meanwhile,Erick, noticing Tobin and his girlfriend had yet to return, walked toward the hospital at the back of the estate, suspicion stirring in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crossing the back garden, he spotted them at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin lingered behind, issuing orders to the servants,while the woman in front was busy on her phone,her eyes sharp and alert. She seemed different from the naive girl from earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as she typed, Verena sensed someone approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without betraying it, she slipped the phone away and lifted her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile appeared on her face as she stepped forward,her tone almost eager. &#34;Erick, are you here to visit your father as well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick ignored her question, his eyes narrowing as he sneered, &#34;Don&#39;t act like we&#39;re close. My brother&#39;s interest is nothing more than a passing fancy. You&#39;d better play the role of a companion and not dream of climbing into the Fairclough family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the edge in his words, Verena answered gently, &#34;I assure you, I see things more clearly than you believe.&#34; His frown deepened, suspicion flashing in his gaze as though her mask had slipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he was about to speak, Verena smiled ingratiatingly and added, &#34;I know my place. I&#39;m aware of the gulf between a companion and a wife. If what I seek can be gained easily with the title of a companion,why would I make life difficult by reaching for more?&#34;</p>
