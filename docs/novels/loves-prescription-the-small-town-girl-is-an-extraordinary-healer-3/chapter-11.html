                <p>A faint, bitter smile tugged at Danica&#39;s lips. Isaac was her son, and pretending she didn&#39;t care was impossible. But what good was caring when she understood, better than anyone, that the car accident had cost him more than just the use of his legs?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She closed her eyes, the doctor&#39;s words still echoing clearly in her mind-the day she found out the crash had also left Isaac with sexual dysfunction. The mix of helplessness and heartbreak had left her feeling empty inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News of Isaac&#39;s leg injury alone had already sent the media into a frenzy. If news of his sexual dysfunction ever spread, there was no predicting how cruel the rumors would get, or how fast public opinion could turn against their family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, she had two sons, but their strengths were painfully mismatched. Isaac had the talent to lead but couldn&#39;t produce an heir, stripping him of the right to inherit the company. Bobby had the ability to continue the bloodline but lacked the strategic mind for leadership.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, Danica vowed to herself that no one would ever learn about Isaac&#39;s condition. Determined to secure Isaac&#39;s future and keep the company stabe, she acted fast, arranging a marriage planned down to the finest detail. The Willis family was the match she chose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she followed Bobby&#39;s advice and sought a match with a lady from a powerful, equal-status family, she couldn&#39;t be certain they wouldn&#39;t one day use Isaac&#39;s secret against them. Women from those circles often came with sharp minds, deep schemes, and dangerous family backing. The Willis family, on the other hand,was easy to handle in both power and intellect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Verena, raised in a backward region, was either blissfully unaware of the manipulations of city life or too inexperienced to take part in them. A bride like that would be the easiest to control. Even if Verena eventually learned about Isãac&#39;s condition, Danica was confident she could ensure the girl stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was something Danica had no intention of letting Bobby find out. Letting out a slow sigh, she said, &#34;You&#39;re still too young. Even if I explained, you wouldn&#39;t grasp the whole picture. Just concentrate on preparing yourself for the company. Isaac&#39;s issues are between him and me.Don&#39;t get yourself involved. Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have a meeting to attend to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Bobby could get a word in, she ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glaring at the ended call, Bobby felt irritation churn inside him. Every conversation played out the same.She talked to him as if he were a child, leaving him feeling small and dismissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration burned in Bobby&#39;s chest, and he spat out a curse before tossing his phone aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, the phone struck the steering wheel, jolting it just enough to send the car swerving off course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, his heart jumped as he spotted a pedestrian right in his path. Bobby then jerked the wheel at the last second, barely avoiding them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right as he was about to breathe a sigh of relief, the car smashed into the roadside barrier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The airbag burst open, but the sudden swerve sent his head hitting the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby felt a warm trickle slide down his temple, and within moments, his vision blurred and faded to nothingness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shouts erupted as nearby pedestrians rushed toward the wreck. Someone was already dialing for an ambulance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, bored and out for a drive, slowed when she spotted several cars stopped ahead. She rolled her window down, curious about the commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a voice rang out over the noise of traffic. &#34;Is there a doctor here? Please! Someone&#39;s been in an accident!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An accident? Verena&#39;s brow furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She unclipped her seatbelt in one swift motion and pushed through the gathering crowd. The wrecked vehicle was a red Ferrari. Through the cracked glass, Verena spotted the driver slumped unconscious behind the wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the bystanders, she said firmly, &#34;The front&#39;s taken a bad hit. There&#39;s a chance the fuel line&#39;s damaged, and it might catch fire. We have to get him out right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, a few sturdy men immediately moved forward to assist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lay him flat,&#34; Verena instructed. &#34;And avoid putting pressure on his chest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the man was clear of the car, she dropped to her knees beside him, unbuttoning his clothes layer by layer until she reached his undershirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly lifted his eyelids, checked his breathing, and immediately started CPR.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When two complete cycles failed to get a response from the injured man, she continued without pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her composure and precision mirrored the calm efficiency of a trained emergency responder, easing the fear of those watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally,faint movement flickered in Bobby&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena noticed it instantly, exhaling a quiet breath of relief. He was coming back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his haze, Bobby felt like he was stuck in a nightmare. Every heartbeat sent a fresh wave of pain through his skull. A calm, steady voice urged him toward awareness, cool in tone but strangely captivating. Curiosity pulled at him, and with effort, he pried his eyes open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Bobby&#39;s eyes finally opened, Verena gave him a warm smile. &#34;Good, you&#39;re awake. How are you feeling? Any pain or discomfort?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was calm and held a soft concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby simply looked at her, blinking like he&#39;d momentarily forgotten how to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking he was still groggy from regaining consciousness, Verena asked again,&#34;Other than your head,do you feel pain anywhere else?&#34; Her voice filled Bobby&#39;s ears, soft and reassuring, while his gaze stayed fixed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One clear thought settled firmly in his mind-this was exactly what he imagined a perfect sister-in-law should be! Beautiful, elegant, kind, and offering just the right touch of care. Only such a woman was worthy of Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena noticed his unwavering gaze and assumed the accident had left him dazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wail of an approaching siren broke the moment, and the ambulance pulled in beside them. Without drawing attention to herself, she eased back into the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby wanted to call out, to ask her name, but the paramedics quickly lifted him onto a stretcher and into the ambulance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the sidewalk, Verena watched the vehicle speed away. A faint crease appeared between her brows.Was it just her imagination, or had that young man&#39;s face looked strangely familiar, like someone she&#39;d seen before?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the hospital called, Isaac ordered a driver to take him there without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he reached the ward, he found Bobby lounging on the bed, casually munching on a banana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he spotted Isaac, Bobby hurriedly tossed the fruit aside. &#34;Isaac, you&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t answer right away. Instead, he turned to his assistant. &#34;Step outside for now. I&#39;ll call if I need you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a respectful nod, the assistant slipped out, closing the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling his wheelchair forward, Isaac stopped directly in front of Bobby. His eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of the bandage wrapped around Bobby&#39;s head. &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pang of guilt flickered through Bobby. Ever since the accident that had taken their father&#39;s life and left Isaac in a wheelchair, the family had been overly cautious about driving. If Isaac knew he&#39;d been in another accident,he&#39;d worry for sure.Forcing a grin, Bobby waved it off. &#34;It&#39;s nothing,just a scratch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac stayed quiet, his gaze locked on Bobby, unblinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby could feel the truth clawing at his throat, and lying to Isaac was impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking away, his eyes shifted uneasily. &#34;I just accidentally crashed into the roadside barrier and ended up with a mnild concussion. Nothing serious, just a minor accident.&#34;</p>
