                <p>With those wards, he approached Molly and gripped her shoulders furmly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning closer, he locked eyes with her directly.His stare held paternal authority. though underneath lurked unmistakable traces of desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Molly.&#34; His voice plummeted suddenly, becoming gravelly with emotion. &#34;My precious daughter,consider this carefully. Can you honestly stand by and watch your father perish? Between Luis and me, are you genuinely prepared to sacrifice your own father&#39;s life?&#34; His grip unconsciously intensified as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly trembled beneath Sherwood&#39;s penetrating gaze,her face contorting with internal warfare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, Sherwood represented her sole protection against life&#39;s cruelest storms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing her father-the person who cherished her most-remained unthinkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly found herself completely torn, tears welling in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis occupied one side of her heart with deep romantic love,while her father claimed the other with years of devoted care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Complete paralysis seized her in that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following a prolonged silence, Molly finally managed to speak. &#34;But Dad, resorting to criminal methods could expose everything and destroy our entire family.I can&#39;t bear losing you,but...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly attempted to continue her plea, but Sherwood spun away and raised his palm to silence her. &#34;Not another word. These matters are beyond your understanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone carried absolute finality, severing Molly&#39;s  protest before it could fully form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognizing his excessive harshness, Sherwood turned back toward Molly, his stern mask dissolving into genuine warmth. He reached out to stroke her hair with the tenderness reserved for consoling a hurt child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For now, simply stay home and find ways to relax.Read your books, watch your programs, pursue whatever brings you joy.&#34; His voice softened considerably, adopting an almost indulgent quality.&#34;Once this business concludes, I&#39;ll arrange an extended overseas vacation. We&#39;ll visit any destination you choose, and you can properly decompress.Upon our return, I&#39;ll introduce you to someone who matches Luis in every way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood pressed on with growing confidence. &#34;I guarantee that whether considering family background or personal capabilities, this person equals Luis completely. You might discover instant chemistry,and before long, Luis will become nothing but a distant memory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly absorbed her father&#39;s elaborate plans with her chin tucked low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silent rebellion churned within her heart, knowing that nobody except Luis could ever claimn that place in her life. Molly stole a cautious look at Sherwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his expression appeared warm and caring,Molly understood this facade didn&#39;t guarantee his temper remained under control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivid memories surfaced of her childhood accident when she&#39;d shattered Sherwood&#39;s prized collectible.Her typically gentle father had transformed into a terrifying stranger within seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That twisted mask of rage and his bone-rattling fury still haunted her dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that defining moment, she&#39;d learned that beneath her father&#39;s everyday kindness lurked someone utterly dangerous when pushed beyond his limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This realization made Molly&#39;s hands curl into tight fists without conscious thought, her nails carving painful crescents into her palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within an exclusive VIP lounge of an upscale Ochrerayd nightclub, Isaac maintained perfect posture on the corner sofa, his expression completely unreadable. His composed presence created a stark contrast to the wild celebrations echoing beyond the soundproof doors. A plainly dressed operative approached Isaac with quick, efficient steps, bowing respectfully before delivering his report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Bennett, your suspicions proved accurate.Sherwood arranged for a body double, someone matching his exact build and clothing, to execute this elaborate ruse. Their initial move involved taking a black vehicle to a downtown club. The decoy entered the establishment while the real Sherwood slipped away and climbed into a beat-up silver van.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The operative paused, collecting his thoughts before continuing. &#34;That van drove straight toward the city&#39;s edge before pulling into some isolated private club.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This information prompted Isaac to uncross his legs and lean forward with renewed interest, pushing for more details. &#34;What kind of business was conducted inside that facility?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s head dipped respectfully as he delivered his explanation with evident caution. &#34;Mr. Bennett, we couldn&#39;t risk getting too close. That place is crawling with dangerous people, and there&#39;s bound to be plenty of informants mixed in with the crowd. Our only option was maintaining surveillance from the perimeter. Sherwood remained inside for nearly an hour before finally emerging and returning via the same silver van.&#34; Isaac settled back against the plush sofa cushions, his penetrating stare cutting through his drink&#39;s amber surface as his mind processed the intelligence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they had monitored Sherwood&#39;s movements for this long, his panicked reaction to news about Howe came as no surprise whatsoever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood had spent decades mastering corporate warfare, building an extensive network of allies and maintaining a spotless public reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Howe represented his single greatest vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Operating under Sherwood&#39;s direct commands,Howe had committed countless felonies, including the vicious actions of taking Verena away from her parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that they&#39;d strategically leaked Howe&#39;s confession regarding the incriminating evidence he possessed, Sherwood&#39;s agitation was completely predictable, and his desperate countermeasures were inevitable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyebrow lifted slightly as he murmured to himself, &#34;Looks like it&#39;s time to begin drawing them into our trap... gradually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following a moment of contemplative silence, he  reached into his jacket&#39;s inner pocket, elegant fingers dancing across his phone screen to connect with Luis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call went through immediately, and Isaac spoke without preamble. &#34;Luis, my surveillance team followed Sherwood to some club in the suburbs last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>′′Asuburban club?&#34; Luis&#39; voice carried obvious skepticism through the connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly.Since Ochrerayd falls under your jurisdiction,I can&#39;t just charge in blindly. This investigation belongs to you. Sherwood&#39;s too clever to choose that location randomly. He selected that remote club for specific reasons. Investigate everyone connected to that establishment, from employees to regular customers.Leave no stone unturned. The answers we need might be hiding in plain sight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; Luis confirmed. &#34;Rest assured, I&#39;ll dispatch a team immediately. We&#39;ll tear that establishment apart piece by piece.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect.Maintain tight surveillance on Sherwood, but don&#39;t tip him off.&#34; Isaac&#39;s tone grew more cautious.&#34;He&#39;s already heightened his defenses. One wrong move could send him running. We need to capitalize on his current vulnerability and force him into making desperate choices.&#34; &#34;No need to worry,&#34; Luis assured him. &#34;I&#39;ve got experienced operatives handling this assignment.There won&#39;t be any slip-ups. You&#39;ll hear from me the second we uncover anything significant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gave his approval. &#34;Excellent. I&#39;ll await your report.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both men terminated the connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Sampson Group, Luis tucked his phone into his trouser pocket and pushed himself up from his chair.One hand braced against his desk while the other reached for the landline receiver, just as someone rapped on his office door.</p>
