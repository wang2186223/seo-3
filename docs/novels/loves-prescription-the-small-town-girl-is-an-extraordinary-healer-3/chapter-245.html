                <p>Beneath the low ceiling of Evelyn Model Hospital&#39;s underground garage, the air was heavy with silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis lounged against the sleek side of his car, one leg crossed over the other with careless elegance. A cigar rested between his fingers, while his other hand slipped into the pocket of his tailored trousers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze was lowered,half-lidded,as though he were weighing thoughts too dark to share.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, he lifted the cigar to his lips and drew in a slow breath, letting the smoke roll lazily from his mouth,twisting into the dim glow of the garage lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every so often, a sly, unreadable smile curved across his face, vanishing as quickly as it appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rhythm of hurried footsteps suddenly broke the quiet,echoing off the concrete walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; eyes snapped open, sharp and alert, settling on the figure rushing toward him. With the smallest twist of his fingers, he snuffed out the cigar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Simon close the distance, he allowed a  smirk to tug at his lips. &#34;Didn&#39;t think you&#39;d show up this quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It meant that Verena indeed mattered even more to Simon than Luis had thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words landed like a challenge, and Simon knew at once that Luis hadn&#39;t come by chance. His showing up here, demanding Evelyn&#39;s presence, was far too deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis had figured something out. He must have sensed the truth Simon tried so hard to bury-that Verena was not just a colleague to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no matter how far Luis tried to push,Simon swore he&#39;d never let Verena pay the price for their feud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage surged through him, his eyes rimmed red as his voice broke into a roar. He looked like a cornered animal ready to fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You stay the hell away from Verena!&#34; he shouted,glaring at Luis with venom. &#34;You think you can use her to play your games? Is that what this is about? Looking for your sister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s jaw clenched tight, the words spilling from between his teeth like venom. &#34;Take one more step toward her, and I&#39;ll make sure your sister never lives to see daylight again.&#34; The instant Simon mentioned his sister, the careless amusement in Luis&#39; eyes vanished, replaced by a feral blaze that burned hot and merciless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a speed that gave Simon no chance to react,Luis&#39; hand shot forward and clamped around his throat,squeezing so tightly it seemed Simon&#39;s windpipe might snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heartbeat later, Simon&#39;s head was driven against the car window with brutal force, the sound of bone striking glass echoing again and again through the empty garage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; grip didn&#39;t falter; his strength was overwhelming,every movement filled with cold intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The window rattled under the repeated impact, its surface quivering as though it might splinter at any moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you really think dragging my sister into this would frighten me?&#34; Luis snapped, his narrowed eyes gleaming with lethal menace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You schemed to push me against Isaac because of Verena, didn&#39;t you? You love her so much you&#39;ll risk everything for her? Fine. Then maybe I&#39;ll end her life first-and watch whether you still dare touch my sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The venom in those words struck Simon like a blade,  cutting into the place he was most vulnerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face turned a deep shade of red, his eyes bulging with panic and fury as the lack of oxygen stole his strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scratched at Luis&#39; iron grip with frantic desperation,forcing out a hoarse growl. &#34;Isaac... won&#39;t ever let you hurt her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the words left his mouth, Simon was struck by a heavy sense of helplessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter if it was Luis or Isaac standing before him,he always seemed to be nothing more than a piece on their board, moved at their will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when he thought he had their weakness in his grasp, they somehow managed to turn the situation around in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the distant look clouding Simon&#39;s face, Luis lifted his chin with quiet arrogance,his stare locking firmly on him as though to drive the point home.&#34;You said it yourself. I don&#39;t need to play fair when it comes to Isaac. If I decide Verena&#39;s life is mine to take,I can think of a hundred ways to end it. Go on, test me, and you&#39;ll find out just how far I&#39;ll go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s glare burned hotter than fire, his face twisted with rage, veins throbbing at his temples as though he were seconds away from exploding. The sight only seemed to thrill Luis further, a cruel spark lighting in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on,&#34; he said suddenly, tilting his head with a mock look of thought. &#34;Killing Verena might be too easy. If you&#39;re that obsessed with her... wouldn&#39;t it break you more if I took her for myself instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suggestion made Simon&#39;s eyes blaze with such fury it was as if he could set Luis alight on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers clawed helplessly at the hand crushing his throat, each rasp of breath dragging out ina hoarse,broken sound that carried both desperation and hate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body shook as he forced the words out, his voice unsteady. &#34;Go ahead... I dare you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; voice dropped to a chilling calm. &#34;For my sister&#39;s sake, there isn&#39;t a line I wouldn&#39;t cross.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fist shot forward in the next instant, smashing into Simon&#39;s face with brutal force. &#34;Tell me now-where is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blow sent blood spilling from Simon&#39;s mouth,yet instead of defeat, a twisted laugh erupted from him,dark and bitter. &#34;No wonder they call you king of the underworld. You strike hard,you strike smart-you know how to make people break. But you seem to forget something...&#34; Lifting his head, he stared up with wild,unflinching eyes, a crooked smile pulling at his lips. &#34;I&#39;m insane.I have nothing to lose. Weakness doesn&#39;t matter to a madman,because I&#39;ll always have a way to make you bleed. You think Verena can be your weapon against me? Think again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon raised his chin defiantly, his voice dripping with venom. &#34;If Verena dies, I&#39;ll drag your sister into the grave with her. And if you ever dare lay a hand on Verena, I&#39;ll unleash the filthiest scum on earth on your sister until she suffers worse than anything you can imagine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; rage exploded like a gunshot, and before Simon could even draw his next breath, his fists came crashing down in a violent barrage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every strike was heavier than the last, each one powered by pure fury, slamming into Simon&#39;s stomach with bone-cracking force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon coughed out a mouthful of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And still, through the blood, a jagged laugh spiled from Simon&#39;s mouth. &#34;Ha... ha... I&#39;ve already won.None of you can stoop as low as I can. You cling to your sister&#39;s safety, but I&#39;ve got nothing left to lose.If Verena is dragged through hell, then your sister will be  dragged right beside her-and I&#39;ll burn the both of us to ash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of his laughter scraped against the walls of the garage, cruel and jarring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; fists didn&#39;t stop, pummeling until Simon&#39;s face was twisted between agony and defiance.Even beaten down, Simon managed to spit out his venom.&#34;Mr.Sampson, stop lying to yourself. There&#39;s only one path if you want answers about your sister. Take my bargain,join me against Isaac, and keep your filthy hands away from Verena. If you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll never know peace,and neither will your sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing him by the collar, Luis slammed him back against the car door, his eyes blazing with disgust as he hissed through clenched teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Crazy bastard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s words weren&#39;t empty bluffs-he would actually follow through with such twisted threats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; hand quivered at his side, his knuckles aching from the blows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t risk it. No matter what it took, he wouldn&#39;t gamble with his sister&#39;s life.</p>
