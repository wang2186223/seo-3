                <p>As Verena mulled over Isaac&#39;s condition, a set of quick footsteps rang out in the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to find Danica and Bobby hurrying toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Isaac&#39;s condition might be caused by his mental state, it made sense for his family to be involved.Right after Isaac was taken to the exam room, Verena had made sure to call them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica remained dressed in her business suit, a clear sign she had hurried straight over from the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was shaky with worry. &#34;Verena, what&#39;s happened to Isaac?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby chimed in, just as tense, &#34;Yeah, didn&#39;t the surgery go well? Why isn&#39;t my brother able to stand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena recognized their worries, but as a doctor, she knew panic had no place right now. What mattered most was uncovering the cause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met Danica&#39;s gaze, her voice steady. &#34;Danica, the operation went smoothly. Isaac&#39;s wounds are healing perfectly, and he should be starting rehab today. But something&#39;s keeping him from getting up, and it isn&#39;t physical.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena paused for a moment, and then continued, &#34;If all the tests come back clear, we&#39;re likely looking at a psychological hurdle, Danica, I heed you to walk me through everything that happened the day of Isaac&#39;s accident. It could be the missing piece we need for him to move forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica gave several quick nods before saying,&#34;Okay, I&#39;Il tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes grew distant as the memories flooded back, tears gathering as she recounted the events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I got there, Isaac and his father were in the back seat. A truck had slammed into their car on the overpass, killing the driver on impact. My husband had thrown himself over lsaac to shield him,creating just enough space to protect him. His body was crushed, both legs skewered by metal rods from the truck, one even went through Isaac&#39;s thigh. My husband&#39;s blood was all over him... and he died before he could say a single word. Isaac was the only one who made it out alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wiping her eyes, Danica&#39;s voice cracked. &#34;He hasn&#39;t been able to walk since then. He shut everyone out,barely talked to us. Things only started to change after you came into his life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby tried to comfort her, tears rolling down his face. &#34;Mom, Isaac&#39;s going to pull through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the story, Verena felt her own eyes sting as a deep ache settled in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to Danica&#39;s story, Verena understood that Isaac&#39;s struggles all traced back to the accident, a trauma that had left him unable to move forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe that was why he couldn&#39;t remember her, either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Isaac was ever going to stand again, he&#39;d have to confront the pain he carried inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica worried that, even after such a successful operation, Isaac might stumble at this crucial point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice shook with desperation as she turned to Verena. &#34;What should we do now? How can we help Isaac?&#34;	A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing how on edge Danica was, Verena kept her voice gentle. &#34;You don&#39;t have to be afraid. Isaac&#39;s made a full physical recovery. What&#39;s left is for him to face what&#39;s happening in his mind. I&#39;ll be there every step of the way. Let me handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bit of hope flickered in Danica&#39;s eyes. Tears of relief welled up as she repeated her gratitude. &#34;Thank you,Verena.I really believe you&#39;ll hel him through this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the exam room door swung open and Julianna rolled Isaac out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julianna gave Danica a borief nod, and then told Verena directly, &#34;Evelyn, everything came back normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should I gather the team so we can plan our next steps?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena took the results in stride; they were exactly what she&#39;d expected. It was clear now that the problem was psychological.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her gaze, she replied, &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary, Julianna. I know what to do. You go ahead and get back to your work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julianna gave a quick nod. &#34;Of course. If you need help, just let me know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica and Bobby hurried over to lsaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac, how are you feeling?&#34; Danica&#39;s voice was gentle as she squeezed his arm. &#34;You look thinner than before.I&#39;Il cook your favorite meals and bring them to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac looked as if he wanted to say something, but Bobby spoke up first, bowing his head apologetically.&#34;Isaac, I promise to listen to you from now on. I&#39;ll focus on school and start learning about the company during my breaks. I won&#39;t make you worry about me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s usual stern look faded, replaced by soft affection in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Bobby&#39;s attitude had changed; his words were-quiet, careful not to upset Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t normally act like that. Isaac&#39;s brows knitted together without him realizing, puzzled by their sudden shift in behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were they treating him with such caution because they didn&#39;t believe he&#39;d recover?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching his mother and brother walk on eggshells around him, Isaac felt a heavy wave of helplessness and grief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let his gaze fall and gave a quiet sigh. &#34;You don&#39;t have to act so carefully. When I first woke up after the accident,I accepted everything that had happened. Life in a wheelcair isn&#39;t the end. I&#39;ve been down this road before; it&#39;s just something familiar now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile touched his lips. &#34;Honestly, I&#39;m fine. I&#39;ve got Verena and our baby by my side. I haven&#39;t lost hope, and I plan to make the most of every day. So don&#39;t feel sorry for me. Just keep living your lives like you always have.&#34; But his words, meant to reassure, only deepened Danica&#39;s and Bobby&#39;s sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of them was a doctor, and neither truly understood the battles Isaac was fighting inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being his family, they couldn&#39;t help but fear that lsaac might end up confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When there was no hope, it had been easier to accept. But now, with the possibility of a miracle so close,the reality was even harder to swallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena watched Isaac trying to smile for his family&#39;s sake, and her heart ached for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved closer, resting a comforting hand on his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac, it isn&#39;t what you think,&#34; she said gently. &#34;Your exams show you&#39;re completely healthy. After the operation, your legs healed perfectly; they&#39;re no different from anyone else&#39;s now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No different from anyone else&#39;s?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words caught Isaac off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then why couldn&#39;t he stand? Catching Isaac&#39;s puzzled look, Verena spoke gently.&#34;Dyou recall what happened during the car accident?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s expression shifted, memories flickering behind his eyes. She continued, &#34;The reason you can&#39;t walk isn&#39;t physical. You&#39;re struggling with something deep inside. That kind of obstacle can be overcome, and you&#39;re not alone. Our hospital has a specialist who works with both physical and emotional healing. I&#39;arrange everything for you, and I&#39;ll stay by your side through it all. There&#39;s nothing to be afraid of; I&#39;lI be with you every step.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reassurance settled over him like gentle spring rain, washing some of the pain away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flush of emotion brightened Isaac&#39;s eyes. At that moment, it didn&#39;t matter to him if her heart belonged to someone else. All he needed was her care and presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out, brushing her cheek softly. &#34;Alright,I&#39;ll trust you and do whatever you say.&#34;</p>
