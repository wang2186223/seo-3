                <p>Verena lowered her head, her fingers interlacing unconsciously as though trying to anchor the storm within.Her eyes drifted aimlessly, as if searching for clarity among the jumble of emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This came like a bolt from the blue, without a whisper of warning, leaving me utterly unprepared.&#34; After pausing to collect herself, she added slowwly, &#34;Even I struggle to put my feelings into words. Shock,uncertainty, and confusion... all tangled together, leaving me at a complete loss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally lifted her gaze toward Luis, determination flickered beneath the sincerity in her eyes.&#34;I know you want me to slip seamlessly into this family, but | can&#39;t. For years, I&#39;ve lived in another world, with my own rhythm, my own ties. To suddenly turn my back on all of that, to embrace a brand-new family,I need time-plenty of time-to find my footing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drew a breath and pressed on. &#34;Mr. Sampson, I hope you&#39;ll understand and grant me the space to process this, to redefine what our bond truly means.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis stood rooted, his hands hanging loosely at his sides, the confident pride that once defined him now reduced to a shadow, tinged®with defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories crowded his mind-moments with Verena that now stung like reproaches. He had chastised himself countless times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they first met, he had left nothing but a poor impression, even uttering careless remarks that now echoed like ghosts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had only himself to blame if she found it hard to accept him-or even this newfound kinship-because of the stains he had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze fell, and a heavy sigh escaped his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, he lifted his head again, guilt flickering in his eyes as he met hers. &#34;I understand, Verena. Of course, I do. Everything happened so quickly you barely had time to catch your breath. It&#39;s only natural. Don&#39;t worry-I won&#39;t force your hand. I&#39;ll give you time, as much as you need, until your heart allows you to accept me and this family in your own way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; Verena glanced at her watch and added, &#34;Mr. Sampson, I have matters to attend to, so I won&#39;t see you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she turned and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her office, Verena sat quietly, her eyes clouded with mixed emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She unfastened her buttons, slipped off her white coat, folded it neatly, and placed it in the wardrobe.Without hesitation, she walked to the rack, pulled down her outer coat, and zipped it up in one smooth motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Julianna returned from her rounds. Spotting Verena ready to leave, she asked in surprise,&#34;Evelyn, are you heading out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena turned with measured calm. &#34;Yes, I have some things to handle. I&#39;ll leave everything here in your care for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, she added, &#34;If anything urgent arises at the hospital, call me immediately. I&#39;ll return as soon as possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up her phone and bag, and then walked briskly toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short while later, a silver-gray car rolled out of the hospital&#39;s underground parking lot and merged onto the main road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside Wilis Villa, sunlight spilled across the lush green lawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several middle-aged maids in uniform crouched by the flowerbeds, trimming the blossoms with meticulous care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A younger maid nearby swept fallen leaves and dust with practiced strokes. The sudden roar of an engine broke the calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The younger maid froze mid-sweep, glancing toward the sound. A silver-gray car was drawing near.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It slowed, finally stopping neatly in the open space before the villa</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened, and Verena stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wore a plain white long-sleeved top, loose casual trousers, and a finely knit black cardigan-simple yet elegant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was bare of makeup, radiant in its natural glow, her skin touched with a soft flush, and her eyes bright with quiet depth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition dawned at once on the maid&#39;s face. Lighting up, she hurried forward, bowing slightly with eager words. &#34;Mrs. Bennett, welcome back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commotion drew the others, who quickly followed, their flattering tones ringing sharply against the memory of their past indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s expression remained calm, her eyes unreadable, as she walked straight to the villa&#39;s entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew all too well-their sudden warmth was born not of respect but of convenience. Her brilliant showing at the hospital opening, her rising reputation as a famous doctor, and her marriage to lsaac had transformed their scorn into obsequious praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ugly duckling they had once dismissed had become a swan they now scrambled to revere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally, their stance shifted with the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kylee,catching sight of Verena, dropped her shears and hurried into the villa, eager to announce her arrival to Alec and Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunlight streamed through the tall windows, bathing the Willis living room in a golden glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec, in a dark gray suit, sat by a luxurious coffee table, his hands deftly working with a set of fine coffee utensils. Across the room, Laura lounged beside a pile of colorful scarves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in luxurious silk loungewear, she draped a sapphire scarf over her shoulders, turning this way and that before the mirror, murmuring about which shade best suited her elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the Willis family stopped causing trouble for Verena, she had kept her distance-neither lending support nor showing hostility-perhaps as a token of respect for the late Shawna. Their life had finally returned to its usual peaceful rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. and Mrs. Willis, Verena has arrived!&#34; Kylee burst into the living room, panting but smiling broadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words struck like thunder. Alec&#39;s hand shook, and the porcelain coffee cup slipped, shattering with a sharp crack. Dark liquid splashed his trousers, yet he didn&#39;t so much as flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widened, his face torn between disbelief and joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura, too, froze mid-motion, the scarf still in her grasp, her smile caught halfway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three seconds passed. Then, as if a curtain had lifted, their expressions bloomed with delight. In unison,they exclaimed, &#34;What did you say? Verena is here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Kylee could answer, a clear, composed voice drifted from the doorway:&#34;Why? Am I not welcome here?&#34;A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec and Laura turned at once, stunned, their eyes locking on the figure at the entrance.</p>
