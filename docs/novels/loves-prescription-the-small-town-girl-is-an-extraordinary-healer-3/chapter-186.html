                <p>Before Isaac had lost his memories about her, roses were always his choice for her, a bouquet in hand every time they met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After his memory loss, she had only mentioned once that they were her favorite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her surprise, he had kept it in mind since then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking the bouquet, V/erena&#39;s eyes lit up with genuine warmth. &#34;Thank you, both of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her happiness eased Isaac&#39;s heart, though a quiet weight still pressed against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an effort to sound casual, he asked, &#34;That man we saw leaving with you earlier-was he a friend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question made Verena pause, but only briefly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly smiled. &#34;Yes. Someone I&#39;ve known a long time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s voice stayed even. &#34;Why not introduce him to us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He and I just ran into each other on the plane,&#34; she  explained lightly. &#34;He already had business to take care of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Believing Isaac might want to know the people around her better, she leaned closer so their eyes met. With a gentle firmness, she added, &#34;When the time&#39;s right, I&#39;ll introduce you two, alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her easy honesty unsettled him more than he expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking away, Isaac remarked, &#34;Fine. Let&#39;s just get to the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smart as ever, Bobby slipped into the passenger seat without fuss, leaving Verena and Isaac in the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost immediately, he turned around, grinning.&#34;Verena, you really surprised me this time. I always knew you were capable, but I never imagined you were that capable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chatter didn&#39;t stop once the car pulled away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena laughed softly. &#34;Don&#39;t exaggerate. There are plenty of people far more accomplished than l am.&#34; &lt;</p>
