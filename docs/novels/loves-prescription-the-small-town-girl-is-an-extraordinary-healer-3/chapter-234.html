                <p>After tossing the bank card back at Luis, Verena pulled out of the driveway, steering straight toward the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she reached the underground garage,her mind was already shifting into work mode.She parked quickly, rode the elevator to the lobby, and the sharp,sterilescent of disinfectant reminded her exactly where she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed open the door to her private lounge,but before she could even take her bag off her shoulder,it burst open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, she turned, only to see Julianna rush in with panic etched across her face. &#34;Evelyn,we just brought in a patient. The condition is critical, and only you can take the case,&#34; she said in a rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of those words wiped every trace of calm from Verena&#39;s features. She pivoted on her heel and strode quickly toward the operating room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julianna stayed close, speaking rapidly as they walked.She filled Verena in on the patient&#39;s failing condition,her voice tense but steady. In the preparation area, Verena slipped into her sterile gown and gloves. She looked at the nurse beside her.&#34;Is the anesthetic already given?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, everything&#39;s ready,&#34; said the nurse with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Verena shot a glance back at Julianna.&#34;We&#39;re going in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julianna, already suited up, returned the nod and followed her inside. The moment they entered, the room tightened with silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only sounds came from the rhythmic beeping of the equipment and the faint rustle of sterile fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes locked on the screen showing the patient&#39;s vitals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scalpel pressed into her palm as soon as the nurse passed it over, and Verena shut out everything except the task at hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each second dragged like an hour, her knitted brows refusing to ease, a clear sign of the struggle before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time slipped into hours, and sweat began to sting her eyes. Still, she never faltered. Her hands moved with sharp accuracy, every cut and stitch a desperate bid to keep the patient alive. She knew there was no margin for error. One slip could mean death right there on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the sweat threatened to fall, a nurse stepped in quickly, blotting it away so Verena&#39;s concentration never wavered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room held its breath, silence thick enough to feel,broken only by the faint sounds of monitors and instruments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, after four relentless hours, Verena lowered her hands. The battle was finished, and the surgery was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena finally stepped out of the operating room,her shoulders sagging from exhaustion. Julianna quickly passed her a bottle of water and spoke with relief.&#34;The patient pulled through. He&#39;s already been moved into observation. Evelyn, let me handle things from here. You should get some rest in the lounge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lifted the bottle to her lips, easing her dry throat before asking, &#34;And what about you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julianna shook her head lightly. &#34;You were the one leading the whole operation. I&#39;m fine. I can nap on this chair if I need to, and the nurses are right here to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Verena lingered, torn by the thought of leaving when the patient&#39;s state was still so fragile. Catching that hesitation, Julianna tapped her own belly and gave a gentle smile. &#34;You need to thinkof the baby too. Go on,take a break.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile touched Verena&#39;s face as she rested a hand on her stomach. &#34;Alright then. I&#39;ll go rest. Let me know the second anything happens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in her lounge, she sank into the chair,hoping for even a short nap. The chance never came. A knock sounded before her body could fully relax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, come in,&#34; Verena called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse edged the door open and spoke in a hushed tone. &#34;Evelyn, someone tried reaching you several times while you were in surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded once. &#34;Alright. Thank you. Go on back to your duties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the nurse left, she pulled open the drawer and took out her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen showed a string of missed calls from Ivan.Without hesitation, she tapped his number and returned the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She assumed it had to do with the psychologist he had promised to help her contact. The line connected almost instantly, and his voice came sharp with irritation. &#34;Verena, where have you been? Why didn&#39;t you pick up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena pressed her lips together, her voice quiet when she finally answered, &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I was in the middle of surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I see.&#34; Ivan&#39;s voice shifted the moment he realized she had been working. &#34;So that&#39;s why you missed my calls. I&#39;ll keep this quick so you can rest.I managed to get in touch with Luther,the psychologist for your husband. We spoke a few days back,and he rang me today to confirm. Unless something delays him, he&#39;s leaving Clokron tonight and heading straight for Shoildon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Verena&#39;s weariness lifted as if it had never been there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope flickered through her chest, bright and unstoppable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther&#39;s reputation preceded him, and she had long believed that someone of his caliber might be the key to Isaac&#39;s recovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relieved,she eased into her chair, her lips curving with genuine gratitude. &#34;That&#39;s wonderful, Ivan. I can&#39;t thank you enough.&#34; He gave a soft click of his tongue. &#34;Come on now,we&#39;re like family. You don&#39;t need to thank me. Just promise me you&#39;ll rest. An operation like that usually takes two or three hours, and you&#39;ve pushed yourself too hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call ended, she powered off her phone and leaned back, prepared to let her body finally relax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her peace lasted only moments. The door burst open,and Julianna hurried inside, her face pale with panic.&#34;Evelyn, something&#39;s gone wrong. The patient&#39;s heart just stopped. You have to come now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena shot to her feet and rushed toward the resuscitation room without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The battle began all over again the instant she stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything slowed-the room hushed, save for the frantic breaths and the hurried movements of her hands as she fought for the patient&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearly an hour passed before the crisis eased, and the heartbeat on the monitor steadied once more.</p>
