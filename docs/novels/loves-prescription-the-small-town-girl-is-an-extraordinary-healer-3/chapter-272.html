                <p>Isaac steadied the delicate bowl in his hand, rolling his wheelchair closer to the bedside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena caught sight of him and instinctively pursed her lips. Her voice carried both fatigue and resignation as she murmured, &#34;Isaac, I&#39;m really not in the mood to eat anything right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac halted beside her, his smile warm yet coaxing.&#34;I understand. I only heated some soup to ease your stomach. It usually brings comfort when one feels unwell. If y/our appetite returns, you can tell me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Verena blinked and allowed a faint smile to surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac carefully scooped up a spoonful of steaming soup, cooling it with a soft breath before bringing it gently to her lips. &#34;Just a taste-it&#39;s light, not heavy.&#34; She parted her lips, letting the warm broth slip past.It was like a quiet balm, soothing her throat and settling inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost at once, a wave of warmth spread from her stomach, easing much of the torment of morning sickness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the bowl was emptied. Isaac fed her the last sip, and then set the vessel quietly on the bedside table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back to her, his gaze grew solemn. &#34;Verena,there&#39;s something I must tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her eyes, noticed the gravity etched in his expression, and chose silence-waiting instead for his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac paused, and then spoke with measured weight.&#34;From the moment I began to suspect Simon, I never once stopped digging. I launched investigation after investigation, sparing no effort. And at last, I learned the truth: the Simon before us is nothing but an imitation. The real Simon died long ago.&#34; As though reliving each step of the inquiry, Isaac furrowed his brow. &#34;In that clinic where Simon died,we uncovered a suspicious man named Carl Aguilar-someone who had grown up in the same village as Simon. They even shared a ward for a while. NJot long after Simon&#39;s death, Carl vanished. The more l considered it, the more the pieces pointed to him. So I had Stevie examine every record from the cosmetic surgery hospitals in Clokron. That&#39;s where we struck gold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze locked on Verena&#39;s as he spoke slowly.&#34;Carl underwent surgery-an entire transformation,head to toe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Verena&#39;s brows drew tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though her heart already suspected the truth-that Simon was Carl-the cold evidence still pierced her with sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the very man she had once saved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hatred flickered in her eyes as she muttered, &#34;So it really is Carl. Disguising himself as Simon...  approaching me on purpose...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac reached for her hand, his touch tender, yet his eyes probing. &#34;Verena, do you remember him well?Our search showed he once received treatment at your hospital in Clokron, but the security around your patients&#39; records were impenetrable. No matter how hard we tried, the trail ended there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gathered herself, giving &#39;a slight nod.&#34;I remember him, but only faintly. My impression of him was shallow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a small smile andadded, &#34;At that time, we hired Ivan for security. He sealed the information tightly. He&#39;s the best at what he does, so it&#39;s no wonder you found nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes narrowed faintly, their brightness dimming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mention of Ivan struck him like a hidden thorn.A pang of jealousy pricked at his heart, leaving a quiet sting. He pressed his lips together, and then murmured softly, &#34;He has feelings for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was gentle, yet it carried an undertone heavy as lead-like a feather that seemed light but bore hidden weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena failed to notice the subtle shift in him,assuming he referred to Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flashed with disdain, and her voice chilled.&#34;I guess as much. To be admired by someone like him is nothing short of an insult.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Images of Carl&#39;s vile deeds surged in her mind. Each memory of his cruelty toward those she loved made her sick with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac kept his silence, watching her carefully.From her words, he realized she spoke of Carl, not lvan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet sigh escaped him. Relief brushed his heart,yet the hidden bitterness lingered, pressed down like a secret burden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, and Isaac,&#34; Verena said suddenly,tightening her hold on his hand. &#34;There&#39;s something I need to tell you too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her in mild surprise. Verena paused, and then continued, &#34;Luis agreed to work with us. I also suspect Carl might be the one who killed my grandma. Once the truth is laid bare, I won&#39;t let him go unpunished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And there was the matter of harming lsaac-Carl would pay for that as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lifted his hand, brushing her cheek with deep tenderness. His voice, low and unwavering, carried a vow. &#34;Verena, no matter what comes, I&#39;ll face it with you. Anyone who has wounded you, anyone who&#39;s brought you sorrow-I&#39;ll see they answer for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had asked Ivan to restore the surveillance of Isaac&#39;s car accident. Last time, he&#39;d been too sure of himself and failed, leaving him stung with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, day and night blurred together as he sat rooted before the computer, unyielding as stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the computer room, Ivan&#39;s eyes never strayed from the screen. His fingers hammered the keys,shutting out the world beyond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Empty instant noodle cups rose in heaps, coffee mugs lay scattered, his hair was a mess, and his eyes bloodshot-but he pressed on without care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Failure came again and again, yet he refused to surrender. After countless tries, success finally shone through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the recovered footage appeared, Ivan threw his hands skyward and shouted with triumph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rest and sleep were strangers to him in the past few days; he hadn&#39;t even spared a glance at whether day or night lay beyond the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without delay, he seized his phone and dialed Verena&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Seraphina Villas... Late-night silence cloaked the villa, the world hushed under the veil of sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moonlight, pale as silver, streamed through the gauzy curtains, scattering shifting patterns across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nestled quietly against lsaac&#39;s arm, their breaths soft, bodies closely entwined, both adrift in dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But peace proved fragile. A faint vibration fromn the bedside table broke the stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disturbed, Verena stirred. Her lashes fluttered open as wakefulness crept back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out, groping for the vibrating phone, its glow harsh against the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows knitted slightly, but when she saw lvan&#39;s name flashing on the screen, the haze of sleep vanished in an instant.</p>
