                <p>The interview was live-streamed, letting the audience follow every word and gesture in real time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the interview hall, a black sedan rested by the roadside, its polished surface glinting like a mirror beneath the sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Isaac sat quietly in the back seat. Sunlight spilled through the window, tracing the outline of his tall figure. His long eyelashes left a faint shadow under his eyes, and the sharp lines of his profile carried a calm strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From this angle, he seemed almost gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze never left his phone, as though the world outside had ceased to exist. His expression was steady, yet his focus betrayed the gravity of what he was watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the screen, Verena appeared under the blaze of lights, surrounded by cameras.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confidence and grace poured from her as naturally as breath. With her chin lifted ever so slightly, her eyes held a quiet fire, both resolute and serene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each question from the reporters met with her crisp,eloquent replies-words rich with wit and poise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac realized how mistaken he had been to think she had once drawn near for the Bennett family&#39;s wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, she was already exceptional, her reputation and networks abroad far beyond what most could dream of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So from the beginning, perhaps she had cared for him, even if just a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her radiance on stage, lsaac felt his heartbeat quicken, awe and admiration rising like a tide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every smile, every graceful motion of hers rippled through him like a pebble dropped into still waters,stirring emotions he could no longer contain. Verena-she was his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time in the car stretched on. In the driver&#39;s seat,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob twisted his neck, easing the stiffness in his muscles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his eyes drifted to the rearview mirror, he froze, mouth falling open in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reflection showed lsaac-usually stern,composed-smiling openly, his white teeth bright against a faint blush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked, for once, not like the distant CEO of Bennett Group, but like a youth hopelessly smitten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier that morning, after dropping Verena at the interview venue, Isaac had pulled out his phone,waiting patiently for the live broadcast to begin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Isaac had connected his Bluetooth earphones, Jacob was certain his boss was tuned in to Verena&#39;s interview.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such a lovesick sight was rare, so Jacob couldn&#39;t resist a tease. &#34;Mr. Bennett, are you not going to rein it in a little? Your smile is nearly reaching your ears.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lifted his eyelids slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; His tone was calm, yet the smile not only lingered but widened, his gaze softening into something openly adoring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob wondered if all men in love lost themselves like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jacob.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled by the sudden call of his name, Jacob straightened, expecting some command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he met Isaac&#39;s eyes, his boss tilted his chin with quiet pride and asked, &#34;Do you know Evelyn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For·a moment Jacob was dumbstruck. Since when had Isaac learned to show off? Truly, love reshaped a man in ways both startling and strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept such thoughts to himself, though his hesitant look betrayed him. &#34;Uh... Mr. Bennett, of course | know. The news about your wife being Evelyn has been everywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Isaac flipped his phone around, showing the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice brimmed with unconcealed delight.′′My wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob blinked, caught completely off guard. On the screen, Verena&#39;s poised figure commanded the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Jacob realize-his boss wasn&#39;t asking for information; he was flaunting his happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no choice, Jacob bobbed his head vigorously. &#34;Yes, yes, Mr. Bennett, your wife is truly remarkable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s smile deepened.&#34;I think so too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he turned his attention back to the broadcast,content.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearly twenty minutes later, the interview concluded.Jacob slipped out of the car first, opening the door in readiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena stepped out of the building, she greeted him with a warm smile before getting in. &#34;Thank you,and sorry for keeping you waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob quickly shook his head. &#34;Not at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inwardly, he muttered that the waiting itself hadn&#39;t been difficult-what had been difficult was enduring Isaac&#39;s endless display of affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier that morning, Verena had already shared her schedule with Isaac. Now, once Jacob had shut the door, he returned to the driver&#39;s seat and steered them toward the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, Isaac reached for a bottle of mineral water he had kept ready. His long fingers twisted the cap with ease before handing it over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Verena murmured, taking a sip to ease her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just minutes ago, he could only glimpse her through a screen. Now she sat beside him, close enough to ervous touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world seemed to still. His pulse surged as he breathed in her faint fragrance, her presence filling every corner of his senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes clung to her, brimming with devotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I watched the live broadcast,&#34; he said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After drinking, Verena handed back the bottle. Isaac capped it again and set it aside, their movements so natural they needed no words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you think I did?&#34; she asked, her smile both playful and searching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac tilted his head slightly, his eyes a pool of tenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In my eyes, you&#39;re the best-beyond compare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really admire me that much?&#34; Verena teased with feigned surprise. &#34;Then I must work even harder to live up to your trust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sunlight danced in her clear eyes, and her lips  glistened faintly as she spoke. Isaac swallowed hard, forcing his gaze to the window to resist the urge to kiss her-after all, they weren&#39;t alone in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, they arrived at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena guided Isaac into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, the corridors were quiet today, and after registration, only twenty minutes passed before it was her turn to draw blood and check her HCG levels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the door of the examination room, Isaac took her hand and pressed a tender kiss upon it, whispering,&#34;Don&#39;t worry. No matter the result, I&#39;ll stand by you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth in his eyes melted into hers, filling her heart wvith comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost unconsciously, Verena touched her abdomen with her free hand, as though feeling for the life that might already be stirring there. She smiled gently. &#34;I&#39;m going in now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she disappeared into the room, Jacob approached Isaac. &#34;Mr. Bennett, let me take you to the waiting lounge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the examination was done, Verena returned and sat beside Isaac. Immediately, he clasped her hand, their fingers intertwining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did the doctor say?&#34; he asked, his face tense with both hope and unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave a soft smile. &#34;The results will take two hours...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did lsaac realize how worked up he had been, forgetting the wait required.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his anxiety, Verena looked at him with gentle eyes and asked softly, &#34;Are you nervous?&#34;</p>
