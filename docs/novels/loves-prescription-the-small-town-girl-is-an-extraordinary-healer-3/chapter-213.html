                <p>&#34;Moreover.&#34; Verena lowered her head again, her gaze fastening on the résumé before her. She went on,&#34;According to your file, your family should be living in Clokron. Tell me-why choose to part ways with your family and step away from such a promising position, only to apply for work here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes never left the papers in her hand, blind to the steady gaze Simon had fixed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the desk, Simon&#39;s eyes clung to her every movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head was slightly bowed, sunlight spilling through the window and wrapping her in a warm halo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The angle revealed her slender neck, smooth and delicate, almost inviting a touch. The soft light painted her earlobes with a gentle pink glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange warmth stirred in Simon&#39;s chest, the seed of obsession quietly blooming. For a heartbeat, he longed to pull her into his very being, as though nothing else would ever be enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet when Verena lifted her head, the fleeting madness vanished from his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon straightened with practiced ease, pushing his glasses up with a calm, natural gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried a quiet modesty as he replied, &#34;First, thank you for your praise. As for why I chose this hospital-the reason is straightforward. Its reputation is second to none. Around the wold, it stands as a place most medical graduates could only dream of joining. I, too, have long hoped for such a chance. But...&#34;He paused, looking directly at Verena. &#34;There&#39;s another reason that matters even more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>5Verena tilted her head ever so slightly, waiting for him to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her puzzled gaze met his. Simon&#39;s lips curved faintly, though his eyes remained steady and solemn.&#34;You are held in the highest regard throughout the medical field. I have admired your accomplishments for years.Your skills are unquestionable, and I hope to learn under you-to refine myself, and ultimately serve more patients.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lowered her gaze slowly, his words stirring her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The calm confidence in his tone revealed a man who could weather storms without faltering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And indeed, his reasons were not unfounded; many doctors had joined because of her reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers tapped lightly against the table, producing a faint rhythm as her mind wandered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s eyes drifted to her hand, noting the elegance of her slender fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The white blouse she wore, with its flowing sleeves, revealed the smooth line of her wrist when she moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The loose cuffs fell back just enough for his eyes to travel further, catching a fleeting glimpse of her skin-soft, smooth, almost dangerously tempting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered, heavy with unspoken desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, time seemed to pause; the quiet room held only her gentle presence and his growing obsession. A sudden wave of possessiveness surged through him, tightening his jaw and stiffening the muscles beneath his sleeves as he fought the urge to reach for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a weighted silence, Verena broke it with a composed voice. &#34;Mr. Moss, your extensive experience and the many medical awards you&#39;ve earned speak for themselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rose to her feet, extending her hand with a smile. &#34;Mr. Moss, you fully meet our hospital&#39;s recruitment criteria. Welcome aboard. I looktforward to seeing what you can contribute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s eyes fell on her delicate hand, a flicker of madness flashing like lightning across his calm expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet it had gone unnoticed by Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood slowly and reached for her hand, touching it lightly-an elegant brush more than a shake. Outwardly, he was the very picture of a gentleman, poised and dignified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet beneath that facade raged a storm of restless desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted the corners of his mouth, offering a warm, assuring smile. &#34;Rest easy. I will prove myself with action, and I will not fail your expectations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded, her eyes soft with approval. &#34;I look forward to your performance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She withdrew first, letting his hand fall away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But beneath the table, Simon&#39;s fingers brushed against his palm, almost caressing the warmth she had left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That brief contact burned into him, refusing to fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenched his hand tightly, as though to trap the sensation before it slipped away. His longing deepened,sharp as iron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to have her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever it cost, he would have her.	 After the interview, Verena rêturned to Isaac&#39;s VIP ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She entered just as Julianna finished examining him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena asked softly, &#34;How&#39;s his recovery today?&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Handing her the record booklet, Julianna smiled. &#34;Thanks to your care-and your husband&#39;s good health to begin with-his recovery looks very promising.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone buzzed several times from her coat pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning off the alarm, she said, &#34;Evelyn, I have an operation scheduled. I&#39;ll need to go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena pressed her lips together and nodded. &#34;Alright, go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julianna left quietly, her steps light and swift. Verena lowered her gaze, scanning the records carefully. Soon, her expression brightened with relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning toward Isaac, lying in bed, she said with joy, &#34;Isaac, your wounds are healing beautifully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set the booklet aside, moving closer. &#34;If all goes well, you&#39;ll be ready for rehabilitation training in a week.Are you excited?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac still found their recent days difficult to believe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The happiness before him felt like a fragile dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows drew together, uncertainty flickering in his voice though hope glimmered underneath. &#34;Verena,can I really make it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could he truly walk again, live again as any other man?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena tilted her head, her lips lifting into a quiet smile as she guided his hand to her abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. I believe in you. And so does our baby. We both trust you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac froze, stunned by the unwavering faith in her eyes. In that moment, the shadows of doubt scattered,replaced by a resolve he hadn&#39;t known he still carried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A week flew by like a passing cloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had crutches ready, her voice soft with encouragement.&#34;Isaac, today we begin your training. Don&#39;t be nervous. I believe you can do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though a trace of unease lingered in his eyes, Isaac nodded firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his determination, Verena supported him carefully as he stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly,Isaac lowered his feet to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as hope began to stir, his legs gave way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He collapsed to his knees with a harsh thud, the sound echoing through the quiet room like glass shattering</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena caught him in alarm, her brows knitting tightly. &#34;What&#39;s happening? Why would this happen now?&#34; She had watched his recovery day after day; this should have been the best stage for progress. How could she have been wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac kept his head lowered, staring at his powerless legs. A crushing wave of defeat and frustration washed over him, draining his spirit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he looked up and met Verena&#39;s anxious eyes, he forced a gentle smile. &#34;I was prepared for this from the start. Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t give up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though calm on the surface, his voice trembled faintly, betraying the storm within.</p>
