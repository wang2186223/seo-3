                <p>Before Isaac could react, Verena lifted her head in one swift motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile shone brightly, like sunlight breaking through a spring morning haze</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her head tilted slightly, her eyes curved with delight as she said, &#34;&#39;It&#39;s good that you think this way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words came like a feather&#39;s touch, light and teasing, as she leaned in once again, brushing a kiss across the corner of Isaac&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tide of emotion crashed through Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kissed him like she had done that many times,every gesture unforced, every glance assured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart seemed to falter for a beat, while a faint fragrance clung to the air between them, leaving his mind stripped bare, unable to muster a single thought in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lashes quivered, his gaze fixed yet vacant, staring at the woman before him as if spellbound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his daze, Verena&#39;s lips curved higher.Dissatisfied with his stillness, she leaned closer once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he could see now was her face magnified in his vision-those fluttering lashes, the delicate arc of her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand intertwined with his, and her lips found his again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was her third kiss of the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she simply exercising the privileges of being his future wife?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or could it be... she truly cared for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Isaac entertained both thoughts, the latter rang louder in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once planted, the idea grew like ivy, winding deeper into his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His throat tightened; he swallowed hard, no longer holding back the frantic rhythm of his heart as he slowly closed his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as he surrendered, her lips left his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she saw him close his eyes, Verena&#39;s smile deepened. She leaned near his ear, her voice low and playful. &#34;You seem to be enjoying it, don&#39;t you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was deliberately laced with allure, threaded with a hint of mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac snapped back to his senses, eyes flying open,only to find her face inches away,her cheek nearly brushing his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting her gaze, he felt his heart skip, and then darted his eyes aside, clearing his throat instead of answering her teasing words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when he noticed his hand was still laced with hers, fingers locked together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers were defined, smooth, and slender, yet they still seemed plain against hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand, soft and delicate, wvith slender proportions and faint pink joints, reminded him of fine porcelain,flawless and fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena,unaware of the thoughts lingering in his silence, tilted her head, forcing him to meet her eyes once more. Her lips curved as she teased, &#34;Why aren&#39;t you answering me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to retreat any further, Isaac&#39;s ears flushed red,his Adam&#39;s apple bobbing nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34; His husky voice had barely formed when his phone vibrated from his suit pocket, cutting him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their gazes locked; Isaac looked at Verena with a question in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amused by his expression, Verena released his hand,rose to her feet, and nodded. &#34;Go ahead, answer it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac clenched his slightly damp palm, pulled out his phone with his other hand, and accepted the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice on the other end spoke first. &#34;Hello, Mr.Bennett. I&#39;m calling from Weaving Love Bridal Shop.The photos you and Mrs. Bennett took are ready.When would you like to come in with your wifeto select them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it the bridal shop?&#34; The room was quiet enough for Verena to overhear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac nodded, tilting the phone slightly aside. &#34;They&#39;re asking when we want to choose the photos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you busy this afternoon?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac hesitated briefly, already sensing what she was leading toward. Then he shook his head. &#34;Only minor tasks-I can leave them to my assistant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved. &#34;Since neither of us is occupied, let&#39;s go today.&#34; With a slight smile, lsaac gave a short grunt of agreement before telling the staff member, &#34;We&#39;ll be there shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly delegated his tasks to his assistant,leaving the driver to take the assistant back to the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so, Isaac rode in Verena&#39;s car to the bridal shop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they arrived, the staff greeted them warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same young sales assistant who had initially been dismissive toward Verena last time now hurried forward, offering her a glass of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Verena remembered the slight, she let it pass,accepting the glass casually and taking a sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her calm demeanor, the sales assistant exhaled in relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena and Isaac settled onto the sofa, reviewing the photos displayed on the computer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff member handled the mouse with care,pausing at each image for their input.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They viewed several shots, most showing lsaac&#39;s solemn face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Bennett, what do you think of this one?&#34; the staff member asked respectfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena studied the photo, unimpressed. &#34;Next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff member scrolled down</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She furrowed her brows slightly, raising her chin.&#34;Next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had selected three earlier, but nothing had pleased them since.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though both were strikingly attractive, Isaac&#39;s expression remained stiff in most shots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After nearly a dozen more images, Verena&#39;s eyes lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the displayed photo, her arms were looped around Isaac&#39;s neck, her body angled on his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her face upward, while he leaned down,their lips touching lightly, noses nearly brushing-an intimate scene frozen in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff member, waiting for judgment, held the mouse still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After gazing for a long moment, Verena&#39;s lips curved as she pointed, telling the staff member, &#34;This one&#39;s my favorite. Make it large and frame it; I&#39;ll hang it in our bedroom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words sent Isaac&#39;s heart into a stutter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photo had captured the exact moment she kissed him spontaneously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t expected it to turn out so vivid, so genuine -like a portrait of love itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what surprised him most: Verena had claimed it as her favorite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind replayed the sensation of her kiss that day,heat rising to his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,she liked such closeness,did she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His shyness ebbed as he looked more closely, noticing a detail missed before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t been sitting fully on his lap-a slight ggap remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since his legs couldn&#39;t feel anything, he had thought she had truly sat upon him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But clearly,she hadn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory surfaced: after the photo was taken,Verena had risen with an awkward stretch of her legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Isaac realize-she must have been balancing on her toes for too long, until her feet went numb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quietly, without a word, she had spared him discomfort. In the smallest of details he had overlooked,she had been thoughtful of his condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart stirred again, beating wildly as if it had slipped its cage, unable to settle back where it belonged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he drifted in these thoughts, two photos had already flickered past on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Verena seemed to recall something, turning her face toward him. &#34;Oh, I forgot to ask your opinion.What do you think of this photo?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had never been close with other women,though in his world of fame and fortune, many had approached him. Whether their gestures had been intentional or casual, he had always seen through them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,looking at Verena-her innocent eyes meeting his with unguarded sincerity-an unfamiliar tide rose in his chest, carrying unspoken thoughts he could neither voice nor contain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Verena thought he might retreat into silence or deflect with indifference,. Isaac smiled softly.&#34;You&#39;re my future wife, Verena; you decide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried justenough weight to reach the ears of those nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several female staff covered their mouths, whispering with envy. &#34;Oh my, he&#39;s so gentle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena froze,momentarily stunned. Warmth rushed to her cheeks, pulling her back to reality</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her gaze lingered in Isaac&#39;s bright eyes, she quickly pressed her lips together and turned back toward the computer, leaving him only her profile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes flickered with a newfound realization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze rested on the faint blush coloring her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So-she could be shy as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the sun had lowered its light, the selection of wedding photos was complete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s assistant was already waiting at the entrance of the bridal shop. When everything was wrapped up,Verena and Isaac each departed in their own cars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some days later, Verena sat reviewing her freshly completed manuscript for a medical book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stretching her limbs, she felt her phone buzz across the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen lit up with a name: &#34;Gavin Reid.&#34; Gavin was one of her assistants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike Julianna, he was still a medical student, and his family carried notable influence in Shoildon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, he had been sent by his father to study under her guidance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet despite those circumstances, Gavin and Verena shared a natural ease in working together.</p>
