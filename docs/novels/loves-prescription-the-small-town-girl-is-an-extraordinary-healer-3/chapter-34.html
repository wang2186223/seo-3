                <p>Laura gave a small nod before saying, &#34;Alright, get some rest. We&#39;ll catch up tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the sound of footsteps vanished down the hall,Kaia flung the pearl necklace to the side without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Kaia returned home earlier, Laura had noticed something was weighing on her and asked if the evening had gone poorly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of explaining, Kaia had shaken her head,claimed she was tired, and quickly used that excuse to head upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was different. Kaia wasn&#39;t tired at all, but she couldn&#39;t figure out why Verena had appeared at the Lyons family residence. What baffled her even more was the sight of Verena inside Barrie&#39;s quarters. Barrie held status and influence, yet Verena, who had no place in that circle, dared to show up there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uneasy feeling pressed against Kaia&#39;s thoughts. She tried piecing it together, but no matter how long she turned it over in her mind, she found no answer. At last, she told herself she must have been imagining</p>
                
                
                
                <p>things. After all, someone like Verena couldn&#39;t possibly have ties to Barrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that idea to cling to, her nerves finally began to settle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia pulled out her phone, intending to check the wealthy young people&#39;s group chat, hoping to see if anything new had been shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the chat app loaded, she realized she had signed into her alternate account, where one unread message was waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since that account remained private, she instantly knew Bobby was the one who had sent it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tapped into their conversation and read his note about wanting to meet Verena, which curved her lips into a smirk. The sharpness in his words revealed just how little regard he had for Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought made Kaia laugh, though it still didn&#39;t satisfy her. What she really wanted was to see Bobby push with everything he had to put an end to Verena and Isaac&#39;s wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear to Kaia that Bobby&#39;s pride left no room for anyone trying to tell him what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes dropped to her phone as her fingers danced quickly across the screen. Once she reread the message for accuracy, she hit send without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Bobby&#39;s phone buzzed, he snatched it up, sat bolt upright in bed, and gawked at the screen in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words on his screen made him read them twice.&#34;You need to stop speaking to me with such disrespect. I&#39;ll be your brother&#39;s wife soon, and as Isaac&#39;s brother, the least you can do is show me courtesy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage surged through Bobby as he reread the message.He knew he had been sharp with her on purpose, and even if his tone wasn&#39;t polite, who gave her the right to call him out? She wasn&#39;t even married into the family yet, and she was already strutting around like she owned the place. If she behaved like this now,what kind of arrogance would she show once she officially joined the Bennett family?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thumbs flew across the screen as he responded,&#34;You&#39;re not Isaac&#39;s wife yet. I&#39;ll speak to you however I damn well please, and it&#39;s not your concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Kaia saw his response, a slow, satisfied smile curled across her lips. Bobby was already losing patience, and that was exactly what she wanted. If she kept pressing, his resentment toward Verena would deepen, and he&#39;d soon be desperate to block the marriage altogether.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned back and began typing again. &#34;Do you think I enjoy wasting my time on you? If you weren&#39;t Isaac&#39;s brother, I wouldn&#39;t bother at all. Once I marry him, I&#39;ll be part of the Bennett family, which makes it my responsibility to correct you. If I don&#39;t straighten you out now, people will say members of our Bennett family have no manners. That shame won&#39;t just fall on you-it will stain all of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message sent Bobby into a fury. She was already tossing around phrases like &#34;our Bennett family,&#34; as though she had a claim to it. She hadn&#39;t even joined the family yet, and still she dared to posture like a rightful Bennett.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fingers pounding against the screen, Bobby snapped,&#34;Listen carefully. Don&#39;t try to play teacher with me.Unless I decide otherwise, you&#39;ll never be my sister-in -law, not now, not ever. And don&#39;t forget, the wedding hasn&#39;t even happened yet. You act like it&#39;s guaranteed, but if you fail to step into the Bennett family, don&#39;t come crying about it later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the message was sent, Bobby closed the app and flung his phone carelessly onto the nightstand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each time Bobby thought about Verena beside Dr.Willis, it only made him more determined to steer Isaac toward marrying the doctor. After just a handful of conversations with that cold and cunning woman, he caught himself wanting to march over and ask Dr.Willis to marry lsaac on the spot. A woman like her,kind, elegant, and lovely, was exactly what lsaac needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It drove him crazy wondering how two people sharing the same last name could be so completely opposite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence filled the room as Bobby&#39;s fist crashed against the mattress. Forget Verena-what mattered nowN was finding a way to bring lsaac and Dr. Willis together. He had no doubt that once they met, lsaac would be captivated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, Bobby understood his brother well enough to know that a direct suggestion would be rejected outright. But if he disguised it as a medical consultation, Isaac might agree without resistance.That way, his condition could be treated while their bond quietly deepened-a flawless plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image of Isaac healthy again and standing beside Dr. Willis played vividly in Bobby&#39;s mind, fueling his resolve like fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jumping to his feet, Bobby shoved on his shoes and strode quickly out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Kaia studied Bobby&#39;s latest message,her eyes sparkling with satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sharp response confirmed he was seething, and Verena&#39;s reputation in his eyes was beyond repair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought brought a smug smile to Kaia&#39;s lips as she hummed a light tune on her way to the bathroom to wash off her makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as Bobby blocked the marriage, her lie would remain safe, because Verena would never get the chance to cross paths with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the Bennett Mansion, Bobby made his way down the hall until he reached Isaac&#39;s door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering how badly Isaac had snapped at him the last time he barged in, Bobby decided to knock politely this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s voice called out, &#34;Come in.&#34; Bobby placed his hand on the knob, pushed the door open, and stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There he found Isaac propped against the headboard,a thick book resting in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a forced laugh, Bobby strolled closer and teased,&#34;So,buried in a book again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting the book down on the blanket, Isaac lifted his eyes and said, &#34;Alright, what do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging a chair from the desk, Bobby sat near the bed and grinned. &#34;What else could it be?I just felt like  talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most people might have believed him, but lsaac knew better. Bobby never came by at this hour unless something was on his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After lifting the book again, Isaac resumed reading and said,&#34;If you don&#39;t have a point, then get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snatching the book from lsaac&#39;s hands, Bobby blurted out, &#34;Okay, okay-I&#39;lL say it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac kept his calm, watching Bobby in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting Isaac&#39;s steady gaze, Bobby&#39;s mouth tightened as he hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he wanted was to rant about Verena&#39;s arrogance,but the memory of lsaac&#39;s harsh scolding last time made him switch tactics instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So here&#39;s the thing-I came across an incredible doctor recently.&#34; Bobby&#39;s eyes sparked with enthusiasm as he leaned forward. &#34;You wouldn&#39;t believe it. Every other doctor failed with Barrie&#39;s illness, but she actually managed to stabilize him!&#34;</p>
