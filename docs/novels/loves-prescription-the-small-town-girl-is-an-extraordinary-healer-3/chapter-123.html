            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>At the Bennett Mansion, Danica raised her brows in mild surprise when a servant announced Katelyn&#39;s visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bennett family had always maintained close ties with the Fuller family, and Danica had practically watched the lady grow up. She remembered clearly how boldly Katelyn had chased after lsaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That Katelyn had only just returned from overseas yet chosen to come here first spoke volumes-her thoughts were still firmly fixed on Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, Danica gave a small nod. &#34;Show her in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short while later, she watched as Katelyn swept into the living room with a dazzling smile, her hands carrying tastefully wrapped gift boxes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving the country, Katelyn had trailed Isaac constantly, like a shadow glued to his side. Now, on her return, lsaac had lost his ability to walk and was bound in marriage. Still, she appeared unchanged-radiant, sweet, and brimming with youthful charm that recalled those earlier days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight stirred something in Danica, a wistful ache.If not for that accident, perhaps Isaac and Katelyn might have truly ended up together. She had always admired Katelyn, but Isaac&#39;s heart had been as cold and distant as a mountain of ice, impossible for anyone to thaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Bennett! It&#39;s been far too long-I&#39;ve missed you dearly!&#34; Katelyn chimed brightly, slipping into Danica&#39;s arms with the ease of family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though years had passed, her warmth was genuine enough to soften Danica, who patted her gently on the back. &#34;Katelyn, you&#39;ve grown lovelier during your time abroad. Surely you have a trail of admirers chasing after you now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn pressed her hands to her cheeks with a shy laugh. &#34;Mrs. Bennett, I&#39;ve only just come back and you&#39;re already teasing me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She motioned toward the neatly stacked boxes on the table. &#34;I brought a few things for you-please take a look and see if they suit your taste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s eyes landed on one package, her brows lifting when she recognized the insignia of a rare luxury brand few could get their hands on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a light tap on Katelyn&#39;s shoulder, she said with a smile, &#34;Thank you, dear. You&#39;re too polite; your visit alone is more than enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn stuck her tongue out playfully. &#34;It&#39;s nothing,just a little token of my respect for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t her first time in the Bennett household.With practiced ease, she signaled a maid. &#34;Dorcie,would you mind taking these upstairs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorcie Wright bowed her head respectfully before carrying the gifts away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica then led Katelyn to the sofa, pouring a steaming cup of coffee before handing it over. &#34;So tell me, how long will you be staying in the country this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Accepting the cup with a sweet smile, Katelyn shook her head, her expression tinged with hesitation. &#34;To be honest, I don&#39;t know yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s brows drew together. &#34;What do you mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing the cup back on the table, Katelyn met her gaze squarely, her tone earnest. &#34;Mrs. Bennett, I&#39;ll be frank. The reason I returned...is because of Isaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica stilled, surprise flickering across her features.She hadn&#39;t expected Katelyn&#39;s feelings to remain this strong-chasing after lsaac abroad, and even now,with his disability, refusing to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reading her thoughts, Katelyn softened her smile.&#34;Please don&#39;t misunderstand. When I say it&#39;s for Isaac, I mean I&#39;ve come to treat him. Isaac and I grew up together. No matter what&#39;s happened, I can&#39;t turn my back on him.&#34; Danica exhaled softly, her shoulders easing as she asked, &#34;So you&#39;re saying you intend to treat lsaac?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right,&#34; Katelyn repled with a firm nod. &#34;You know I grew up surrounded by medicine, and l studied it seriously abroad. I&#39;ve dealt with cases similar to lsaac&#39;s and performed countless surgeries.I only came back once I was certain I had the confidence to succeed. Mrs. Bennett, believe me-l can heal him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the words lingered in Danica&#39;s mind, she recalled the morning&#39;s headlines that had rippled through high society. If what they said was true, if Katelyn&#39;s skill truly surpassed even that of the professors, then maybe... just maybe she could do what no one else had managed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea tugged at Danica, tempting as it was, until the image of Verena surfaced. She herself had gone to Verena not long ago, pleading for her help with Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Katelyn-Danica had not forgotten her relentless pursuit of Isaac in the past. Allowing her near him again could invite trouble, or worse,misunderstandings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hesitation did not escape Katelyn&#39;s sharp eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle tone, Katelyn asked, &#34;You&#39;re worried his wife won&#39;t accept it, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica gave a slow nod. Katelyn leaned closer, taking her hand with a reassuring smile. &#34;Mrs. Bennett,Isaac&#39;s health has to come before anything else. As for me, my feelings for him faded long ago-they&#39;re nothing but distant memories now. I know full well there can never be anything between us again.Please don&#39;t mistake my intentions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing Danica&#39;s softened stance, Katelyn continued gently, &#34;Even so, I&#39;ll always see him as one of my dearest friends. Watching him suffer like this,knowing I finally have the skill to help-how could just turn away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words settled into Danica&#39;s thoughts. If Katelyn truly possessed the ability to heal Isaac, then perhaps it would bring an extra layer of security. With a small sigh, Danica replied, &#34;Katelyn, this isn&#39;t a decision I can make on my own. I&#39;ll have to ask Isaac what he thinks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s smile bightened, sweet and warm. &#34;That&#39;s more than enough for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Katelyn&#39;s departure, Danica instructed the driver to head straight for the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside his office, lsaac was bent over a stack of contracts when a knock sounded at the door.Looking up, he asked, &#34;Mom? What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica crossed the room and lowered herself onto the sofa, her movements hesitant. Since the accident, moments alone with him had grown rare,and the words she wanted to say often died in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She filled the silence with small questions-if he was tired, what he&#39;d eaten for lunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac answered each one without complaint, but before she could continue, he cut in, &#34;Mom, I really need to get back to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing her throat, Danica forced the conversation forward. &#34;It&#39;s about Katelyn. She&#39;s just come back from abroad and visited me earlier. She claims to have experience with conditions like yours, and... I believe she might be capable. Would you consider letting her try to treat you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t hesitate once the words left her mouth.&#34;No. There&#39;s no need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica leaned forward, unwilling to back down so quickly. &#34;But if you tried a different doctor, it might open the door to another chance at recovery...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand slammed the documents flat against the desk with a sharp crack. His tone dropped, edged with ice. &#34;Verena is already treating me, and | trust her completely. Under her care, I&#39;ve been improving.I don&#39;t need anyone else, nor do I want anyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he didn&#39;t voice was the deeper truth-he wanted no connection to Katelyn, not now, not ever. The last thing he intended was to create friction with Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faced with his unyielding stance, Danica found her arguments slipping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few more words passed between them before she finally rose and left the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the car, she pulled out her phone and dialed Katelyn. &#34;Katelyn, I spoke with lsaac about the treatment.He refused.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice softened with concern, as though cushioning the blow. &#34;You know how he is. Once his mind is set, it&#39;s like moving a mountain. Don&#39;t let it discourage you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn, however, showed no sign of disappointment.Her lips curved into a confident smile as she answered, &#34;I expected as much, Mrs. Bennett. Thank you for speaking with him on my behalf.Please don&#39;t worry-I won&#39;t give up. I&#39;ll make lsaac accept my treatment sooner or later.&#34; Hearing the determination in Katelyn&#39;s voice,Danica could only end the call with a weary sigh, caught between two equally stubborn hearts.</p>
