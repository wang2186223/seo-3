                <p>During this period, Verena remained in the hospital, caring for lsaac with steadfast devotion, hoping that once his wounds closed, she could guide him into rehabilitation training.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the VIP ward, the sunlight slipped gently through the curtains, painting streaks of warmth across the cool-toned room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the hospital bed lay lsaac, sleeping soundly. His sharply defined brows softened in slumber, his long lashes casting delicate shadows beneath his eyes. Below his straight nose, his thin lips rested in a faint,restrained curve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hair, usually styled to precision, now fell in a natural disarray, lending him an air of ease and casual charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lingered at his bedside, watching quietly. After a while, she rose to fech the thermos on the table,carefully pouring it into a basin until faint wisps of steam spiraled upward like whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tested the water with her hand; once satisfied with the warmth, she soaked a towel, wrung it out, and gently heldIsaac&#39;s hand in hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Verena&#39;s hands were long and slim, they seemed delicate beside Isaac&#39;s, almost childlike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His palms were broad and firm, fingers strong and well-shaped, with joints that spoke of power. His hands could easily envelop hers whole, like the sea swallowing a stream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena was never one to admire hands, yet she had to concede-such hands were worth lingering over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching herself drifting, she gave a tiny shake of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed the warm towel gently against his hand, her touch tender and unhurried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the soft care through his dreams, Isaac gradually stirred. His vision blurred at first, then cleared,and before him was the familiar figure. Her hair cascaded down her shoulders, with a few strands catching the sunlight like threads of gold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were fixed on him, full of quiet care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight stirred his heart with a flood of mixed feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past months, he had never imagined that a woman would marry him while disregarding his frail condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Verena appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never thought his sexual potency could be restored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Verena appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had once believed the wheelchair would be his lifelong shackle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Verena appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had thought hope had deserted him for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she walked in, and light followed. Isaac watched her, captivated, until she lifted her gaze and saw that he was awake. She smiled softly.&#34;You&#39;re awake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set the towel aside and carefully helped. him sit upright against the headboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes brimmed with longing, but soon his brows knitted and a muffled groan escaped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After surgery, mishaps could spring up without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s heart tightened; she asked quickly, &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Do you feel pain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her anxious face, Isaac gave a faint smile: His tone carried mock grievance. &#34;It hurts...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Verena immediately leaned in to check, lifting the blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could, Isaac caught her wrist. She froze, confused-until she noticed the playful curve at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, she understood. He was teasing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her worry flared into irritation. &#34;Is i amusing to trick me?&#34; she scolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he replied with disarming calm. His voice was warm, and with a gentle pull, he drew her into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could argue further, he kissed her deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, nothing compared to this-her eyes full of him, her heart beating for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made him feel whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Greed even whispered to him: may he bury her first love in the shadows of the past, never to return,leaving only him in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kiss trembled with tenderness, sending shivers through them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena wrapped her arms around his neck, responding with a smile as shedeepened the embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their breaths quickened, echoing clearly in the silence of the room.	介</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, as if struck by déjà vu,a scene flashed in Isaac&#39;s mind-familiar, too familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hospital, a woman, a kiss...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman looked exactly like Verena, feeding him fruit as he lay in bed, and he-holding her hand and eagerly kissing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange unease coursed through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena noticed his pause and pulled back gently:&#34;Isaac, what&#39;s wrong?&#34; she asked softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac frowned, deep in thought. &#34;I feel that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the words faltered. The more he tried to recall, the hazier it became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flickers of images came and went-sometimes sharp, sometimes veiled-like looking through fogged glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head began to throb, needles of pain pricking sharper the harder he tried to recall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many people would feel that a situation had happened before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Isaac, this feeling of déjà vu had visited more than once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He forced himself to calm down. Perhaps he was simply overthinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting Verena to worry, he held her hand, shook his head gently, and said, &#34;Maybe I didn&#39;t rest well.I&#39;m fine, don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she knew he was hiding something, Verena also knew his body better than anyone after daily checks-nothing had shown amiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded softly. &#34;Alright, then rest a little longer. I&#39;ll be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>··· After Isaac drifted back to sleep, Verena slipped out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelyn!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to see Julianna hurrying over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julianna, what is it?&#34; Verena asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julianna reported with respect, &#34;Evelyn, the doctor interviews have been completed. We&#39;ve shortlisted several excellent candidates, and we await your final decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hospital&#39;s growth depended on a strong team, and so every step of the selection had to be weighed carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded. &#34;I see. Prepare the documents and notify them to come tomorrow morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;ll take care of it immediately,&#34; Julianna replied. The next morning, after sharing breakfast with Isaac, Verena made her way to the interview office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two hours passed. Each candidate displayed skill, experience, and composure-meeting the hospital&#39;s standards in every way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, the final candidate stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena instantly sensed something different about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the youngest of them all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His posture was upright, his features softened by a gentle face, gold-rimmed glasses perched on his high nose bridge. His amber eyes glimmered with quiet brightness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He carried himself with steady composure and kindness, leaving a favorable impression at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena smiled and gestured. &#34;Please, have a seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s lips curved faintly. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he sat, Verena glanced at his résumé and mentioned his name.&#34;Simon Moss.&#34;sound of it, Simon raised his brows ever so slightly, a subtle smile playing at his lips. &#34;That&#39;s me,&#34; he said warmly, nodding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The polite greeting gave way to the formal interview.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena fixed her gaze on him. &#34;From what I know, you are gifted and capable. More importantly, the hospital you served before ranks among the finest in Clokron, almost on par with Evelyn Model Hospital. Tell me-why choose to come here?&#34;</p>
