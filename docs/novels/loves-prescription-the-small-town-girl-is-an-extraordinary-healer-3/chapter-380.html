                <p>A long silencestretched before Luis finally settled back into his desk chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands found the surface, fingers interlacing as gravity settled over his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, Luis reached for the landline phone and placed the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His assistant&#39;s respectful voice filtered through the receiver almost immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening in his seat, Luis leaned toward the microphone with quiet authority. &#34;Notify the senior executives immediately. We&#39;re holding an emergency meeting in ten minutes. Everyone must be present on time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone clicked back into place as Luis sank deeper into his chair, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eerie silence blanketed the office, broken only by the steady rhythm of the wall clock marking time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis knew all too well that Sherwood&#39;s calculated planning meant he was ready to escalate his  campaign  against the Sampson family. When it came to Sherwood&#39;s methods, the man would likely stop at nothing. The urgent priority now was alerting Sampson Group&#39;s core members, ensuring everyone was mentally prepared and wouldn&#39;t be blindsided by Sherwood&#39;s next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fingers pressed against his temples as Luis tried to massage away the tension that had been building for some days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick glance at the clock confirmed it was time.He rose from his chair, straightened his tie, and made his way toward the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he pushed open the door, animated conversations died mid-sentence. Every pair of eyes swiveled toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sampson Group&#39;s most trusted senior members occupied seats around the long rectangular conference table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the left side of the table&#39;s head sat an elder gentleman, silver threading through his temples,though his ggaze remained razor-sharp. For years, he&#39;d served as Luis&#39; most valued business advisor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him, a middle-aged woman with a precise bob cut adjusted her elegant gold-rimmed glasses. Her stern expression matched her reputation for cutting  straight to the point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the right side of the table&#39;s head stood Luis &#39; longtime capable assistant, Neville Salazar. His tall frame carried a resolute bearing that radiated pure efficiency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remaining seats held elites from their respective fields, each renowned for exceptional ability and unwavering loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis approached the conference table&#39;s head,palms pressing against its surface as his gaze swept the assembled group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brief silence preceded his words, lips barely parting as he spoke. &#34;Everyone, I&#39;ve called you here because Sampson Group faces an unprecedented crisis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his words settled, tension thickened the air. Every person straightened in their chair, breath held in complete attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing a measured breath, Luis&#39; expression grew grave as he unveiled Sherwood&#39;s entire scheme.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Astonishment rippled through the room once the revelation concluded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare Sherwood commit such outrageous betrayal!&#34; The elder gentleman on the left struck the table with his fist, sending documents fluttering. &#34;Exactly! Sampson Group has always conducted business with integrity.How could he frame us like this!&#34;Another member voiced his agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis lifted his hand, commanding silence before continuing. &#34;We now possess evidence of his conspiracy. However, our immediate priority is stabilizing Sampson Group&#39;s internal situation. We absolutely cannot afford to panic. Losing our composure would be handing Sherwood exactly what he wants. Furthermore, we cannot let the outside world detect even a hint of weakness. In business, the smallest disturbance can trigger massive stock market fluctuations, and our partners might begin questioning our reliability.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this, a senior member&#39;s hand rose with a question.&#34;Mr. Sampson, should we take the initiative and expose Sherwood&#39;s conspiracy now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis shook his head, maintaining his composed demeanor as he responded, &#34;Now isn&#39;t the time.While we have evidence, it&#39;s not yet sufficient. Rash action could alert Sherwood, giving him the chance to destroy evidence or even escalate to more extreme measures.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused deliberately, eyes narrowing with a calculating gleam as his words came slowly.&#34;We must wait for the perfect moment to bring Sherwood down.&#34;</p>
