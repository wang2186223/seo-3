                <p>Verena slipped into the booth and sat opposite Ivan, who hadn&#39;t taken his eyes off her since the moment she walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you staring at me like that?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elbows resting lazily on the table, Ivan flashed a sly grin. &#34;It&#39;s been a while. You&#39;ve grown even more radiant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, Verena wore a snow-white silk blouse, a black ribbon tied at the collar into a bow that looked casual yet refined-an elegant balance between grace and authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matched with deep blue skinny jeans that hugged her slender legs, her attire, paired with her striking features, made it nearly impossible to look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan&#39;s words weren&#39;t just hollow flattery;they carried weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Verena shot him a sharp glare. &#34;You never change, do you? Still can&#39;t keep yourself in line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried the tone of an elder sister chastising a younger brother-stern on the surface, yet threaded with warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning remorse, he clasped his hands together, bowing his head. &#34;My fault, Verena. I was out of line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved despite herself, but she quickly straightened. &#34;Enough games. Tell me-what&#39;s this about?Did you run into trouble again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it hadn&#39;t been serious, Ivan wouldn&#39;t have insisted on a face-to-face talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head slowly. &#34;No. It&#39;s not about me.It&#39;s about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s brows drew together. &#34;Abot me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Ivan&#39;s nod was grave. &#34;A few days ago, I hacked into a site.&#34; Her eyes narrowed. &#34;What kind of site?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An assassin&#39;s website,&#34; he replied evenly. &#34;I was poking around out of boredom and stumbled onto something-a contract from months ago. It was tied to your grandmother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shawna-Verena&#39;s one tender spot, the very wound that never healed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot to her feet. &#34;What happened to my grandmother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her agitation, Ivan reached out quickly, pressing her back into the seat.&#34;Don&#39;t get worked up. Let me explain first. Hear me out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He unlocked his phone, pulled up a screenshot, and slid it across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes locked on the image. Her body trembled as though struck by a thunderbolt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an anonymous contract, the bounty modest but clear in its one demand: the woman in the attached photo must die. The image was Shawna-snapped secretly, without her knowledge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan frowned. &#34;Strange, isn&#39;t it? Your grandmother was just an ordinary woman. Yet the person who offered the bounty wanted her death masked as an accident. Who would go to such lengths?&#34; Staring at the photo, Verena&#39;s hands shook uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage surged like a storm tide; her eyes burned red, and the world blurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So... Grandma was murdered,&#34; she whispered through clenched teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart ached imagining Shawna-gentle, kind, unaware-forced into fear she never deserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And guilt cut deep; Verena loathed herself for failing to shield her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her shoulders quake, Ivan laid his hands gently on them, his voice low. &#34;The bounty was marked as claimed. The job was carried out. Don&#39;t torture yourself too much, Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Months ago, Verena had rushed back to Akoitha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan had heard from Julianna then-it was for a funeral. Verena&#39;s fists tightened, nails digging into her palms. Her mind reeledd, racing through possible culprits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shawna, who harmed no one, quarreled only over trivial village matters-none of which could ever justify this. Rural folk wouldn&#39;t even know such a website existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes narrowed to slits. One name surfaced. Laura. The only person in this world who&#39;d rather Shawna hadn&#39;t lived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she bolted from the booth, ignoring Ivan&#39;s startled calls behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena sped to Willis Villa, every mile burning with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she stepped out, the household staff, who once treated her with cold indifference,now hurried over, all smiles and bows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them said, &#34;Mrs. Bennett, welcome! Here to see Mr. and Mrs. Willis? Someone has already gone to announce your arrival. Please, this way...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move!&#34; The word shot from her clenched jaw, her eyes cold as a winter&#39;sblade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant froze, shivered, and scrambled aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stormed forward. Laura and Alec descended the staircase, their faces bright with delight as though dawn had broken inside their home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant&#39;s report had seemed impossible, for Verena had publicly driven them out of her hospital&#39;s opening ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet here she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their smiles widened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena,,my dear, you missed your mother after all, didn&#39;t you? I knew it. No rift lasts forever between mother and daughter.&#34; Laura&#39;s face glowed as she reached for Verena&#39;s hand. But the very next heartbeat shattered her illusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena seized her wrist and clamped down on her throat with the other hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec&#39;s eyes widened in horror. &#34;Verena, stop! That&#39;s your mother!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Verena&#39;s fury drowned out his plea. Her eyes blazed with fire as she demanded, &#34;Was it you? Did you send someone to kill my grandmother? Answer me! Was it you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura froze, stunned as though lightning had struck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had expected reconciliation, not accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice shook as she struggled against Verena&#39;s grip. &#34;I... I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about...It wasn&#39;t me, I swear...I wouldn&#39;t dare...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were wide, full of fear and confusion, as though Verena had cast her into a nightmare without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air itself grew suffocating, heavy with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stared at Laura&#39;s trembling form, and then shut her eyes briefly. Her anger eased, just slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, she loosened her hold and drew in a sharp breath, forcing herself to calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Released, Laura staggered back, clutching her throat as a fit of coughing wracked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color rushed into her cheeks, her heart pounding-in fright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen something terrifying in Verena&#39;s face-like an animal cornered, baring its fangs,ready to tear into flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, Verena&#39;s eyes opened again, her gaze fixed on Laura..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No... it wasn&#39;t Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew it deep down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura might have disliked Shawna, but Shawna&#39;s quiet country life posed no threat. There was no gain in plotting her death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena took a step back, confusion replacing fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not Laura,then who?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would stoop to targeting a defenseless old woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or-was this somehow about her identity as Evelyn?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she had always been cautious. Abroad, her identity and family ties remained hidden from prying eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her temples throbbed; her head felt heavy with questions. She turned sharply and walked away.</p>
