                <p>Kaia no longer shrank away from seeing Verena.Revenge remained her driving force, and disguise was a role she wore with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a tone full of confidence, she assured Katelyn,&#34;When I apologized before, Verena forgave me without hesitation. Don&#39;t worry, Katelyn. A small trick is enough to make her soften again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Katelyn had little faith in Kaia&#39;s cleverness, she knew Kaia was still the most suitable person to approach Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing her lips together, Katelyn answered, &#34;I&#39;ll wait for your success.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, Kaia stepped out of her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the living room, Laura was watching television when footsteps echoed from the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she glanced up and spotted Kaia with a handbag in hand, she asked with curiosity, &#34;Kaia, are you going out to meet some friends?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trauma of Kaia&#39;s disappearance had left Laura wary;now she made a habit of checking in whenever her daughter planned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her spot near the staircase, Kaia glanced at Alec,who sat behind his newspaper, seemingly lost in the day&#39;s headlines. She hadn&#39;t forgotten how much Alec valued Verena&#39;s status. His satisfaction had been clear when Kaia suggested mending fences with Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a bright tone and a practiced smile, Kaia called out, &#34;Mom, I&#39;m not seeing friends tonight. I&#39;m going to Verena&#39;s, and I might stay over a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura paused in surprise, trying to figure out when Kaia had grown so familiar with that problematic Verena.After thinking it over, though, she decided it might actually be a good thing. No matter what happened,Verena&#39;s status couldn&#39;t be ignored, and keeping closer ties with her could only work in their favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deciding to support the idea, Laura returned the smile.&#34;That&#39;s nice. You girls deserve a chance to catch up as sisters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, you&#39;re spending a few days with Verena?&#34; Alec put aside his newspaper and stood up, his face showing mild surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia caught the faint surprise in his eyes, yet she could tell he approved of what she was going to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded quickly and said, &#34;Yes. Verena has been back for a while, but I hardly ever got to spend time  alone with her. I know I hurt her a lot in the past,and now that she&#39;s finally forgiven me, I want to make it right. Just like Mom said, it&#39;s time for us to catch up as sisters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec&#39;s smile softened as if a weight had lifted. &#34;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re thinking like that. You and Verena share the same blood. No fight can ever erase that bond.If you stand by each other, then when trouble comes,neither of you will face it alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rarely did Alec show this kind of warmth.For once,he looked like a genuine father, gently guiding his daughter toward love and loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia,however,understood the real reason behind his smile. He longed to reach out to Verena himself, yet pride kept him from doing it, so he counted on herto bridge the gap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she kept that thought to herself. Instead, she gave a polite nod and said, &#34;I understand, Dad.I&#39;ve always remembered what you&#39;ve told me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a short pause, she brightened her smile. &#34;Dad,Mom, I&#39;ll be out tonight, so don&#39;t worry about making dinner for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her determination sharpened as she thought of the task Katelyn had entrusted to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she moved toward the door, Alec called out, &#34;Kaia...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ongoing troubles with the club had left him cornered, unsure of how to move forward. However,Kaia&#39;s plan to visit Verena and stay for a few days hinted at a shift in their relationship. Should Kaia succeed in gaining Verena&#39;s support or speaking favorably for Willis Group, the balance of the situation with the club could finally lean in their favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alec&#39;s pride stood in the way, making it impossible for him to ask his daughter outright for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his daughter,Kaia could read his thoughts with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered a gentle smile and said, &#34;Dad, I&#39;m your daughter, and I&#39;m part of the Willis family. I&#39;ve always thought about what&#39;s best for us. I know the club troubles are weighing on you, but trust me. I&#39;ll do my best to talk to Verena and ask her to ease up on Willis Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even without speaking their full minds, both believed they understood exactly what the other wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia left the Willis Villa and set off toward Verena&#39;s home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Rhonda informed her of Kaia&#39;s arrival, Verena&#39;s mouth curved into a sly smile. The last visit had been  full of tearful apologies and begging for forgiveness.This time, she wondered what sort of trick Kaia had prepared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena pushed her papers aside, slipped into a coat,and headed down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she reached the bottom step, Kaia was already inside, tugging a silver suitcase across the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia looked up, her face breaking into a bright smile.&#34;Verena!&#34; she caled out warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sweet tone sent a shiver down Verena&#39;s back.Pulling her coat a little tighter, she forced a casual smile and asked, &#34;What&#39;s with the big suitcase?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia strolled over and slipped her arm through Verena&#39;s. &#34;We&#39;ve got a short holiday break,&#34; she said cheerfully. &#34;My school club is holding aget-together near here, so I thought I&#39;d stay with you for a few days.And I figured you might be lonely, rattling around this house by yourself, so I came to keep you company.You don&#39;t mind, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice rang wit sugar, the kind that made her sound like an innocent little sister doting on her elder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Verena scoffed. The whole point of that school club event was to build friendship,yet Kaia had shown up here. There was no doubt she had another  agenda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena didn&#39;t buy for a second that Kaia came just to ease her loneliness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thought struck her, and her gaze sharpened.If Kaia&#39;s earlier vanishing act had anything to do with Katelyn,then this visit reeked of Katelyn&#39;s orders. The reason was plain enough-Kaia had been sent to spy on her.And if that was the game, Verena decided she would make sure there was more than enough for Kaia to report back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking that,Verena let her lips curl into a faint smile.She looked at Kaia and gave a small nod. &#34;Of course.Stay as long as you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia hid her smirk, mocking silently how quickly Verena had swallowed the act. She had expected it to take more work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia steadied her tone, put on a sweet smile,and said,&#34;You really are the best, Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena slipped her arm free and said calmly, &#34;Rhonda,take Kaia&#39;s bag upstairs and prepare a room for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda gave a quick nod before hauling the suitcase up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ringtone chimed from Verena&#39;s coat pocket. Verena checked the screen, and Kaia angled her head as though she might catch a glimpse. A second later,Verena locked the phone screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia quickly looked away, acting as if she hadn&#39;t noticed at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Verena caught the little move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a faint smile and remarked, &#34;I need to return this call upstairs. Make yourself comfortable here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia nodded like an obedient child. &#34;Okay,&#34; she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena walked into her study with the phone and dialed Ivan&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan picked up right away, his voice full of mock drama. &#34;My darling Verena, you really ignored me.I&#39;m crushed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena laughed, recognizing his teasing. &#34;I couldn&#39;t answer earlier. Someone was around, and it wasn&#39;t the right time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She changed the subject and asked, &#34;Were you able to take care of what I asked you to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan answered with smug pride, &#34;Of course I did. It was child&#39;s play. I&#39;ve already sent the restored video to  your email.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena smiled with satisfaction. &#34;Perfect. Thanks for that. I&#39;ll look at it right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, she grabbed her mouse and pulled up her inbox.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The footage slowed, and a gray car appeared on the screen. Out of nowhere, a black car swerved in front,cutting it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The black car rammed the gray one, forcing it into a sharp U-turn. But the moment it turned around,several other cars moved in from behind, closing the trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the video neared its end, a man dressed in black stepped out of one of the cars. His build and features didn&#39;t look like anyone from Akoitha or the nearby regions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena froze the screen when something caught her eye and zoomed in closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dark blue tattoo stretched across his right arm, its design unfamiliar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snapped a screenshot and forwarded it straight to her detective friend, Samuel Perez.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands flew over the keyboard. &#34;Samuel, I&#39;ve hit a  problem. Can you dig into this tattoo and tell me what it represents? Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His response arrived almost instantly. &#34;Leave it to me.&#34;</p>
