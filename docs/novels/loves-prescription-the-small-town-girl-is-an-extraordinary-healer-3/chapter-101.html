                <p>When Verena pressed for an answer,Isaac was left speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to clear things up, but couldn&#39;t find the words-after all, he had no idea what the engraved &#34;E&#34; actually meant himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He met her gaze, his face blank, lips parting as he stammered, &#34;I...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerves crept into his voice, so faint it nearly vanished between them. Sensing his unease, Verena decided not to push any further. She suddenly raised her voice in mock realization. &#34;Oh! That makes sense now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac blinked, watching as her eyes danced with mischief. &#34;&#39;E&#39; must be for the last letter in &#39;LOVE,&#39;right? Isaac, I never guessed you&#39;d be so clever about this stuff!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still frowning, about to say more, when Verena closed the distance and kissed his cheek. &#34;It&#39;s a wonderful present-thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joy lit up her eyes, and her voice came out in a gentle hush. Isaac caught the glow in her smile, held back what he was going to say, and let the mystery behind the letter &#34;E&#34; stay just that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered a smile in return, even if it felt a little stiff.&#34;If it makes you happy, that&#39;s all that matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Bennett Group, after wrapping up a meeting,Isaac made his way back to his office, where Jacob appeared at the door with a gentle knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34; Isaac replied, his thumbs pressing lightly at his temples, eyes closed as if collecting his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Handing over the phone, Jacob reported, &#34;Mr.Bennett, you missed a call from Mr. Barrie Lyons about ten minutes ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes opened and he nodded, replying, &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the office empty once more, Isaac dialed Barrie&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long for the line to connect, Barrie&#39;s raspy voice coming through. &#34;Isaac, is that you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s me, Mr. Lyons.&#34; Isaac&#39;s tone was respectful. &#34;How have you been these days?&#34; Barrie, always fond of Isaac&#39;s manners, let out a soft chuckle. &#34;I&#39;m doing well, thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief exchange, Barrie&#39;s voice turned serious.&#34;Isaac, there&#39;s something I need to ask you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead,&#34; Isaac replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you tell Beckett to close Alec&#39;s club?&#34; Barrie asked directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief flash of uncertainty passed through Isaac&#39;s eyes. Barrie rarely involved himself in affairs outside his own business; today&#39;s call was a clear break from the norm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered honestly, &#34;I did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why?&#34; Barrie&#39;s question carried both confusion and concern. &#34;Isaac, I&#39;m not trying to interfere, but Dr.Willis is not just Alec&#39;s daughter-she&#39;s also my savior.Now that her family&#39;s in trouble, I can&#39;t simply look away. I know you&#39;re a fair man, so I have to ask-did Alec wrong you in some way? Otherwise,why would you move against the Willis family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice softened, almost pleading. &#34;Your wedding to Dr. Willis is just around the corner. If word gets out,people will talk-they&#39;ll say you hold a grudge against your fiancée&#39;s family, or that you&#39;re trying to humiliate her. Alec may have his faults, but he&#39;s still her father. No matter what&#39;s happened, targeting her family this way only breeds bitterness between you two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening,Isaac realized why Barrie had reached out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He replied with genuine appreciation, &#34;Thank you for caring about Verena, Mr. Lyons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued, voice steady, &#34;Alec&#39;s never slighted me personally. But he&#39;s wronged my wife-and that&#39;s all that matters to me. Any so-called bitterness isn&#39;t a concern. I&#39;ve always been open with Verena about my actions against her father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrie fell silent, confusion written on his weathered face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Slater right? Was Isaac truly this devoted to Verena?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it really be that the entire Willis family faced Isaac&#39;s wrath because they had crossed Verena?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrie found himself at a loss, unable to make sense of Isaac&#39;s motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the silence stretched, Isaac decided to close the conversation. &#34;Don&#39;t trouble yourself about the club,Mr. Lyons. I&#39;ll make sure it&#39;s taken care of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He added with quiet confidence, &#34;And as for the person who saved your life-rest easy. I&#39;ll make sure she won&#39;t suffer any injustice.&#34;</p>
