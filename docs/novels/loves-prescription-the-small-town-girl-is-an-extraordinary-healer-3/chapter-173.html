                <p>Katelyn had no desire to waste time in idle chatter with Kaia; all she wanted was obedience. So, with a quick diversion, she texted, &#34;Kaia,you won&#39;t let me down this time, will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time Katelyn had ordered her to drug lsaac,Kaia never learned what had followed. Since Katelyn never mentioned it again, Kaia felt it unwise to pry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Katelyn was turning to her once more, Kaia took it as a sign of deep trust and assumed Katelyn and Isaac must have already shared intimacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brimming with confidence, Kaia replied, &#34;Don&#39;t worry.I won&#39;t disappoint you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s lips twisted into a mocking smile. How many times had this foolish woman failed her already? She could only hope Kaia wouldn&#39;t stumble yet again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Kaia replied, she quickly forwarded the scandalous news to the chat group of the city&#39;s wealthy youth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, dozens of messages poured in like a flood. Hearing the constant pings, Kaia sat quietly, savoring the uproar as though she were watching a stage play unravel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I really seeing this? Verena is actually some mysterious girlfriend to an older foreigner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget his age-Tobin is a giant overseas. Otherwise,how would Verena get entangled with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who would have guessed Verena could be so reckless? Isn&#39;t she lsaac&#39;s wife? And yet she&#39;s having an affair abroad. Is the grass aways greener across the fence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold it-Bobby&#39;s still in the group. Maybe watch your tongues.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the saying goes, speak of the devil and he appears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby clicked the link, and his heart lurched. After a deep breath, he suspected it was nothing but fabrication. He trusted Verena too much to believe otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fired back, &#34;Why spread baseless rumors, Kaia? Are you so idle you&#39;ve nothing better to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sharp rebuke made everyone realize Kaia was the one who had fanned the flames. The discussion flared anew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right, wasn&#39;t there that time Kaia slandered her own sister? Could this be the same trick again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quite possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought she had mended her ways after Slater put her in her place. Didn&#39;t expect her to stir the pot again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But did you watch the video? It&#39;s hard to fake that.Verena even held the man&#39;s arm-hardly a sign of strangers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. And didn&#39;t you hear him call her &#39;sweetheart&#39;?Who calls a stranger that? Something is surely brewing between them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come to think of it, that makes sense. But with the Bennett family&#39;s standing, why would she need to look elsewhere?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Simple-maybe she craved excitement. Besides,Tobin isn&#39;t just anyone. His influence abroad matches the Bennetts&#39; at home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, the young elites suddenly felt they understood:however wealthy or handsome Isaac was,with his current condition, he was not like other men and could not offer the kind of fulfillment a woman naturally longed for. As the gossip grew wilder, Bobby&#39;s fury boiled over.He tagged Kaia directly. &#34;Kaia, are you courting disaster? How dare you frame my sister-in-law again?Wasn&#39;t the last lesson enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornered, Kaia abandoned her silence and typed,&#34;Sorry,everyone. I meant to delete the unfavorable news about my sister but mistakenly forwarded it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning innocence, she added sweet poison.&#34;Although I don&#39;t know why my sister would fall into such a roe, I still choose to believe her. Please, act as if you never saw this. I beg you-don&#39;t share it further.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew human nature well; the more you told these privileged rebels not to spread something, the faster they carried it like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so it reached Barrie&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he watched the video, Barrie&#39;s shock was great,but his faith in Verena was greater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had once saved his life, and gratitude bound him to defend her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fearing Danica might see the report and take it at face value,he rang her without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call connected, he rushed out, &#34;Danica,don&#39;t believe that foreign report.I assure you-Verena  is not such a woman. She&#39;ll never betray lsaac like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice grew steadier. &#34;You may not know, but when Verena treated me abroad, countless young men of talent and wealth pursued her. I witnessed it myself.If she ever chose someone, it wouldn&#39;t be an older man.Most likely, she traveled for medical duty. Don&#39;t let this rumor cast a shadow-she truly is remarkable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Danica was puzzled, but once Verena&#39;s name was spoken, she realized Barrie had seen the same report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words overflowed with praise and trust so firm it stirred her heart. And indeed, if what he said held true,Verena did have better choices. The story seemed flimsy at best; it was unlikely Verena would trample the Bennett family&#39;s honor that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts settled, Danica smiled and replied warmly, &#34;Thank you for calling. Verena is my daughter -in-law-I know her well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few more courtesies, Barrie-pressed with other matters-ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had he hung up than he dialed Isaac. As Verena&#39;s husband, Isaac had to trust her and mustn&#39;t be misled by the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the line connected, Barrie wasted	no  time: &#34;Isaac, did you see that foreign media report?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be clear, he added, &#34;The one spreading lies about Verena and Tobin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac answered evenly, &#34;I&#39;ve seen it...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Barrie cut in. &#34;It&#39;s false, every word! Don&#39;t believe it. Verena is not that kind of woman. You&#39;ve-no idea-when she was treating me abroad, young talents and handsome men queued daily to invite her to dinner. She wouldn&#39;t spare a glance at a man so much older than her. These reports are just idle tongues wagging. Pay them no mind...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrie&#39;s voice carried on, but Isaac had already seized on one point: young talents and handsome men queued up daily to invite her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed, jealousy twisting in his chest. He couldn&#39;t help but wonder-had she ever accepted?</p>
