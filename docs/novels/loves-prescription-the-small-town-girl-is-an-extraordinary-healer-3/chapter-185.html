                <p>Bobby had been keeping his eyes on the exit when the moment caught his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting his head for a better look, he murmured curiously, &#34;Who&#39;s that guy with Verena? Pretty sharp-looking, isn&#39;t he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s expression tightened, his brow knitting ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby had only spoken in passing and didn&#39;t pick up on the slight shift in his brother&#39;s expression.Spotting Verena moving in their direction, he broke into a grin and waved enthusiastically. &#34;Verena! Over here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her steps slowed at the sound of his voice, and she turned her head toward the familiar call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side stood Bobby in a loose tracksuit,grinning like a fool and waving his arm high. Beside him, Isaac sat in his wheelchair, dressed in a sleek black suit, a bouquet of white roses resting in his hands. His smile was calm, almost tender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall around them was crowded and noisy, yet their presence stood out in the sea of travelers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both men were watching her closely, wvaiting for her to reach them, their smiles filled with warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Verena, the sight stirred something deep in her chest. Since Shawna&#39;s death, no one had stood waiting for her with that kind of anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft light entered her eyes, and her lips curved as she walked toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re finally back,&#34; Bobby said, rushing to grab her suitcase before she could protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome home,&#34; Isaac added gently, holding the bouquet out to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s gaze lingered on the flowers, her surprise written across her face.</p>
