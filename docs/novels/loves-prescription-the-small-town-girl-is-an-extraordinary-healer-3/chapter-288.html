                <p>After listening to the young nurse&#39;s complaint, Verena felt frustration rise within her likea tide she could not hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Luis was not the kind of man one could simply brush aside, so she gave a small nod. &#34;I understand. Please ask him to wait a moment. I&#39;ll put on my white coat first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned and slipped into the changing room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Verena emerged, neatly dressed in her white coat, and made her way to the nurses&#39; station to face Luis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There he stood, calm as a seasoned actor on his own stage. With hands buried in his pockets and his body leaning lazily against the counter, he carried himself as though the entire station belonged to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His high nose and tightly pressed lips, drawn slightly downward at the corners, gave off a brooding presence-like winter shadows stretching across the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurses instinctively kept their distance, treating him as one would a storm cloud-best avoided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena neared, her gaze lingered on the figure who seemed carved out of authority itself. She spoke softly.&#34;Mr. Sampson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her voice, Luis-who only a heartbeat earlier had stood in studied nonchalance-snapped upright as though a schoolboy unexpectedly called on in class. He tugged his hands free from his pockets and faced her directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, his stern features softened, betraying a flicker of unease, as if he were eager to show his best side before her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the years spent in the underworld had left him with a gravity not so easily shaken, giving him an odd mix of contradiction-both intimidating and faintly endearing. Verena, however, wasted no thought on his changing expression. She asked directly, &#34;Mr. Sampson, what brings you here? This is a hospital, and your constant visits are hardly appropriate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes remained clear as spring water, though their chill revealed a certain distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words, cool as frost, made Luis curl his fingers unconsciously. A sting of sorrow pricked him-his sister&#39;s heart was still closed to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew such bonds could not be mended overnight; time alone could test his patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed hislips into a thin line, bitterness flickering across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet soon he inhaled deeply, as though summoning courage from the very air, and his posture straightened,his expression solemn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Bennett,&#34; he began, voice low and hoarse, carrying a weight of sincerity. &#34;I know my past actions bewildered you-and at times, even offended you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his head, as if bowing beneath the burden of his own shame. &#34;So here and now, I offer you my heartfelt apology for the rudeness and presumption I once showed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With deliberate care, he leaned forward and bent in a deep bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every movement was unhurried,solemn-etched with genuine intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment froze; nurses and patients passing by cast curious glances, but Luis seemed blind to their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s own eyes flickered-confusion stirring within them. His sudden apology struck her as both unexpected and puzzling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted, ready to speak, but before she could utter a word, Luis pressed on. &#34;But today, I came for more than apologies. I have something crucial to tell you. Will you grant me a little of your time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression remained composed, her tone clipped. &#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis glanced around at the crowded corridors. &#34;A hospital is too noisy for such words. Perhaps we could find a quieter place to talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes swept the busy corridors-doctors and nurses in motion, families brimming with anxiety.Indeed,hardly the ground for a private talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But memory reminded her: he had used this very excuse before, only to leave her with silence and confusion. Wariness flickered in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to have a lengthy conversation with him in some restaurant like before, she said, &#34;Follow me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned on her heel and walked toward the far end of the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis, catching her intent, gestured to his assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A folder was swiftly handed over, which Luis clutched before hurrying after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena led him into the hospital&#39;s rehabilitation garden, where meandering streams, shaded trees, and clusters of flowers formed a refuge apart from the world&#39;s clamor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They strolled along winding paths until they reached an artificial lake. Beneath the glassy surface,fish darted in sudden flashes of silver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benches dotted the lakesidey and Verena chose one, seating herself with calm composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up at him, she said evenly, &#34;Mr. Sampson, it&#39;s quiet enough here. Please, get to the point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis gave a small nod and, after a moment&#39;s hesitation, lowered himself onto the bench, careful to keep a respectful distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The truth is...&#34; He began slowly, his hands restless on his thighs, his eyes flickering toward her now and then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena sat poised, hands folded on her lap, her calm gaze fixed on the lake as though she had all the time in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; words faltered, his Adam&#39;s apple rising and falling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within the folder lay the DNA results-evidence binding him and Verena together. Just one sentence could unveil the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the memory of his inappropriate words to her in the past twisted inside him, leaving him entangled in hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What would she do when she finally learned their true bond? And how would she think of him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows drew tight, his eyes clouded with struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One hand clutched the folder as though it were a lifeline, while the other rubbed his thigh in restless motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s patience, though steady, was not endless. Seeing his hesitation, she assumed he was once again tricking her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her frown deepened; her voice sharpened with impatience as she rose to her feet. &#34;Mr. Sampson, our cooperation already ended. If you have nothing to say, I&#39;ll take my leave. And another thing...&#34; She paused,turning coldly toward him. &#34;We are strangers. I hope you&#39;ll keep your distance. I have a family of my own,and my husband would never welcome this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words cut clear as glass. She turned as though to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stab of pain pierced Luis&#39; chest. Before thought could steady him, instinct seized his body. He stepped forward and caught her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena-I&#39;m your brother.&#34; His voice rang with urgency, trembling as it broke through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena froze, her face suddenly a canvas of shock and disbelief, her mind caught between denial and confusion.</p>
