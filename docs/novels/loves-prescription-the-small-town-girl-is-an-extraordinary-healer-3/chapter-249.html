                <p>With a subtle smile, Verena glanced away, her voice soft as she said, &#34;I haven&#39;t been here for long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon had just·settled into his seat when Verena spoke again. &#34;Dr. Moss, to be honest, I invited you today to apologize for my husband&#39;s situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words caught Simon off guard. He froze for a moment, his fork suddenly still in his hand,the smile on his face faltering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So it was about lsaac after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of irritation washed over him, mixing with an undercurrent of jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was it about that man that always seemed to dominate their conversations?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What made Isaac so special?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she so obsessed with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His frustration grew as he realized how he&#39;d missed the implication in Verena&#39;s message earlier. The personal matter... it was Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his mind was in chaos, Simon swiftly hid his feelings,managing a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing else mattered; just being able to see her was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He believed that, no matter her intentions or her heart&#39;s loyalty to another man, he could still take his place in the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He adjusted his posture and cleared his throat, doing his best to keep his voice steady. &#34;Mr. Bennett&#39;s case is complicated, but I&#39;m confident I can help him.Evelyn, are you sure you don&#39;t want me to continue his treatment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena took a sip of her coffee,and then replied softly, &#34;Dr. Moss, I truly appreciate your help, but l must honor my husband&#39;s wishes. If he&#39;s unwilling,I won&#39;t press him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each time she spoke of her husband with such affection,it gnawed at Simon, making the jealousy simmer just beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s grip on the fork tightened, his knuckles whitening as the storm of emotions within him swirled,threatening to break free. Noticing his tension, Verena spoke calmly. &#34;Dr. Moss,perhaps you don&#39;t understand. The bond my husband and I share goes beyond what most couples experience. Our love is so deep that we never impose on each other. Do you understand that, Dr.Moss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words, soft yet piercing,stirred a whirlwind inside Simon, each syllable fanning the flames of his frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, he raised his hand, fingers instinctively trying to pull at his hair to calm the rising tension within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Verena noticed it, she went on high alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was something Carl did right before he lost control of his emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Simon&#39;s hand dropped instead to adjust his glasses,his face tight as he forced a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see,&#34; he said stiffly, his voice tight. &#34;Your relationship with Mr. Bennett seems truly special.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s brow furrowed slightly, a flicker of suspicion crossing her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout their conversation,she had probed subtly but found no answers. She wondered if it was because Simon had no connection to Carl, or because he was  just exceptionally skilled at hiding it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When their conversation wrapped up, so did the meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they stepped outside the restaurant, Simon politely suggested, &#34;Evelyn, how about I give you a ride?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking her head, Verena replied, &#34;There&#39;s no need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ignored her refusal, opening the passenger door and offering her a hand to help her in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena was about to speak, a familiar voice cut in,&#34;It seems you&#39;re having some trouble understanding,Dr. Moss. My wife has made herself perfectly clear,hasn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a steady, authoritative tone, the voice allowed no space for doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around, Verena and Simon saw Jacob wheeling Isaac in their direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A twitch flickered at the corner of Simon&#39;s mouth as he clenched his fists by his sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bright smile spread across Verena&#39;s face as she rushed toward Isaac. She kissed his cheek before turning to Simon. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Dr. Moss. My husband&#39;s been waiting for quite some time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then addressed Isaac with a warmth that seemed  to fill the air. &#34;Shall we go, darling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice, laced with joy and affection, made Simon&#39;s stomach churn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, Verena helped Isaac into the car.The engine roared to life, and they began to drive away, the sound of the car fading as it disappeared down the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon remained seated in his car, staring through the rearview mirror at the black car retreating into the distance. The image of Verena&#39;s kiss on Isaac&#39;s cheek replayed in his mind, fueling the flames of jealousy and anger that burned in his chest. His heart seemed to sink deeper with every passing second, drowning in bitterness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did his feelings for her seem so insignificant to Verena, while Isaac, who offered nothing, had captured her entirely? It made no sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp pang of pain flickered in Simon&#39;s eyes. He was overwhelmed with a loss he couldn&#39;t quite express, a bitterness too raw for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration and confusion twisted within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head dropped as he tugged at his hair, the intensity on his face bordering on frightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally looked up, his fingers gripped strands  of broken hair, and his eyes were bloodshot, veins standing out against the skin of his face, making him look almost unrecognizable.</p>
