                <p>Luis opened the office door, clad in a crisp new suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His collar was buttoned to the top, the tie falling in perfect order across his chest.He carried himself with the poise of a man firmly in control, his expression clean of even the faintest hint of impropriety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His back was straight, his stride measured, as he moved toward Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stood there, her eyes fixed on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis met her gaze, his face unreadable. The calm steadiness in his eyes was the same as ever-detached,almost indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That cool composure unsettled Verena, making her wonder if the compromising scene she had witnessed earlier had been nothing more than a trick of her imagination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice came low, even, without a crack in its surface. &#34;Verena, what&#39;s the matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she looked up, a faint scent of fresh shower gel lingered in the air. Her lips parted to speak, but at that moment Luis &#39;assistant hurried over from the far side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning close, the assistant whispered, &#34;Mr.Sampson,the meeting begins in three minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis gave the slightest nod before turning back to her.&#34;Go on-say what you wanted to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena shook her head softly. &#34;Go handle your meeting. I&#39;ve got work too. We can talk later-it isn&#39;t urgent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting second, apology flickered in Luis&#39; eyes.He offered her a quiet, &#34;Sorry,&#34; and then walked off with his assistant toward the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena didn&#39;t see it, but as soon as he turned,unease and resignation shadowed his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..·</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That very day, Verena flew back to Shoildon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following evening, she recounted to Isaac what she had seen between Luis and Miranda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should have seen it. Had I not been there, I&#39;d never believe Luis could lose control like that,&#34;Verena said as she placed the needles into Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lifted his eyes slightly, curiosity flickering there. &#34;Truly? I never thought Luis had that in him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the world, Luis had always worn a mask of arrogance and icy composure, an untouchable hauteur that set him apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed as though nothing on earth could rattle him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So the idea of such a man stumbling over a woman bordered on the unthinkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,&#34; Verena replied, a trace of mischief brightening her eyes. &#34;He&#39;s always held everyone at arm&#39;s length. And yet, along comes Miranda.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a gentle sigh. &#34;From the way he behaves around her, he never stood a chance. She&#39;s his Achilles&#39; heel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And then?&#34; Isaac asked evenly. He cared little for Luis &#39; affairs, yet he found more amusement in the sparkle of Verena&#39;s storytelling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena shrugged,carefully removing the needles one by one. &#34;Then he carried on as though nothing had happened,walking straight into his meeting.If not for the fresh clothes and that lingering scent of shower gel, I might have doubted my own eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pictured it, a quiet laugh slipping from his lips. When she finished, she said, &#34;Don&#39;t move yet. Take a  moment to rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he had, Verena took his arms firmly and helped him rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her steady support, Isaac drew in a deep breath and eased his legs toward the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant his feet touched down, his brow furrowed.A sharp soreness surged through his muscles,making his movements falter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his struggle, Verena instinctively tightened her hold, murmuring gently, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve got you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac clenched his jaw, forcing his body to obey. He lifted one foot. The movement was shaky, stiff-but not as rigid as before.</p>
