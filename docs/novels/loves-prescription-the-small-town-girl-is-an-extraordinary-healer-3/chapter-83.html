                <p>In Isaac&#39;s eyes, his action was born of jealousy. Utterly absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet he had to admit to himself, the green-eyed monster had taken hold of him. He envied his own younger brother, of all people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby possessed the kind of background and capability that matched his own, along with the advantage of a strong and healthy body. Standing side by side, Bobby seemed far more fitting for Verena. Any woman weighing her options would almost certainly pick Bobby. And yet...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s arms tightened, holding Verena as though she were his anchor in a storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would never permit anyone to steal her away-not even his own brother. That was a line he could never allow to be crossed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lashes, thick and unyielding, drooped and brushed against Verena&#39;s skin, leaving her itching, while his uneven breaths fanned over her bare shoulder, summoning tiny goosebumps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena instinctively drew back her shoulders, her slender fingers tracing idle circles in his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice, husky yet soft, broke the stillness. &#34;Isaac, you&#39;re different today... what&#39;s troubling you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew him well enough to sense it. That kiss earlier had not belonged to the lsaac she had grown accustomed to after his memory loss. Something had stirred him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac raised his head and brushed her lips with his own, his breath deep, steady, almost deliberate. Instead of replying, he countered, &#34;Do you have feelings for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was serious, the kind of question not asked in passing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lips curved faintly, her eyes carrying quiet mirth. &#34;Why such a sudden question?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light in Isaac&#39;s eyes dimmed; her answer had evaded him. With deliberate care, he tilted her chin upward,his gaze lingering on her lips-rosy, moist, and impossibly tempoting. Narrowing his eyes slightly, his breath deepened. &#34;Forget it,&#34; he murmured. &#34;Whether you do or not, it&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>enough that l love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And before another word could rise between them, he kissed her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, it was no gentle touch. He claimed every breath she drew, fierce and demanding, as though he</p>
                
                
                
                <p>could tether her soul to his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held her so tightly their chests pressed together, each heartbeat a drumbeat of longing. Every motionevery inhalation revealed the cracks in his armor-his deep-rooted insecurity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, their mingled breaths slowed, and silence reclaimed the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, lips tingling and numb, gasped for air, her chest heaving before she steadied herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she had gathered her composure, she gently lifted lsaac&#39;s head from her shoulder. &#34;lsaac, truly...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>what&#39;s happening with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, she was only curious about his unusual behavior. Now, she needed an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lowered his gaze, unwiling to unveil the truth. &#34;it&#39;s nothing,&#34; he said softly. &#34;Jjust some work matters</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wearing me down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes glimmered faintly as he spoke, and Verena frowned. She could see right through it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Work matters wearing him down? For lsaac, who thrived on work like air? That excuse wouldn&#39;t convince asoul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips pressed into a thin line. &#34;You...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could continue, lsaac cut across her words. &#34;Because of your family affairs, our marriage wasdelayed once before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked, unsure why he suddenly raised the subject, And then he declared, &#34;Let&#39;s register our marriagetomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a request. A decision carved in stone. Verena studied him in disbelief, searching for a trace of jest-there was none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So suddenly?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, a flicker of unease flashed through his eyes, his voice stiff. &#34;You don&#39;t want to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though caught off guard by his abruptness, once she collected herself, she nodded. &#34;Of course I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Isaac was already waiting outside Verena&#39;s hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dressing and gathering her documents, she was about to leave when a message from him lit up her phone: &#34;Remember to bring the documents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since leaving her the previous day, he had been sending the same reminder, as though chanting a mantra, terrified she might have second thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing by the elevator, Verena typed back, &#34;I know. If you scroll through our chat, you&#39;ll see you&#39;ve reminded me more than twenty times already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she stepped outside, a black car waited by the roadside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver, spotting her, hurried forward to open the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena offered a smile of thanks. Once she was seated, Isaac&#39;s first words were, &#34;The documents?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half amused,half exasperated, she pulled them from her bag. &#34;Why don&#39;t you hold onto them yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He accepted them, and only then did his tension seem to dissolve, a faint smile tuggingat his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car rolled forward toward the courthouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac picked up her ID card, eyes resting on the photo. ID pictures often betrayed their owners-washed-out faces,awkward expressions. But hers was different. Her features were refined, her complexion smooth as porcelain. Dressed in a black jacket, she looked spirited, though the fit was slightly oversized, broadening her shoulders unnaturally-a borrowed garment, no doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered. Verena noticed. Did he remember something? &#34;Something on your mind?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lifted his head, earnest as ever. &#34;Very beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena blinked, taken aback, and then tilted her head. &#34;That&#39;s all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing her dissatisfaction, he hesitated before adding, &#34;I&#39;ve never seen anyone as beautiful as you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her laughter slipped out softly. He hadn&#39;t remembered the past. She nodded, saying nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac frowned, unsure if her reaction was delight or disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her gaze toward the window, catching sight of the card in his hand. That very card had been obtained under his insistence. On that day, she&#39;d shown up in only a white blouse. Because ID photos required dark clothing, Isaac had wordlessly stripped off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him scrutinize the photo a moment ago, she had thought he might have recalled a fragment of that moment.But perhaps... memories required patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the car drew to a stop before the courthouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got out, Verena pushing his wheelchair forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the hall was quiet, with few people about. Following the staff&#39;s guidance, they filled in their forms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the final step approached, Isaac caught hushed voices behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it strange, marrying a man with a disability?&#34; a man whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His companion nudged him sharply, murmuring, &#34;Shh, they&#39;ll hear you,&#34; before the two stifled laughter.</p>
