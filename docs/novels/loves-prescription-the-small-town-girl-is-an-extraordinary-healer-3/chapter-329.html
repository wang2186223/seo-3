                <p>Verena gave a small nod before walking over to settle on a sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick moved swiftly, placing two cups of coffee neatly on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis broke the silence, his tone calm yet firm. &#34;You can go ahead and take care of your work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick inclined his head in acknowledgment, and then slipped out, gently pulling the door shut behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the room grew quiet, Luis crossed over as well and lowered himself onto the sofa opposite Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning forward, elbows braced on his knees and fingers interlocked, he asked steadily, &#34;Verena, has something happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew her nature well. Verena was not the type to stir the waters without cause; when she acted,it meant the stakes were high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips pressed into a thin line, her eyes carrying the weight of hesitation as she studied him. Sherwood, to her, was little more than a stranger without any bond of affection. Yet to Luis, Sherwood stood as a venerable elder who the Sampson family owed a debt of gratitude to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of trust had cemented Luis&#39; regard for him. For Verena to cast suspicion on Sherwood now was like tossing a stone into still water-it would be difficult for Luis to accept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the matter at hand touched upon the safety of the entire Sampson Group, and Luis could not be left in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking in a steady breath, Verena looked at him with solemn resolve. &#34;Luis, what I&#39;m about to say may overturn your view of Sherwood completely.You must be ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion flickered in Luis&#39; eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena paused, and then pressed on. &#34;I&#39;ve been digging into many things lately and discovered that Sherwood&#39;s gestures may hide deeper motives. Luis,have you ever considered that his generosity toward us might be nothing more than a carefully laid trap?That everything was meant to serve some hidden agenda?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis lifted the cup of coffee,but her words froze him in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The porcelain halted midway, his eyes sharpening as the calm surface gave way to keen vigilance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows knitted together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing the cup back down, he studied Verena closely,realizing there was no jest in her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held his silence for a long beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he spoke, his voice tinged with unease.&#34;Verena,could this be a misunderstanding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pause, and then he continued, &#34;Sherwood has done so much for our family. If what you say were true, then when you vanished and Sampson Group teetered on the edge of ruin, why would he step forward to help me rebuild?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, Verena was over six months into her pregnancy. The discomfort of sitting too long pressed on her, and she shifted, preparing to stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis rose to steady her, but she waved him off,pushing herself up. With one hand on her lower back,the other resting protectively on her rounded belly,she started pacing slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course he would step forward. Because the storm then was not truly fatal. It was a setback, not the end of the road. The real problem was that our father, consumed by grief, had no will to run the company.That opened the door for chaos. But think carefully,Luis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She halted suddenly, turning to meet his eyes head-on. &#34;If Sampson Group had truly been pushed to the brink, even in despair, Dad would have clenched his teeth and shouldered the responsibility for the sake of the family&#39;s legacy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena resumed pacing, her tone deliberate and measured. &#34;If I were Sherwood, I too would have intervened before a fatal collapse. By doing so, l&#39;d gain gratitude, secure trust, and position myself to rightfully insert influence into the company. Step by step,I could then consume it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved into a cold, ironic smile. &#34;And what&#39;s more-by helping in crisis, he avoids suspicion. No one questions a hand that rescues. He must have calculated that you, Luis, are a man who never forgets a grudge and always repays kindness. That&#39;s why he&#39;s managed to extend his reach into every corner of Sampson Group without resistance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis listened, his expression darkening like clouds before rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet years of walking both the straight road and shadowed alleys had taught him caution; he quickly reined in his emotions. Drawing a long breath, he steadied his tone. &#34;Verena,do you have evidence for this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As though anticipating the question, Verena remained composed. She returned to his side, reaching for the laptop she had brought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With practiced motion, she powered it on, sliding in a USB drive loaded with information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen glowed, casting a cold light across their faces,making the moment all the more grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These,&#34; she explained, pointing at the complex charts and figures, &#34;are the connections I&#39;ve uncovered regarding the investors who purchased Sampson Group&#39;s shares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was even, precise. &#34;Luis, you&#39;ve been rooted in Ochrerayd for years, with deep ties and broad resources. If you dig into this further, it will be far easier for you than it was for me, and your findings will cut deeper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened slightly, meeting his gaze with unshaken sincerity. &#34;If you doubt me, then investigate yourself. I&#39;m not showing you this to force belief, but to let you see who holds those shares and how their ties weave together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; lips pressed into a thin, firm line as his eyes scanned the tangled web displayed on the screen, a chill  settling in his gaze. Noticing it, Verena frowned faintly, worry flickering across her features. &#34;Though we lack ironclad proof of Sherwood&#39;s malice, caution is still the wiser course.The Sampson business empire is large and prosperous -such trees always draw the wind. We must keep our guard up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis let out a soft sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her with gentle warmth, his tone colored by brotherly affection. &#34;Verena, it isn&#39;t that I doubt you. You&#39;ve always had a clear head, and I respect that.But Sherwood has stood beside our family for so long-it&#39;s difficult to imagine he could be what you suggest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pause, and then he conceded, &#34;Still, you&#39;re right.The human heart is a riddle, and in business,vigilance is worth more than trust. Rest assured, I&#39;ll take this matter into my own hands and not let it drift away.From this moment on, I will keep a sharper eye on Sherwood.&#34;</p>
