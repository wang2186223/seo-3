                <p>After the check-up, Isaac and Verena returned to Seraphina Villas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they got out of the car, Verena carefully wheeled Isaac inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated in the chair, Isaac kept holding the medical report, reading it again and again as if it contained the secret of life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the way back, he had already told Verena he wouId not be going to work today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena hesitated for a beat, and then stopped in front of him to confirm, saying, &#34;Isaac, are you truly not going to the office? At the hospital, I noticed Jacob taking several calls that looked urgent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac clasped her hands, his deep eyes lit with a gentle smile. &#34;Nothing is as important as you are to me.Besides, I want to spend more time with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had long wished for an excuse to linger at home with her, and now, with the baby on the way, he had every reason to hold on tighter.	元</p>
                
                
                
                <p>4A small smile tugged at Verena&#39;s lips as she tilted her head and teased softly,&#34;Isaac, I never knew you could be so clingy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was light as a feather, her eyes tender, as though she were gazing not at a man of stature but at a boy unwilling to let go of his toy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac,caught off guard,showed a fleeting trace of awkwardness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena chuckled, and then quietly moved behind him to continue pushing him forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they entered the living room, they saw a dignified middle-aged woman seated gracefully on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the sound, Danica rose with a welcoming smile. &#34;Isaac, Verena, you&#39;re back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s smile vanished in an instant, and shadows of conflicting emotions stirred in his eyes. The memory of how Danica had once judged Verena unjustly, misled by Katelyn&#39;s poisoned words, burned within him. He replied in a tone that carried both distance and restraint, &#34;Mother, do you have something to tell me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not here for you.&#34; Danica lowered her gaze, guilt flickering across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned toward Verena, her voice low. &#34;I&#39;m here... to apologize to Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lifted again, filled with regret and sorrow. &#34;Verena, I was wrong. I should never have wronged you.l let Katelyn&#39;s lies cloud my judgment, and I made a grave mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remorse weighed heavily on her words. &#34;I even sided with outsiders and said cruel things to you, almost placing you in danger. Verena, can you forgive me? I truly know my fault. If you give me the chance, I will do my utmost to make amends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes brimmed with tears as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica was genuinely brokenhearted-not only for misjudging Verena but also because her choices had driven a wvedge between her and her son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had done it all in the name of Isaac&#39;s well-being, yet her efforts had cut both him and Verena deeply</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Verena could respond, Isaac spoke first, his voice firm before Danica. &#34;Verena, don&#39;t trouble yourself with my feelings. If you wish to forgive her, do so; if not, you needn&#39;t force yourself. I don&#39;t want you to compromise for my sake. She is my mother, my duty, and I&#39;ll carry that burden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s heart twisted with both sorrow and relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sorrow,because her son-whong she had always sought to protect-spoke to her now with such coldness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief, because she could finally see him breaking free of his silence, speaking his heart with clarity,something she had long wished for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s words warmed Verena deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, she bore no grudge against Danica; yet neither did she feel any great attachment. She understood that Danica&#39;s actions had sprung from a desperate love for her son, even if twisted by another&#39;s manipulation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And since Isaac always placed her above all, Verena wished, in return, to spare him from the bitter tug-of-war between wife and mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After collecting her thoughts, Verena pressed her lips together and spoke calmly.&#34;Danica, I&#39;ve heard your words, and I hope you hold fast to them. Take this as a lesson, and please refrain from interfering in Isaac&#39;s and my personal matters again. This is not just my stance but his as well. I can forgive you this time-but if such a thing repeats, I will have no choice but to keep my distance.&#34;</p>
