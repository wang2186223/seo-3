            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Years spent immersed in pharmacology had given Verena a foundation most doctors could only envy.Experience with rare and difficult cases, along with her unconventional methods, offered a glimmer of hope even when situations looked grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood studied Verena,searching her calm face for any hint of certainty. His voice trembled as he spoke.&#34;Verena, do you really think there&#39;s a chance for me to get better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chose her words carefully, keeping her confidence guarded. &#34;Liver cancer isn&#39;t easy to fight,Mr. Kirk, but there are ways to manage it. I&#39;ll do everything I can for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief flashed across Sherwood&#39;s features. &#34;Just hearing that from you helps me breathe a little easier.Thank you,Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded. &#34;We&#39;ll start with traditional treatment to help your energy flow and ease your discomfort. The needles might sting a bit, but try to stay relaxed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her kit, revealing rows of shining silver needles, each one meticulously arranged and ready. Though he tried to seem fearless, Sherwood couldn&#39;t stop staring at the needles, swallowing hard. &#34;I&#39;m ready. Go ahead.I trust you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was steady, but his hands twisted the hem of his shirt, betraying a deep-rooted anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trust, after all, was never something he handed out freely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena wiped each needle with care, her tone soothing. &#34;There&#39;s nothing to worry about. If you focus on a pleasant memory, the treatment will be over before you know it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands moved with swift precision, finding each acupuncture point with confidence. The needles glided into place, her expertise on full display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena recalled Isaac&#39;s warning from the night before about Sherwood&#39;s suspicious intentions, and a sharp glint of caution flickered in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the outside, she looked calm and steady, but underneath, she carried a quiet edge of caution-she didn&#39;t try to do her best for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This session was just the beginning, a way to gauge his condition, nothing more. A single round of acupuncture would only smooth the surface; the real problem ran deeper. Verena wasn&#39;t naive enough to save someone who posed a threat to her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She maintained a careful mask: all professionalism and poise, her real thoughts hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the final needle was removed, she cleaned her tools and returned them to their case with quiet efficiency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it for now, Mr. Kirk. Try to get plenty of rest,and if you notice anything out of the ordinary,let me know right away,&#34; said Verena, her voice gentle but firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood pushed himself upright with slow movements, gave a brief stretch, and a faint expression of relief settled across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m already feeling the difference,Verena. Thank you.&#34;His face softened into a smile as he made a gesture of hospitality. &#34;It&#39;s nearly lunchtime. Would youstay and join me? Let me show my appreciation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A polite smile flickered across Verena&#39;s face as she shook her head.&#34;That&#39;s very generous of you, Mr. Kirk,but I have a few pressing matters I can&#39;t put off.Maybe next time, after your next round of treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were gentle, yet there was no mistaking her resolve. Sherwood caught the unspoken finality and didn&#39;t push any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then. If you ever run into trouble, business or otherwise, my door&#39;s always open to you, Verena,&#34; he said,following her to the entryway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched as she walked away, his initial warmth dimming as her figure slipped out of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside,the sun beat down relentlessly. Raising a hand to shield her eyes, Verena hurried toward the waiting car by the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver wasted no time opening the door, and she slid into the cool interior, grateful for the reprieve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car pulled away from the Kirk family villa and onto the main road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning to her home in Shoildon, Verena dropped onto the living room sofa, sinking into the cushions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thoughts tumbled through her mind: Isaac&#39;s warning from the night before, and the man she&#39;d seen outside Sherwood&#39;s villa, both lingering at the edge of her memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Digging for the truth would take more than speculation.She needed real answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined, Verena grabbed her phone and dialed Luis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up on the first ring, his voice calm as ever.&#34;Hey, Verena. What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasted no time with pleasantries. &#34;Luis, I need you to pull the profiles for every executive and shareholder at. Sampson Group. I want their backgrounds, recent movements, and who they&#39;ve been meeting with. Don&#39;t leave anything out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis immediately picked up on the urgency in her tone.&#34;Is something wrong? Did you run into trouble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s gaze drifted to the garden outside, her brow furrowing. After a brief pause, she replied, &#34;I&#39;m not sure yet. Send me what you find first, and we&#39;ll talk once I&#39;ve gone over the details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis understood that Verena never acted without careful thought, and he was certain she would not press him with such urgent demands unless there was a solid reason behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chose not to press her with more questions and instead spoke firmly. &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll take care of it right now. As soon as everything is ready, I&#39;ll send the materials to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the call finished, Verena made her way upstairs and booted up her laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short while later, a notification chimed. Luis had already delivered the files.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she clicked open the documents,ready to dig into whatever secrets they held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Information and images filled the screen, each file unraveling the inner workings of the Sampson Group&#39;s leadership.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes moved swiftly, absorbing every name,background, and photograph with laser focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roughly thirty minutes passed before something unusual made her pause mid-scroll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A certain image jumped out at her, halting her hand in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There,frozen on the screen, was a man with a brown birthmark on his right cheek and heavy square glasses perched on his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition hit like a punch; she&#39;d seen this man earlier, crossing paths with him on the road leading to Sherwood&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp breath escaped her as she leaned closer,reading the caption beneath the photo. The name read Howe Adams, a major power broker at Sampson Group, holding a sizable share and clearly pulling more strings than most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization left her stunned, mind racing with questions. Her fingers drummed an anxious beat on the desktop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would someone like Howe be anywhere near Sherwood&#39;s home?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of arrangement could be brewing between them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way this was a chance encounter.Something bigger had to be unfolding beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe Howe was just one of the cogs in a much larger scheme.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to get answers, Verena picked up her phone and dialed her trusted detective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the third ring, a voice came through. &#34;Verena, how can I help you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena wasted no time. &#34;I need a full report on who&#39;s been snapping up Sampson Group&#39;s loose shares.I want names, transaction dates, and even where the deals went down. Don&#39;t leave anything out. This takes priority. Send me what you find as soon as possible.&#34;</p>
