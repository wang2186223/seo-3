                <p>Anger followed Katelyn through the front door. She moved briskly past the living room, her expression tight,while the butler stood silently aside and watched her take the stairs two at a time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of service had taught the butler exactly when to keep his distance. Reading her mood in an instant,he kept quiet and stayed out of her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she reached the upper floor, Katelyn threw open the door to a secluded room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half-shuttered curtains filled the space with a dull gray glow. Anyone who walked in would have mistaken the place for a backroom operating table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this was no clinic.Floor-to-ceiling shelves lined the walls, holding jar after jar of animal organs and oddities, making it a scientist&#39;s lab gone grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without sparing the shelves a glance, Katelyn snatched up a scalpel and dragged a trembling lab rat from a wire cage at her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed the rat down and cut into its side, making no effort to spare it pain-her anger finding an outlet in the violence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look in her eyes turned cold and vicious-a far cry from the graceful, polished woman she showed the world outside these walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over and over, she drove the scalpel into the helpless animal, twisting what should have been a tool for saving lives into something brutal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weak squeals broke from the rat as it thrashed, the sounds fading fast in the wide, echoing room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn barely registered the noise. Her stare was empty while she muttered again and again, &#34;You think you can take what belongs to me? How dare you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each angry whisper brought Verena&#39;s face into focus in her mind. She pictured the blade cutting into her rival, not just the animal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Revenge simmered in her thoughts. She wanted to see Verena suffer, inch by inch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the rat&#39;s strength faded, it gave one last desperate kick and raked its claws across Katelyn&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain shot through her, snapping her out of her haze. She gasped for breath and lifted her arm high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A final shrill squeak pierced the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, the rat&#39;s limp body slid from the table, leaving the room in sudden, utter silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; A sharp cry rang out from the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia froze in place, covering her mouth with her hand as she stared in shock at the blood smeared across Katelyn&#39;s fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn turned at the noise and asked coldly, &#34;How much did you see?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... just walked in,&#34; Kaia stammered, lowering her hand and trying not to gag from the metallic scent of blood. &#34;I heard your heels on the stairs, so I knew you were home. When I couldn&#39;t find you, I saw this door open and thought I&#39;d look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn gave a short nod. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A note of worry crept into Kaia&#39;s voice. &#34;Did something happen to make you this upset?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing&#39;s wrong,&#34; said Katelyn, brushing her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn flashed a smile that looked too smooth, and for a second, Kaia wondered if she had imnagined the earlier flash of anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding up her stained hand, Katelyn explained, &#34;I was prepping for an experiment, but this rat went wild and tried to bite me. My professor in college always said, &#39;If a specimen attacks, you put it down right away.Did I startle you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course,Katelyn was lying. There was no way she&#39;d let Kaia know she was really lashing out over Verena. Kaia had never come across such a principle during her studies, but since it came from her idol, she was ready to accept it without question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying not to look at the mess, Kaia swallowed her disgust and forced a weak smile. &#34;No, I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll handle this,&#34; Katelyn said quietly. &#34;Go on back to your room. I&#39;ll stop by in a bit to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia nodded and hurried away, doing her best not to throw up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little while later, Katelyn showed up at Kaia&#39;s door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding onto the bed next to Kaia, Katelyn put on a gentle smile. &#34;So, how are you feeling now? Any better?&#34;After leaving Willis Villa, Kaia got caught in a downpour. The cold she picked up from that night had lingered for weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia, surprised by Kat nearly over it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what I wanted the next step for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right away, Kaia caugh</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Katelyn nodded,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn arched a brow forgiveness. If they as past mistakes, anything</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning home felt lik been a rash decision. D</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of silen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia started to get up, b	elyn&#39;s sudden concern, nodded eagerly. &#34;Yeah, I&#39;ve been taking my meds and I&#39;m</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to hear.&#34; Katelyn squeezed her hand,locking eyes with her. &#34;Listen, I need you to take t her meaning, her face lighting up. &#34;Is it time for us to finally start our revenge?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s excitement grew. &#34;What&#39;s the plan? Just say it, I&#39;ll handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>, a sly grin forming. &#34;First, you&#39;ve got to go home and beg your parents for k, make it sound like you went through hell-say you were in danger, you realize your . Play the part, cry if you have to, but make sure they forgive you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>e admitting defeat, but Kaia knew she couldn&#39;t avoid her family forever. Leaving had eep down, she worried Alec and Laura might turn their backs on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ce, Kaia nodded. &#34;Alright; I&#39;ll do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ut Katelyn caught her by the arm. &#34;Wait, that&#39;s not all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, Kaia glanced back. &#34;What do you mean?&#34; A chill flashed in Katelyn&#39;s eyes. &#34;You&#39;re going to visit Verena, too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Verena, Kaia stiffened, eyes narrowing. &#34;Why/should I bother facing her? You just want to give her a chance to make fun of mne?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn kept her voice steady. &#34;Relax. Listen to what I&#39;m saying. Go apologize for everything that&#39;s happened and see if you can patch things up with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia let her frustration show. &#34;We can&#39;t even get through a basic conversation without fighting. How am I supposed to make friends with her? Can&#39;t we try something else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp look flashed across Katelyn&#39;s face. &#34;Do you really not get it? Winning her trust is the only way we&#39;ll get the upper hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s shoulders dropped as she mulled it over. &#34;She&#39;s smart, you know. There&#39;s no way she&#39;d just fall for it and trust me that easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly grin spread on Katelyn&#39;s lips. &#34;That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m hoping for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion pulled Kaia&#39;s brows together. &#34;What are you getting at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s tone turned playful. &#34;Go to Verena and play the victim. Make sure there are people watching, too.If you beg for forgiveness and she brushes you off, everyone else will think she&#39;s the unreasonable one. Her image will take the hit, not yours. Danica might not step into every squabble, but she&#39;s big on fairness. Once word gets around, she&#39;ll see things my way and back me up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her gaze to the window, Katelyn&#39;s lips curled in a satisfied smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew all too well that the Bennett family had strict expectations. In a family like theirs, a daughter-in-law tainted by even a hint of scandal would never be welcome.</p>
