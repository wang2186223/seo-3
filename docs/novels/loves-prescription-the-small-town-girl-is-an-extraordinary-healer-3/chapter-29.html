                <p>Laura glared at Verena, ready to lash out, but Isaac spoke up first. He nodded and said quietly, &#34;She&#39;s right. Honestly, I do feel lucky to be marrying Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura could only stare at him, completely thrown off by his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia also turned to look at lsaac, unable to hide her shock. There was even a small, amused smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither Verena nor Isaac lingered at the house. They said their goodbyes and headed out together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside the car, Verena looked over at Isaac. She was practically glowing, her eyes full of curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, Isaac pretended to focus on the scenery outside, but eventually, he couldn&#39;t ignore her gaze any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally turned and asked, &#34;What&#39;s with that look?Why are you staring at me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That seemed to snap Verena out of it. She blinked and said,&#34;Oh. I just wanted to know if you meant what you said back there.&#34; Isaac gave a slight frown. &#34;Which part are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All of it,&#34; she replied, her tone playful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In reality, he had only spoken a couple of sentences,but the meaning behind them lingered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac fell quiet, Verena pressed her hands into the seat and leaned a little closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were both sitting in the back, and Isaac&#39;s height made him look even more imposing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he noticed her moving closer,he instinctively leaned away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena wasn&#39;t going to let him get away that easily.She looked up at him, grinning. &#34;Weren&#39;t you supposed to send someone to pick me up? What made you decide to come in person?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had sent her a message last night saying the driver would be there in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had assumed it would be just the chauffeur.She hadn&#39;t expected him to show up too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac really meant to let the driver handle it and meet her at the bridal shop. But when the driver was ready to pull away this morning, he changed his mind on a whim and got in, not bothering to think too hard about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| was just passing by and thought we could go to the bridal shop together,&#34; he said, pretending it meant nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; Verena blurted out, dragging the word slowly though her tone made it clear she didn&#39;t believe a word of it. The Bennett Mansion and the Willis Villa were nowhere near each other, and only someone completely clueless would buy his excuse. If he had gone out of his way to come for her, could it mean that feelings he didn&#39;t remember were starting to rise back to the surface without him even noticing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought made Verena&#39;s smile grow a little wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat up straighter, and then closed her eyes,settling back as if she wanted to rest for the ride.Isaac noticed her quiet confidence and almost asked if she still doubted his motives. For a moment, he wanted to clear things up, but then he thought better of it. Even if she questioned him, he honestly did not know how to explain his own actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their car rolled to a stop not long after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thick winter fog drifted over the streets, making the whole morning feel soft andstill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac waited in his wheelchair while his assistant moved to help, but Verena stepped forward and placed her hands on the chair&#39;s handles. &#34;I&#39;ll take care of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant hesitated, glancing at Isaac for direction.Isaac gave a small nod, so he simply followed behind,watching the two of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the bridal shop, a team of staff members stood by the door, ready to greet them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Verena pushed Isaac inside, the staff all bowed politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth filled the space, and bright lights danced across glass cases, making every wedding dress look even more dazzling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A young sales assistant stepped forward, her smile directed at Isaac. &#34;Good morning, Mr. Bennett.&#34; Then she turned to Verena, her eyes lighting up.&#34;And this must be Mrs. Bennett. She&#39;s absolutely stunning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Isaac hesitated at the name. Mrs.Bennett?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He almost corrected the assistant, wanting to explain they weren&#39;t married just yet, but Verena only gave a small, polite smile. &#34;Thank you,&#34; she said, her voice gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac glanced over and noticed her smile. It was warm and sincere, and she did not seem at all bothered by being called Mrs. Bennett.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac didn&#39;t reply, the sales assistant quickly added, &#34;Mr. Bennett, would you like to see our wedding dress styles? | can-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac cut her off, his tone even. &#34;I&#39;m not particular.Your job is to help Mrs. Bennett with anything she needs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena arched her eyebrow in silent amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sales assistant forced a quick smile, and then nodded.&#34;Yes,absolutely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena took her time looking through the racks and picked out several wedding dresses. Meanwhile, the sales assistant chose a few matching suits for lsaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Verena settled on an off-the-shoulder gown with a flowing train. The back was laced with smooth white ribbons that needed to be tied. Right then, the sales assistant left to find a suit for lsaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she finished changing, Verena pulled the curtain aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft sound caught Isaac&#39;s attention. He glanced up and stopped short, unable to look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There stood Verena, her long hair pinned up with care, and the pale dress brought out the soft glow of her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wore only a touch of makeup, but it gave her cool, elegant features an unmistakable charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac just stared at her in silence, Verena grinned and called out, &#34;Are you so dazzled you forgot how to speak?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook himself from his thoughts and cleared his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile widened.She had always known how shy he could be. &#34;Come help me out,&#34; she remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking too much, Isaac rolled his chair over to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he reached her, Verena turned away, tilted her head back, and said, &#34;I can&#39;t tie up the back of this dress. Give me a hand, will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make it easier, Verena bent her knees and lowered herself a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac glanced down and took in the graceful lines of her shoulders. Her back was smooth and delicate,and a tiny black mole on her left shoulder blade caught his eye, making her look even more intriguing-and somehow oddly familiar. For a moment, Isaac froze. Verena noticed and reached back, placing the ribbons directly into his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She teased him gently,Ir. Bennett, are you going to help or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That snapped him out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started working on the ribbons, but his fingers were awkward and cool as they brushed against her bare skin. The heat from her back sent a shock through him,and he immediately pulled his hand away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fumbled for words. &#34;I, um, maybe the sales assistant should do this part.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He backed his wheelchair away, suddenly too nervous to meet her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him pull away so quickly, Verena suddenly remembered how she once told him to stop shutting her out. He had promised her back then. Yet here he was,doing the same thing all over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened and spoke in a quiet voice. &#34;You&#39;re such a liar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she barely spoke above a whisper,Isaac still caught what she said. His gaze dropped, fixated on his unmoving legs. He found himself spiraling, thinking about how she&#39;d let him touch her just now. The problem wasn&#39;t her, and deep down, he knew it. For someone like him, feeling broken and less than whole, there were certain things he would always feel were out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Experience had taught him that nothing in life comes for free, and he couldn&#39;t fool himself into believing this marriage was about love. Since she never voiced any complaints, there had to be something else she wanted-and that wasn&#39;t him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of Isaac&#39;s brooding silence left Verena with a heavy heart. It was easy to see how much pain he was hiding, and she understood it would take time before he&#39;d be himself again. Pushing him for more wouldn&#39;t help either of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile found its way onto her face as she spoke. &#34;I&#39;ll just wait for the assistant, then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac looked over, surprised to find only kindness and understanding in her eyes. There was no hint of annoyance about his refusal, just a warmth that made himn feel oddly forgiven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Verena standing there so at ease, lsaac grew restless, unsure whether he was allowed to reach for what he wanted-almost like a child who didn&#39;t know if he was allowed a treat. It surprised him how deeply she&#39;d managed to get under his skin, considering how little time they&#39;d known each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t help watching her for a moment longer,and then looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Verena broke the silence. &#34;But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s head snapped up at the sound of her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing the curtain, Verena caught his eye. Mischief sparkled in her gaze as she spoke with quiet conviction. &#34;You said you wouldn&#39;t shut me out. I&#39;ll let you off the hook for now, but next time, you better remember your promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Isaac could think of a reply, she slipped behind the bright white curtain, the fabric falling quietly in her wake.</p>
