                <p>With a quiet sigh, Fletcher guessed aloud. &#34;Maybe Isaac is unhappy with his fiancée and feels powerless in this marriage arrangement. He could be using this as a chance to push the Willis family into canceling the engagement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having watched Isaac grow from a boy into a man,Barrie wore a grave expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At such a young age, Isaac had already lost his ability to walk and was now bound to a marriage with a woman he despised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only did Isaac feel burdened, but the entire Lyons family pitied his situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fletcher voiced his doubt next. &#34;Alec needs to be sharper. Doesn&#39;t he check into relationships before seeking favors? Why would we interfere with someone Isaac is trying to deal with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a short pause, he added, &#34;Still, Alec isn&#39;t stupid.He rose to fortune almost overnight and built Willis Group into what it is today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following a moment of thought, Barrie said to the butler, &#34;Get in touch with the Willis family and learn what you can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler answered with respect, and then went off to search for the Willis family&#39;s number and place the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the Willis Villa, Laura looked over at the wall clock. &#34;It&#39;s already nine o&#39;clock, and we still haven&#39;t heard back. Do you think Barrie is avoiding the trouble because he doesn&#39;t want to return the favor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec answered in a low, firm tone, &#34;Nonsense! Barrie is known all over Shoildon for his integrity. You think everyone stoops to your way of thinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as he mocked her, his eyes flicked to the clock,and his fists tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cup of coffee in front of him sat untouched,long since grown cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully, unease was gnawing at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His train of thought broke off when the landline suddenly rang</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec and Laura froze in surprise, and then rushed toward the ornate round table to answer the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen displayed no name at all, only a short string of numbers. When Alec answered the call, he spoke cautiously.&#34;Hello, Alec Willis speaking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, an aged, gravelly voice replied,&#34;Good morning, Mr. Willis. This is Morris Fowler, the butler of MMr. Barrie Lyons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Alec looked over at Laura, and the nervous tension weighing on them both immediately lifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec answered warmly,, Mr. Fowler, I&#39;ve heard of you. You&#39;ve been with Mr. Lyons since your youth,skilled in so many things, and still impressive even in your sixties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The praise flowed easily, masking Alec&#39;s eagerness beneath a layer of flattery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s very kind of you, Mr. Willis.&#34; Morris, long used to such words, skipped over them and asked directly,&#34;Mr. Lyons has seen your letter. What is the matter you wish to discuss with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura, standing beside Alec, gave his elbow a small nudge, urging him to bring up the request without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Alec understood that men like Barrie had no patience for empty pleas without proper justification.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,he chose to lean on sentiment and bring up Kaia&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing too serious,&#34; Alec said with a gentle smile and a note of concern. &#34;I only wished to ask how Mr.Lyons&#39; injured leg is doing. The weather is cold now,and he ought to take care of his health.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morris knitted his brows, puzzled by Alec&#39;s sudden concern over Barrie&#39;s condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Alec let out a regretful sigh. &#34;If I had realized sooner that my daughter could heal Mr.Lyons &#39; leg, I would have sent her years ago and spared him all that needless suffering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, Alec twisted the truth, fully aware that Kaia had not been capable of such work at the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That detail hardly mattered now. What counted was that he sounded sincere and that Morris remembered it was his daughter who had brought recovery to Barrie&#39;s leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, the Lyons family remained indebted to the Willis family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, Morris wasted no time and stepped quickly outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Morris repeated Alec&#39;s message, Barrie grew quiet, lost in thought as he  considered the possibility.Dr.Willis had chosen to remain somewhat anonymous, revealing only her family name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Moris put forward a new idea. &#34;That physician shared the surname Willis. Is it possible she&#39;s Alec&#39;s daughter, Mr. Lyons?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrie&#39;s eyes brightened with understanding,his jaw slackening a bit. &#34;My recovery hasn&#39;t been publicized.If this information reached them, there&#39;s a great chance Dr. Willis is Alec&#39;s daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning his focus to Fletcher, he asked, &#34;Can you tell me how many girls are in the Willis family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowledgeable about the household, Fletcher answered without hesitation, &#34;They have two daughters. The older one is Isaac&#39;s fiancée. She grew up out in the countryside and reportedly didn&#39;t finish her last year of high school. The younger daughter is studying medicine and is said to be quite skilled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confirmation dawned on Barrie, and he smacked the table with a burst of excitement. &#34;There it is! If the younger daughter&#39;s studying medicine, she must be Dr.Willis who healed my leg.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined, Barrie continued, &#34;If Alec&#39;s daughter is the doctor who treated me, I owe her more than I can say. The Willis family deserves my help with their club problems-even if lsaac objects. Now, help me up!&#34;Bracing himself with his cane, he insisted, &#34;I want to speak to the Willis family myself. Take me inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shared enthusiasm was clear as Fletcher quickly guided Barrie indoors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over at the Willis Villa, Alec felt surprised to hear the Lyons family calling back so soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he answered, an exuberant voice from the other end cut in before he could introduce himself.&#34;Mr. Willis, I owe you thanks. You&#39;ve raised a remarkable and considerate daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though pride was unmistakable, Alec managed a humble reply. &#34;Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Lyons.She certainly has a mischievous side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barrie responded warmly, &#34;Don&#39;t sell her short, Mr.Willis. Your daughter is exceptionally well-mannered.It&#39;s a shame my grandson isn&#39;t good enough for her.Otherwise, it would be an honor if she joined my family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Alec heard Barrie&#39;s wish, he remained cautious about reading too much into it, focusing instead on the business at hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Alec, the business matter came first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec had only just begun to bring up the issue with the club when Barrie&#39;s strong voice interrupted him. &#34;I&#39;m aware of the problems regarding your club. Give me some time,and I&#39;ll take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gratitude spread across Alec&#39;s features. &#34;Your support means everything, Mr. Lyons. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Barrie added, &#34;Will you be available the day after tomorrow? If so, myfamily and I would like to pay a visit and show our appreciation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura nearly let out a cheer, unable to contain her happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having one of Shoildon&#39;s most respected families come to visit would lift the Willis family&#39;s status to a new level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matching Laura&#39;s excitement, Alec nodded again and again, taking a deep breath to calm himself. &#34;You are always welcome, Mr. Lyons. It&#39;s an honor for our family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone call left Alec and Laura practically bursting with excitement, their energy lasting until Kaia finally returned from school later that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she stepped inside, Laura hurried over,cradled Kaia&#39;s cheeks, and planted a kiss on her forehead.&#34;You really are a wonderful daughter, Kaia.Every bit of love I&#39;ve ever given you was worth it.&#34;</p>
