                <p>After completing Maxton&#39;s medical examination,Verena carefully set aside the instruments and offered him a reassuring smile. &#34;Your condition has improved remarkably, and there are no abnormalities in your body. You may leave this ward whenever you wish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maxton, who had weathered the storms of the business world for most of his life, had the great perceptiveness for detecting the faintest shifts in the air around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he first opened his eyes, he noticed only his eldest son Tobin by his side. His younger son, Erick,was nowhere in sight, and the absence stirred unease in his heart. At the time, however, weakness chained his tongue, leaving him unable to ask questions. Now that strength had returned, those questions pressed forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suspected Verena, who had witnessed much,might hold the answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning toward her, he asked with quiet gravity,&#34;Evelyn, during my coma, did anything happen that l should know about?&#34; Faced with his inquiry, Verena chose not to conceal the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a seat nearby, composed herself, and began slowly, &#34;I suppose it&#39;s only a matter of time before you discover this. So,allow me to speak plainly...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then explained how Erick had obstructed Tobin&#39;s attempts to find doctors for him,how she had been forced to pose as Tobin&#39;s girlfriend to deceive Erick,and how, once the truth came to light, Erick had threatened the lives of all three of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maxton listened, and though his face remained calm,his heart tightened. He had always known Erick to be ambitious, bold to the point of recklessness, and scheming far beyond his years. That was precisely why he had hesitated to hand the company reins to him.Tobin&#39;s steady hand could steady storms; Erick&#39;s temper was a fire that could consume alL.Yet,never had he imagined his own son would cross such ruthless lines. Even the simplest of creatures knew to honor their parents-yet Erick...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revelation left Maxton disheartened, though anger simmered beneath. Still, in front of Verena-the savior who had brought him back from death&#39;s door -he swallowed his fury and instead managed a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never thought matters had taken so many twists and turns, nor that Erick would go so far as to hunt you  down. It is truly my failure as a father. For the trouble you&#39;ve endured, I owe you an apology.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Treating patients is my duty,&#34; Verena replied softly.&#34;Yet because of all this, my family has been unfairly dragged through the mud by public opinion. So I must humbly ask that you and Tobin stand forward and clarify the truth before the media.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before falling into a coma, Maxton had believed he might never wake again. Thus, his survival felt like borrowed time, a second life gifted to him. Having valued his life before, he now cherished it all the more.To him, Verena was no less than the hand that pulled him from the abyss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded at once, his gray brows lifting with fervor,his tone ringing with determination. &#34;Rest assured, I will give you my full support. Not only will I explain everything clearly to the public, but I will also see to it that you return home crowned with honor, so those who gossiped dare not utter another word.I want them to recognize your worth, to admire you, to respect you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena chuckled softly, thinking he might be overdoing it. Just as she was about to gently decline,Maxton raised his voice toward the door.&#34;Tobin, bring in the most reputable, truth-seeking reporters in Clokron for an interview.&#34; Tobin entered then,looking weary, as if he had rushed in after tending to endless tasks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, he had just wrapped up arrangements-yesterday he had instructed his assistant to contact reporters, and today he brought them over, briefing them thoroughly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing from the servants that Verena had finished examining his father, he hurried back to the ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing by the bed, Tobin spoke respectfully.&#34;Father, everything has been arranged. The reporters are ready. Whenever you wish, we can begin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the formal interview began,Maxton repeatedly urged Tobin to ensure the media&#39;s questions emphasized Verena&#39;s exceptional skill, encouraging them to ask more in that direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words overflowed with praise, almost lifting her onto a pedestal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening at the side, Verena grew slightly uneasy.Smiling faintly, she interjected, &#34;Maxton, I understand your gratitude, but isn&#39;t this a bit exaggerated?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exaggerated?&#34; Maxton countered with a hearty laugh,stroking his beard with pride. &#34;This is not exaggeration  but truth. I lay in illness for over half a year,and not one physician could help me. Yet you came, and in a matter of days, you cured me. Tell me, is that not something worthy of boasting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin nodded in full agreement, his smile warm.Noticing Verena&#39;s continued modesty, he gave her shoulder a light pat. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Evelyn. We&#39;ll keep it balanced-there&#39;s no danger of us going overboard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile deepened the creases at the corners of Tobin&#39;s eyes, reflecting his lifted spirits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena pressed her lips together and nodded quietly.She only hoped they would indeed stay within bounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The interview was arranged in the grand hall of the Fairclough estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the doors opened, reporters were already gathered, cameras raised, lenses flashing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Tobin supporting him, Maxton walked slowly along the carpet toward the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of shutters echoed continuously as Maxton&#39;s figure appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters, nearly restless with anticipation,seemed ready to rush forward with questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin cleared his throat and began the opening  remarks.&#34;Ladies and gentlemen,Iam Tobin Fairclough,General Manager of Smoothdeed Group. Half a year ago, my father suddenly fell gravely ill. Though countless renowned doctors tried, his condition remained hopeless.Yet fate took a turn-or rather,my father&#39;s fortune did-for just days ago, Evelyn Rowe arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here he paused, glancing at Maxton, his eyes shining with sincerity. &#34;Under her treatment, everything changed. My father is not only cured but fully recovered in every respect. I know you all have many questions. Please, feel free to ask, and my father and I will answer as best we can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters froze in disbelief. Evelyn Rowe? Did Tobin just say Evelyn Rowe? The Evelyn who had solved countless medical mysteries in Clokron?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been invited merely to interview the chairman of Smoothdeed Group about his recovery and the company&#39;s future. They never imagined stumbling upon such a bombshell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Evelyn was not a business magnate,her name alone carried weight-an enigma, a healer whose hands had worked miracles time and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Evelyn&#39;s name was mentioned, the reporters surged forward like a tide, crowding around Tobin and Maxton, microphones and cameras in hand. The real treasure was Evelyn&#39;s story, and they were determined to unearth every detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room erupted into chaos, questions hurled all at once,leaving neither Maxton nor Tobin able to catch a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maxton raised his hand, gesturing for silence.&#34;Everyone, I understand your eagerness. But let&#39;s proceed one at a time. All questions will be answered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Order was restored.Maxton gestured toward the left side. &#34;We&#39;ll begin with the reporter on the left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chosen reporter asked quickly, &#34;Mr. Maxton Fairclough, is this Evelyn Rowe the internationally renowned healer people speak of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same thought burned in every reporter&#39;s mind,and all eyes fixed on Maxton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded with a smile. &#34;Yes, it is indeed her. I believe only she could possess such remarkable skill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this, the room stirred with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn&#39;s name alone could ripple through every circle,and now she stood tied to Maxton-it was a storm waiting to break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another reporter pressed on, &#34;Mr. Fairclough, your  confidence in Evelyn&#39;s medical ability seems absolute.Should we take this as you regarding her as your savior?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question was clearly one Tobin had arranged, for such personal wording rarely arose otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maxton laughed aloud and replied, &#34;It is not blind faith -it is earned faith! She proved her worth by curing me.Otherwise,would I be standing here, answering your questions with such vigor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice rose, ringing clear. &#34;Furthermore, I, Maxton Fairclough, believe in repaying grace with loyalty.Evelyn saved my life. She is not only my savior but also an important friend to the entire Fairclough family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A third reporter asked sharply, &#34;Are you implying, then,that the Fairclough family is openly backing Evelyn to the outside world?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question hung heavy, and silence filled the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly,this too had been prepared by Tobin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maxton&#39;s answer came firm and unyielding. &#34;This is not implication-it is declaration. Let me take this moment to state it plainly: No one will dare to disrespect Evelyn. Whoever dares provoke her will face the united strength of the Fairclough family.For to challenge her is to declare war on us.&#34; His words struck like a gavel, final and thunderous.The reporters&#39; shutters clicked wildly, eager not to miss the climax of the day.</p>
