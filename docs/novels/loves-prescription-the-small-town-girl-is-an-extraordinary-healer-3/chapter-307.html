                <p>&#34;I hope I&#39;m not too late for the celebration, Luis. Still a spot for me at the table?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The party was about to begin when a deep, friendly voice echoed from the entrance,commanding the attention of everyone in the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena glanced up and spotted a distinguished man stepping inside. He carried himself with a warmth that immediately put people at ease, his genial smile inviting rather than imposing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though time had etched gentle lines across his brow and his frame had softened, there was nothing weary in his manner. His presence was approachable, even reassuring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dark gray suit jacket,expertly tailored, draped over his shoulders with effortless elegance. A silk tie in midnight blue brought a quiet dignity to his appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sight of Sherwood Kirk, Luis moved to greet him,posture straight and respectful. &#34;Mr. Kirk, don&#39;t be modest. This evening wouldn&#39;t be complete without you.&#34; Sherwood chuckled, his laughter booming as he clapped Luis on the shoulder in a familiar, almost fatherly gesture. &#34;Always so earnest, Luis. I was only teasing. Got held up getting back, but I made sure to come straight here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his eyes softened with concern. &#34;It&#39;s been ages since I saw your father.How are your parents these days? At our age,health is everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis dipped his head in gratitude. &#34;Thank you for asking. They&#39;re both improving,thankfully.And you-you&#39;re always so busy. Be sure to take care of yourself,too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena watched the middle-aged man with quiet interest,her thoughts swirling beneath a calm exterior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the evening&#39;s guests had filed in with the same measured politeness-each stopping to offer Luis a greeting that was all surface and formality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment Mr. Kirk arrived, the atmosphere shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis stepped forward personally to welcome him,his tone carrying genuine respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Kirk greeted Luis with a tone that belonged to family, not formality-there was warmth in his voice,like an old friend slipping back into a cherished routine.Instead of the usual polite distance, Mr. Kirk genuinely inquired about her parents, his concern warm and unforced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their conversation felt nothing like small talk. It was rich with the ease and depth of people reuniting after too long apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear to Verena that Mr. Kirk and her parents were bound by years of shared stories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casting a fond look at his waistline, Sherwood gave his belly a playful pat and let out a good-natured laugh. &#34;I swear, two months in the countryside and all I&#39;ve got to show for it is a bigger belly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis drew a breath to tease him, but a melodic,teasing voice beat him to it. &#34;You&#39;re the only one surprised,Dad!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena turned in time to see a young woman approaching, her pink off-the-shoulder dress fluttering as she walked, heels tapping out a gentle rhythm on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was wisdom behind her youthful features-a quiet poise that softened her glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly Kirk, Sherwood&#39;s daughter, came to a stop beside them and fixed her father with a mock-scowl.&#34;I leave for one minute and you&#39;ve already ditched me? That&#39;s just cruel!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her full attention to Luis, Molly let the rest of the world fade into the background. &#34;You have no idea how amazing the desserts are in Starshell these days. Every time I visit, I can&#39;t help but sample everything. Honestly, I think I&#39;ve gained a few pounds just from all the taste-testing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a teasing glimmer, she pressed a finger to her cheek, as if to prove her point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis remained unflappable, his expression cool and composed,returning only the faintest of polite smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly,undeterred,leaned in with renewed brightness.&#34;Actually, I stumbled on a little dessertplace tucked away in Starshell-absolutely heavenly. I should take you there next time. You&#39;d love it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes danced as she gently reached for his arm,every move overflowing with clear affection and intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood could only laugh, shaking his head. &#34;You were gone so long, I just figured I&#39;d catch up with Luis while I waited.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced from his daughter to Luis, a thoughtful flicker in his eyes,but said nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis subtly shifted, putting a careful distance between  them.His tone stayed measured and formal. &#34;Miss Kirk,that&#39;s kind of you, but I&#39;ve been buried in work. You should enjoy those treats yourself-I wouldn&#39;t want to slow you down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s smile faltered for a split second, the bright confidence dimming just before she gathered herself,swallowing her disappointment behind another graceful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis gave no sign he&#39;d noticed Molly&#39;s disappointment.With quiet composure, he shifted beside Verena,his hand gently guiding her forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Kirk,allow me to introduce my sister, Verena,&#34; he said,his voice carrying pride and a hint of relief. &#34;She&#39;s endured more than most,but at last, she&#39;s home again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Verena, offering a warm smile. &#34;Verena,this is Sherwood Kirk-one of our father&#39;s oldest friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice lowered as he continued, &#34;While you were gone,everything changed. Home never felt the same.Mom was broken by grief. Dad wore himself out searching for you, looking after her, and never truly recovered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; eyes softened with emotion as he glanced back at Sherwood. &#34;During those years, when it felt like everything was falling apart, Mr. Kirk stood by us.He  taught me the ropes, helped me weather the business storms, and reminded me how to keep the family from crumbling. Without his support, I honestly don&#39;t know where we&#39;d be. Our family owes him more than we could ever repay.&#34;</p>
