                <p>Verena realized that if she shut her eyes and opened them again after a while, her confidence would steady her hands, and the nerves would fade away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that sense of control lasted just long enough for simpler operations. She quickly realized she needed far more experience to handle complex procedures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to improve, Verena dove into one surgical practice after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Progress came with every attempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By sticking to her rigorous daily routine, she became certain that soon she would be ready to operate on Isaac herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The possibility filled her with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As twilight settled over the house and Isaac wheeled himself through the door, Verena hurried to share the good news with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking into her eyes, Isaac caught the glow of her happiness, and a gentle warmth spread through his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was fully aware of the dedication Verena poured into overcoming her trembling hands, driven by her determination to be the one who could help him heal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda had told himn many times how Verena would lose herself in surgical practice for hours, sometimes working right through meals. At night, Isaac often found her surrounded by medical books at her desk,studying late into the evening before finally resting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since their wedding, she seemed to have grown a little thinner, proof of just how committed she was to his recovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought tugged at Isaac&#39;s heart. He reached out and brushed her cheek softly. &#34;I owe you so much,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena. I&#39;m grateful, and I&#39;m sorry for making you carry this burden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena placed her hand on his. &#34;You don&#39;t need to thank me, not in this house. We promised to stay together through everything. If you keep making it sound like we&#39;re strangers, I&#39;ll start to get upset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes softened at her words, and he instinctively took her hand, pressing a gentle kiss to her skin.His reply was calm and full of affection. &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll do as you say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle, satisfied smile, Verena asked, &#34;Would you like me to help you upstairs for your treatment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gave a small nod, and Verena carefully wheeled him into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they reached the second floor, she guided him into the medical room without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The approach to the treatment remained unchanged from before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Isaac slipped off the last piece of his dark gray boxer briefs, Verena carefully spread the prepared liquid medicine across his abdomen and waited for it to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat in the chair at his bedside, notebook and pen in hand, poised to track even the slightest change in his condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, the liquid medicine started to take effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint ache spread through Isaac&#39;s legs, accompanied by an intense heat building in his lower groin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clenching his jaw, he bent forward, sweat gathering on his brow and sliding down his sharp jawline to pool on his firm stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena kept a close watch, documenting every shift she noticed in his body, especially the visible changes in his lower region. She made sure to note the time and wrote detailed observations in her notebook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking over her earlier notes, she quickly realized that tonight&#39;s progress was more significant than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Verena&#39;s gaze fixed on the notebook, her expression distant, Isaac grew uneasy and asked, &#34;What is it? Is my condition not getting better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulled from her thoughts, Verena lifted her gaze to Isaac, a bright smile spreading across her face. &#34;I have good news. I compared the notes with your earlier records, and it turns out you&#39;ve already made significant progress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Isaac could only stare, his surprise plain on his face. &#34;You mean it? Are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A playful spark danced in Verena&#39;s eyes. &#34;What, you think I&#39;d make that up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was quick to shake his head. &#34;No, it&#39;s not that. I trust you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice dropped, softer now. &#34;It&#39;s myself I have trouble trusting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The countless failed treatments and disappointing doctor visits had left their scars.</p>
