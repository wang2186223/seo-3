                <p>Arriving at the Kirk family&#39;s estate, Verena got out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An elderly man in a crisp, dark uniform moved forward with a warm, respectful smile and nodded. &#34;Please come in, Mrs. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped inside, taking in the understated elegance of the living room. The same senior servant soon returned and set down a delicate cup of coffee in front of her, filling the room with its inviting aroma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Kirk is still upstairs getting ready. Please sit and make yourself comfortable while you wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena flashed him a grateful smile, and then picked up the cup, savoring the first sip before sinking onto the plush sofa. She reached into her bag for her phone,glancing down as she began to reply to work messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing that she was busy, the servant quietly slipped away and left her in peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shrill voice suddenly echoed through the hallway, shattering the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s head snapped up, startled, as a black-and-white Border Collie shot toward her, darting down the corridor with wild energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dog&#39;s fur glistened with good health, and his eyes sparkled with curiosity. Clamped in his mouth, a small object bounced with every step as he raced ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena rose from the sofa, blinking as she tried to process what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Border Collie screeched to a halt right at her feet,his front end crouched low, back end wiggling,tongue lolling out as he panted. His gaze flicked behind Verena, practically begging to bolt past her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harry,settle down!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shout came from down the hall as the young man in charge of walking the dog hurried into view. His cheeks were flushed, and his hair was sticking up in odd directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, he lunged and caught the leash, gripping it with both hands as he pulled the eager pup back under control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No amount of tugging could persuade the Border Collie to give up the fight. He dug his paws into the carpet, a deep growl rumbling from his chest, dead set on winning this battle of wills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant clung to the leash, struggling for control.Sweat gathered at his temples as he shot Verena an embarrassed look. &#34;Ma&#39;am, I&#39;m so sorry! He&#39;s usually better behaved than this. I lost my grip for just a second-I really didn&#39;t mean for this to happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena met his anxious eyes with a calm smile. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. He just has a lot of energy, that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over the servant&#39;s face. He gave her a grateful nod, and then steered the dog away,though the Border Collie still threw longing glances over his shoulder,letting out a few soft, mournful barks as he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the pair had disappeared down the hall, Verena let out a quiet sigh and eased back onto the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she made herself comfortable,something hard pressed against her foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shifted, frowning, and looked down, curiosity piqued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glimmer on the carpet caught her eye-a slender silver necklace rested there, its pendant perfectly round and dainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Light from the ceiling washed over the pendant,bringing out its icy shimmer. Verena bent down, gathering the necklace into her hand, and turned as if to call the servant back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the pendant&#39;s surface drew her focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finely engraved initials stood out-elegant and precise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s curiosity sharpened. She lifted the piece,examining the tiny letters: A and S, etched with delicate care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adara Sampson...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name slipped out, barely louder than a whisper, as Verena stared at the engraved letters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of a long-ago talk with Luis drifted through her mind, from just after she had uncovered her true identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could picture her brother, stretched out on the couch, an easy smile on his lips as he explained, &#34;You know, Mom and Dad wanted your name to be Adara Sampson. It means radiance, nobility-all the good things they wished for you. They even went all out and had a famous designer make a necklace, just for you.Your initials are on the pendant-A and S.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Luis had spoken that day lingered with her,every detail clear as if it had happened yesterday. Regret had softened his eyes, and the love he held for his sister was impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He described the necklace as something truly special -a pure silver chain, paired with a pendant so subtle,but every inch designed with care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to him, the letters seemed to grow from the metal itself, every curve and line blending perfectly together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But sometimes,life twisted those wishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she vanished, the necklace disappeared, too,taking her parents&#39; hopes with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the family, it became a silent ache they never quite spoke of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, right in her palm, the necklace with those same initials had resurfaced at the Kirk estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange tension gripped her as she held the delicate chain, her heart thudding and an uneasy feeling rising within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if her disappearance had something to do with Sherwood all along?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind spun with doubts, but the sound of a door snapping shut upstairs jerked her back to the present A familiar voice floated down the stairs. &#34;Did Harry get himself into trouble again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flutter of her lashes was all it took for Verena to hide her nerves. She slipped the necklace into her bag,movements quick and quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calm settled over her face as she straightened up and focused on the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The older servant, hearing Sherwood&#39;s voice, quickly stepped forward to explain. &#34;Sir, Harry made a dash for the living room again, but Kris managed to catch him and take him out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood made his way downstairs, dressed now in a loose set of loungewear, and nodded. &#34;Try to keep a closer eye on him next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood closed the distance between them,his smile warm and inviting. &#34;That dog&#39;s antics didn&#39;t give you too much of a fright, did he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena returned a polite smile, careful to hide the resentment that simmered beneath her calm exterior.&#34;It&#39;s no trouble, Mr. Kirk. Harry&#39;s got a playful streak.He just needs to burn off some energy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft laugh escaped Sherwood, and a touch of nostalgia colored his words. &#34;He&#39;s never been anything but wild since we brought him home. I sometimes think he&#39;ll outgrow it, but no luck yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met his gaze with a quiet nod, and then redirected the conversation. &#34;Shall we go ahead with your treatment,Mr.Kirk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle sweep of his hand, Sherwood gestured for her to follow. &#34;Of course, Verena. Let&#39;s get started.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then set off at a brisk pace in the direction of the family clinic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the private ward, he perched on the edge of the bed and shot her an easy smile. &#34;Looks like I need your expertise again, Verena. Sorry to keep asking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena pressed her lips together, her tone even. &#34;You don&#39;t have to apologize, Mr. Kirk. You&#39;re a close friend to my family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she spoke, she organized the instruments with practiced efficiency, placing each one neatly on the tray beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for a needle, she gently inserted it into his arm and kept her voice low. &#34;Since our last session,have you noticed anything different with your health,Mr.Kirk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood settled back against the pillows, a pleased grin spreading across his face. &#34;Honestly, Verena,you&#39;re a miracle worker. I went through doctor after  doctor-got poked, prodded, loaded up on prescriptions-and nothing changed. But ever since you started treating me, I feel like a new man. My appetite&#39;s back, I sleep like a baby, and my energy&#39;s never been better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the while, a silent, self-satisfied thought flickered through his mind. That was why he kept her on, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her spot at the head of the bed, Verena&#39;s lips quirked into the barest hint of a smirk, her eyes glinting with quiet irony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, her so-called remedies were just gentle tonics-nothing special, certainly not the miracle he claimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s intensity came from his own mind,shaped by everything he&#39;d convinced himself to believe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena took a steady breath and flashed a reassuring,practiced smile, as though she was greeting one of her patients at the hospital. &#34;It&#39;s good to know the treatment is helping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something noticeably different about Sherwood today. His reactions to the treatment didn&#39;t match his usual habits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to appear at ease during the session,muttering under his breath, &#34;Will this ever be over? just want to feel normal again. Can I get better soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena measured out his next dose, he tossed out the same questions for the third time, acting as if it were just casual conversation. &#34;Verena, do you think I&#39;m almost done with this whole thing? When do you think I&#39;ll finally be okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each time he asked, he changed the phrasing,shifted his tone, but the impatience in his voice kept coming through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena picked up on his nervousness immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in her gut told her that his questions today were more than concern for his recovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had to be another motive beneath his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like he was preparing for something,waiting for his moment to act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After weighing her response, Verena met his gaze and decided to tell him a time that was ahead of his normal recovery schedule. &#34;Mr. Kirk, you&#39;re making remarkable progress. If everything keeps going this way, you&#39;ll just need one more month before the doctor can move forward with the surgery,&#34; said Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched closely and caught the way Sherwood&#39;s eyes flashed, as if he were unable to hide a sudden spark of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though brief, the look on Sherwood&#39;s face did not slip past her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of amusement flickered in Verena&#39;s mind,but outwardly, she kept her face neutral and focused on her work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her instincts told her that her words had settled deep in Sherwood&#39;s thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suspected that if he had any ambitions, he would set his plans in motion before the month ran out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the session ended, Sherwood casually invited her to stick around for lunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered him a polite smile and explained she had business at the company that she couldn&#39;t put off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let it go, making no effort to convince her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena left the Kirk estate, heading straight for the garage without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost at the entrance, someone grabbed her wist with startling force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the blink of an eye, she was pulled into a secluded alleyway,hidden from the main road. Instinct took over as Verena gasped, both hands shielding her belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Molly?&#34; Verena steadied herself and narrowed her eyes, finally recognizing who stood before her.&#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly pressed an object into Verena&#39;s palm, her movements rushed and desperate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s hand closed around the cold handle of a dagger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up, searching Molly&#39;s face for an explanation, but what she saw was only heartbreak and misery, not a hint of aggression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her voice cold and unyielding, Verena asked,&#34;What are you trying to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly swallowed hard, her words shaky and strained.&#34;My father tried talking to Luis about marrying me, but he shot it down right away. I&#39;ve been calling him over and over, but it&#39;s like he&#39;s vanished. He just doesn&#39;t want anything to do with me.&#34;</p>
