                <p>&#34;Is this really a big favor?&#34; Isaac&#39;s voice was low, his question as soft as a ripple breaking still water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, puzzled, sank into the single-seater sofa across from him, her eyes resting on his face. &#34;Isaac,what do you mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, Isaac said nothing. His long fingers tapped lightly against the armrest of his wheelchair, as though he were weighing every word on a scale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, he raised his head, his eyes locking with hers,his expression solemn. &#34;Verena, doesn&#39;t it strike you as too coincidental? After you vanished, your father was heartbroken,Sampson Group fell into chaos, and Sherwood arrived at the perfect moment to steady the ship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena blinked, taken aback, her confusion deepening.&#34;Isaac, are you suggesting... Sherwood has ulterior motives? But he did help the Sampson family through those stormy times, and over the years, he&#39;s never made unreasonable demands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, think again,&#34; Isaac pressed,cutting straight to the heart of the matter. &#34;Sherwood, as the CEO of  Kirk Group, has no business entanglements with Sampson Group. He holds no authority inside Sampson Group-no shares, no position. How could Luis, sharp as he was, not notice? Back then, though inexperienced, he was still the rightful heir of Sampson Group. Even if others grumbled, they only whispered behind closed doors; none could topple him.He might have been young, but he wasn&#39;t a fool.With patience, bearing those rumors, his talent and vision would soon have carried him to the success he enjoys now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s voice grew sharper, his gaze unwavering. &#34;And yet Sherwood, an outsider, was able to silence dissent the moment he stepped in. Doesn&#39;t that tell you something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena faltered, unable to find words under lsaac&#39;s relentless reasoning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calmly, he continued, &#34;First, the discontent toward Luis was likely stirred by Sherwood-that&#39;s why he could smother it so easily. Second, it shows he must have bought off many high-ranking members,using the excuse of helping Luis learn the ropes to plant himself firmly inside Sampson Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sardonic smile touched Isaac&#39;s lips. &#34;Look now-his daughter may hold only a manager&#39;s title in Benedict Pharmaceuticals, but in truth, the company is almost within their grasp. From what I know, Luis has even  entrusted several key posts to the Kirks, all in the name of gratitude.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words were precise, each one cutting deeper,sending a chill down Verena&#39;s spine as she absorbed the frightening possibilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a healer celebrated around the world, her hands steady enough to pull lives back from the brink.But the battlefield of business, with its hidden daggers and unseen snares, was foreign ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to unraveling webs of power and deceit,she could not match Isaac&#39;s clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows knitted. &#34;So, the Kirk family&#39;s influence in Sampson Group runs far deeper than it seems on the surface...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,as though struck by a memory,Verena hesitated,her eyes clouded with doubt. &#34;But according to Luis,Sherwood has been friends with my parents for many years. How could he act like this? Could decades of friendship really be nothing but smoke and mirrors?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac sighed softly, his expression turning complex.&#34;Verena, such suspicions are not baseless. In the world of business, it&#39;s often said-there are no eternal friends, only eternal interests. Sherwood, after years in this arena, knows this better than anyone. No bond, no matter how cherished, can withstand the trial of profit.  To tell you the truth, when you were treating your mother tonight, I caught a glimpse in Sherwood&#39;s eyes -it was not the gaze of a man truly hoping for her recovery. Luis, bound by gratitude, may choose to look away, but you don&#39;t carry those same ties. That&#39;s why you must watch the Kirks with clear eyes, always mindful of the motives behind their every move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, and then reached for her hand, his broad,warm palm enclosing hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking into her clear eyes, his own gaze softened though his tone remained steady. &#34;I don&#39;t meddle in Sampson family matters; my position doesn&#39;t allow it.And I&#39;d never want you to think my feelings for you are chained to family interests. But if you ever stumble upon something that confuses you,something you&#39;re unsure about, come to me. I&#39;ll do all I can to help you untangle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth bloomed in Verena&#39;s heart, and she nodded gently. &#34;Isaac, I understand your care and your warnings. I will stay vigilant, and I won&#39;t let them harm my family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac drew her into his arms, his chin restinglightly on her hair, his voice low and magnetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are one, Verena. Your burdens are mine;your family is mine to guard.&#34; Breathing deeply against his chest, she felt his warmth,his strong heartbeat steady beneath her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tightened her embrace, wrapping her arms around his broad back, nodding softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s palm patted her back with tender rhythm,soothing her like a lullaby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nestled in his arms, Verena allowed her eyes to close,basking in the shelter of his warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room grew still, filled only with the cadence of their breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft glow of the lamps painted their silhouettes together. Verena&#39;s figure, almost swallowed in Isaac&#39;s embrace, made his form appear all the more tender,as though light and shadow conspired to reveal his gentler side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His features-handsome and sharp by nature-now softened,his high nose and faintly curved lips carrying a quiet smile, his dark eyes unfathomable pools.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time slipped by unnoticed until Verena stirred, her eyes fluttering open in a haze of drowsiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a small yawn and rose,her voice hushed.&#34;I&#39;m a little tired. I should take a shower.&#34; As she moved to leave his embrace, Isaac&#39;s hand caught her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned back, brows arching in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his head, meeting her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, the air thickened, charged with something unspoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes, bright as spring water, blinked curiously,lashes trembling like butterfly wings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lamplight cast a glow across her face, deepening her loveliness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s throat tightened; he pressed his lips together,a faint blush touching the tips of his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>br</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice dropped lower than usual, laced with awkwardness. &#34;I need a shower too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena froze for a moment, searching his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>6His gaze wavered, veiled with unspoken desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understanding dawned, and the corners of her lips &#39;curved in amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A playful gleam flashed in her eyes. She tilted her 2head and teased lightly,&#34;What, afraidI&#39;ll use up all the hot water?&#34;  Isaac cleared his throat, turning his flushed face aside.&#34;That&#39;s not what I meant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At times like these, he was still as endearingly awkward as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s soft laugh slipped out,tinged with cunning mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned closer, her arms braced on the wheelchair&#39;s armrests, encircling him completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her unique scent surrounded him, making his heart stumble in its rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, his tense hands gripped the wheelchair&#39;s edges tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His throat bobbed, parched, as though fire licked within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her voice came, warm and teasing,brushing his ear like a breeze. &#34;All right then... let&#39;s showNer together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words struck him like lightning, scattering images through his mind in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath quickened, the flush burning from his cheeks down to his neck.</p>
