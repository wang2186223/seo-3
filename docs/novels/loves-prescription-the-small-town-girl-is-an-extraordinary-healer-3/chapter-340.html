                <p>On the golf course, Sherwood and Luis each took their positions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood bent down,took out the club from the bag,and slowly polished the shaft with his palm. Wearing a genial smile, he lined up his shot and swung first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The white ball arced cleanly through the air before settling firmly on the fairway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening his back, Sherwood turned to Luis and asked with casual ease, &#34;Luis, how are things going with the company lately? I hear the progress on that last project was remarkable. It seems you&#39;re becoming more and more adept at steering the ship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis walked to his ball without hurry, adjusted his stance, and delivered a precise stroke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after the ball soared did he respond calmly,&#34;Thanks to your support, everything has gone smoothly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood chuckled, carrying on the business talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if remembering something suddenly, he remarked casually, &#34;I heard about Molly&#39;s actions at Benedict Pharmaceuticals. I assume you&#39;ve heard the same?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis gave a slight nod, lips pressed together, choosing silence over words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Sherwood exhaled gently, his tone carrying a trace of apology. &#34;Molly was reckless this time, and her approach was indeed wrong. She deserves a hard lesson. I&#39;ve already scolded her thoroughly at home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis stood not far away, his posture straight, his composure unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood swung again, and then straightened and continued, &#34;Verena is a rare talent. At such a young age, she shows remarkable decisiveness and handles matters with great efficiency. I truly seepotential in her. One day, she will surely carve her name in the business world-just like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, Sherwood discreetly studied Luis &#39;expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Kirk, thank you for your kind words.&#34; The mention of Verena drew a faint smile from Luis, tinged with quiet pride. &#34;I trust Verena&#39;s abilities. It won&#39;t be long before she shines brightly and clears her own path.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luis, your fondness for Verena is plain for all to see.&#34;Sherwood shook his head with a sigh of regret. &#34;If only Molly had a brother so protective, someone who always thought of her well-being.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stroked his club while glancing toward the distant hole. &#34;Still, you are right-Verena has a drive that will carry her far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis remained silent, simply adjusting his stance. He raised his club with taut muscles and swung in a smooth,natural arc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a crisp crack, the ball soared skyward, tracing a graceful line before dropping perfectly into the hole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s gaze shifted from the hole back to Luis,his narrowed eyes betraying a tangle of emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard to tell whether he admired Luis&#39; flawless technique or whether other thoughts lay hidden beneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time flies, doesn&#39;t it?&#34; Sherwood sighed. &#34;Now Verena stands on her own. I recall when she went missing-your father fell ill with worry, your mother suffered a breakdown, and you had not yet taken up the company&#39;s reins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sigh deepened, laced with a show of sorrow. &#34;So l had to summon my courage and shoulder the task,coordinating relationships left and right, fearful Sampson Group might collapse in that storm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, letting his gaze sweep toward Luis as if in  passing. &#34;There were rumors then, claiming our Kirk family wished to profit from your family&#39;s misfortune.Honestly, those days were suffocating. But you and your family never thought that way, and you placed trust in my character. Thankfully, we weathered it together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, Luis would have taken these words at face value. But ever since Verena warned him of Sherwood&#39;s hidden designs, his heart no longer heard them the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile was timed to perfection, his eyes steady and serene. As his lashes lowered, they cast faint shadows,masking whatever stirred beneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet his tone stayed respectful, his manner both humble and dignified. &#34;Mr. Kirk, you&#39;re right. Those days were harsh, but in the end the family endured,and my sister returned. For that, we remain grateful for your help back then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood waved dismissively with a cheerfulgrin,as though to brush aside the thanks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, as if struck by a thought, he leaned toward Luis with the air of paternal concern. &#34;Luis, I had a long talk with your father last night. Our two families have always shared a bond, close as kin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched Luis&#39; face closely and went on with a  smile, &#34;We both agreed it&#39;s time you settled down.You and Molly grew up side by side; our families know each other inside and out. That foundation is something others only envy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s smile grew more meaningful. &#34;Molly&#39;s feelings for you are no secret. She has cared for you since childhood, and she&#39;s a kind-hearted girl-an ideal partner for life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a slight pause, and then shifted the subject naturally. &#34;You&#39;ve always been decisive. If you have no objections, your father and I think it&#39;s time to choose a day this year to settle your engagement with Molly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, he patted Luis&#39; shoulder gently, as if the matter were already sealed. &#34;Once you two marry, our families will be bound even closer, and the road ahead will only grow brighter...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I object,&#34; Luis suddenly cut in, his voice steady and firm, breaking Sherwood&#39;s illusion like glass under a hammer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s smile froze, his lips still curved yet stiff,as though carved from stone. Though he had half-expected it, hearing Luis&#39; open refusal left him unsettled and displeased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis remained calm, his gaze level and unwavering.&#34;Mr. Kirk, I&#39;ve always respected you. But when it comes to Molly, I have only ever regarded her as a sister-nothing beyond that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood&#39;s jaw tensed,his smile locked in an awkward grimace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He steadied himself, forcing warmth into his tone.&#34;Luis, I understand. Matters of the heart must be weighed with care. Still, when you&#39;re in the thick of it,clarity is often the first casualty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile grew strained, his voice gentle. &#34;Why not start with dating, free of pressure? Perhaps you&#39;ll find Molly is the perfect match after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only I can decide who is right for me.&#34; Luis&#39; lips curved faintly, but the smile never reached his eyes.&#34;Every step I&#39;ve taken, every choice I&#39;ve made, has been thought through. I regret none of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of Sherwood&#39;s stiff expression, Luis softened his tone though his eyes stayed sharp. &#34;Mr.Kirk, I value your concern. But please respect my decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his wrist, glancing at his watch. &#34;Forgive me,I have other matters to attend to. Excuse me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight bow, Luis turned without hesitation and strode off the course,leaving Sherwood no chance to reply.</p>
