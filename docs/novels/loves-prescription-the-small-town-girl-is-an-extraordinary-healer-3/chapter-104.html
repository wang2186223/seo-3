                <p>Following that phone call, Verena realized Isaac hadn&#39;t sent her any flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but wonder if he was secretly planning something special for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity tugged at her about whatever &#34;surprise&#34;Isaac might be plotting, but Verena chose not to bring it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She figured the truth would reveal itself soon enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time sped by as the wedding approached, and suddenly it was just one day before the ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena scrolled through her contacts, only to remember that most of herclosest friends either lived overseas or were already settled down with families.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every detail for the big day was set, except for the bridesmaid, a worry that had lingered for days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over breakfast, Verena looked at lsaac and asked,&#34;Did you already pick your groomsmen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nodding,Isaac caught the worry in her voice and quickly assured her, &#34;Don&#39;t stress about it. If we need to, we can always hire professional bridesmaids.&#34; Verena answered without much thought, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, a part of her still wished her dearest friends could stand by her side for the wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the sound of her phone buzzing snapped her out of her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena answered the call without glancing at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena! Seriously,what is wrong with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A blast of noise from the other end nearly made Verena&#39;s ears ring, forcing her to hold the phone at arm&#39;s length.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognizing the voice, she asked, &#34;Miranda? What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda Brown&#39;s frustration was obvious. &#34;Are you kidding me right now? My best friend&#39;s about to walk down the aisle, and I have to find out from Gavin, of all people? Do you even consider me your friend anymore? If I hadn&#39;t caught up with him, I&#39;d still be clueless. So, were you really going to keep me in the dark forever?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in college at Pine Hill University, Miranda and Verena had met at a campus mixer. Even though Miranda majored in Computer Science and Verena was  in a different department, the two quickly became close friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda had become the CEO of a famous global tech company,recognized all around the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Verena came back home, their demandng jobs made it hard for them to keep in touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing she should have reached out to her close friend, Verena offered a regretful explanation. &#34;I just thought you had so much going on at work, and l didn&#39;t want to bother you. Besides, the wedding&#39;s pretty far from you, and I figured it&#39;d be tough for you to come all this way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda let out a loud scoff. &#34;Don&#39;t give me that excuse! No amount of work would ever keep me from your wedding!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh slipped from Verena before Miranda continued,&#34;I already grabbed the first available flight,and I&#39;m at the airport now. Unless something goes wrong, I&#39;ll be back in the country tonight. And just so you know, I&#39;m officially claiming my spot as your bridesmaid. You promised, remember? No backing out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda was a bundle of restless energy, yet she and Verena had one majorthing in common-they were both devoted to their work. No matter the occasion, Miranda would tackle every deadline before making time for anything or anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena honestly hadn&#39;t imagined Miranda would drop everything and fly across the globe just to stand beside her as her bridesmaid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of gratitude warmed her, and she broke into a gentle smile. &#34;Of course you&#39;ll be my bridesmaid.Travel safe, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda answered, &#34;Got it. I&#39;ll see you tonight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call ended, Verena found herself grinning,her spirits noticeably lifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Isaac couldn&#39;t help but hear every word,thanks to Miranda&#39;s booming voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced up and asked, &#34;Was that your friend calling from overseas?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded, still smiling.&#34;Yeah, she&#39;ll be here by tonight.&#34;</p>
