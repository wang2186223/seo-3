                <p>At Laura&#39;s question, Alec broke into a hearty laugh,the creases around his eyes deepening. &#34;You&#39;re absolutely dazzling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to something they both cared about,they looked like newlyweds still wrapped up in the glow of their honeymoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both understood that today marked a turning point for their standing in Shoildon. After all, Barrie&#39;s decision to visit their home with his family was no ordinary honor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word in Shoildon never stayed secret for long, and they were certain the elite circles would soon buzz with news of this visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler approached quickly, voice laced with respect. &#34;Mr. Willis, Mrs. Willis, I&#39;ve just been informed by the Lyons family&#39;s butler that Mr. Barrie  Lyons and his household are already on their way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement flashed in Alec&#39;s eyes as he met Laura&#39;s gaze, and then motioned to the butler. &#34;Quickly,make sure the refreshments are ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight furrow appeared on Laura&#39;s brow. &#34;I&#39;ll see what&#39;s keeping Kaia. Why isn&#39;t she downstairs yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec gave a quick nod. &#34;Yes, bring her down right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They couldn&#39;t have been prouder of Kaia. Without her talent, a connection with the Lyons family-especially on such favorable terms-would have been unthinkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clicking up the stairs in her heels, Laura&#39;s excitement got the better of her, and she pushed open the door without a knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaia, why are you still dawvdling? Barrie and his family will be here any minute,&#34; Laura exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she approached the vanity, Laura&#39;s eyes gleamed with pride at the sight of her daughter.  Kaia wore a pale blue strapless gown draped with a white fur coat, her look both graceful and striking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My goodness, you&#39;d outshine anyone no matter what you wore,&#34; Laura said warmly as she smoothed Kaia&#39;s sleek hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting a perfume bottle, Kaia spritzed her wrist and dabbed it behind her ear, a smug smile tugging at her lips. &#34;Mom, people have admired me since I was little. Haven&#39;t you gotten used to it by now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s eyes shone with satisfaction. &#34;Yes, yes, your beauty is endless. But hurry now. Barrie is an elder,and it wouldn&#39;t be right to make him wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her chin tipped upward, Kaia muttered,&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, inside, Kaia dismissed Laura&#39;s caution. Elder or not, she had saved Barrie&#39;s life. Was there any need to tremble before him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man struggled with long-term illnesses, and she had practically pulled him back from the brink. Even if she carried herself with a touch of arrogance, who could fault her? Yet she understood why Laura pressed for humility-their family&#39;s position still couldn&#39;t measure up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek black vehicle belonging to the Lyons family eased around the bend and rolled into the driveway of the Willis Villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the entrance of the main house, the Willis butler spotted the vehicle and hurried back inside to deliver the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With excitement in his voice, he announced to Alec,&#34;The Lyons&#39; vehicle has just pulled in-our guests are here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Springing from the sofa, Alec turned to Laura on the sofa and Kaia, who had just stepped down the staircase. &#34;Come on, let&#39;s greet Barrie and his family properly. We have to show them respect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura rose to join him, but Kaia walked to the sofa and sat down, smoothing her hair with one hand and resting the other on her lap. &#34;You two go ahead. I&#39;l stay here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s face showed bewilderment, while Alec assumed Kaia was growing arrogant because of Barrie&#39;s regard for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint scowl, Alec warned, &#34;Kaia, this won&#39;t do.Even if you treated Barrie&#39;s leg, you must stilI act with humility before someone older.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia pushed out her lower lip. &#34;That&#39;s not what I meant, Dad. I just don&#39;t want it to look like I&#39;m desperate to butter up the Lyons family. Go on without me.I&#39;ll wait here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Alec felt like continuing the lecture,he cut himself short with the Lyons family at the door.&#34;Forget it,&#34; he muttered, striding outside with Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the vehicle, as the driver looked for a spot to park, the Lyons family of four carried on a lively conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the inside pocket of his suit jacket,Fletcher drew out a sleek black-gold card and looked at Barrie, saying, &#34;Dad, I wasn&#39;t around when Dr. Willis  treated you, but Slater was inconsiderate and failed to thank her properly. Since we&#39;re going in person this time, I intend to do it right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater immediately protested, his eyes flicking to the card. &#34;Inconsiderate? That&#39;s unfair, Dad. If you want to thank Dr. Willis, money isn&#39;t the way. She&#39;s not like the others-she&#39;s more like those legendary doctors from novels who couldn&#39;t care less about riches.Grandpa once tried to offer her a generous sum. She turned it down, saying she&#39;d been paid her fee and didn&#39;t need anything else.&#34;</p>
