                <p>Ever since Verena asked Samuel to investigate Carl, she had been anxiously waiting for his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That particular day, right as she reached the hospital, her phone sounded with a message alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After parking, Verena stepped out of her car and rummaged through her bag to grab her phone. The screen glowed, revealing a message from Samuel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening it quickly, she read every word with full attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel&#39;s message said, &#34;Verena, I must admit, the man you wanted me to check out is one of the most difficult cases I&#39;ve seen. After Carl left your hospital in Clokron, he vanished in just a few months, almost as if he never existed. I searched every avenue and used every tool I had, but his background remains a blank.The only thing I could track down were a handful of photos showing places he visited before disappearing.I couldn&#39;t find anything else that would help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three photos appeared at the end of the message.	 Each one was shot at night under poor lighting. Judging by his silhouette and the hair falling across his eyes, Verena could barely recognize Carl in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with those photos, it wasn&#39;t enough to move forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena pressed her lips together and furrowed her brow, frustration rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl&#39;s name echoed in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had come into her life out of nowhere and slipped away just as suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her eyes and sank into thought, searching for answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Ivan was right in thinking Carl killed Shawna just to keep her away from lsaac, then his sudden disappearance only made everything seem more suspicious. Looking up, Verena&#39;s eyes caught a hard glimmer. It struck her that Ivan might actually be right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind filled with scenes, each one rolling by like a movie-Shawna lying lifeless in bed, her own frantic dash back home, and Isaac tangled in a wreck on the roadside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Piece by piece, the puzzle was coming together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s fingers clenched tight around her phone. The deeper she thought, the clearer it became that something wasn&#39;t right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s accident didn&#39;t seem random anymore. It screamed of something planned, something dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury crashed over her, and she slammed her fist into the nearest hospital wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made a silent promise to herself. She would get to the bottom of this. For Shawna, she would find justice and expose whoever caused Isaac&#39;s crash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, she would track Carl down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she moved toward the hospital entrance, Verena&#39;s mind raced. The tangled thoughts pressed down,making her dizzy.介</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she walked into the lobby on the first floor, the room seemed to spin around her. She could not tell if it was the world that swayed or just her own body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to reach for support, her hand stretching out for a column, but her strength failed. Her knees gave way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the moment she realized the problem was her own body, not the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand flew to her stomach, a protective instinct for the baby. Then her vision faded as she collapsed to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cries of concern rose from.the people nearby, and they hurried to help. Right then, someone pushed through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s face was pale with panic as he rushed to catch her. Before he could reach her, another figure shouldered Simon aside with force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin shoved him out of the way.&#34;Step aside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Gavin gathered Verena into his arms and raced her into the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon stumbled back, but a fierce anger flared in his eyes as he watched Gavin whisk Verena away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the next instant, Simon darted after them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving quickly, Gavin brought Verena into a hospital room, called for doctors right away, and then grabbed his phone to reach lsaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Isaac got the call, he dropped everything and sped over to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he arrived, Verena had already regained consciousness. She was lying in bed, an IV drip beside her,with a doctor checking her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the doctor wrapped up the exam, Isaac&#39;s voice trembled, &#34;Doctor, what caused her to pass out? Is she going to be alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor replied with a reassuring tone,&#34;Thhere&#39;s no need to worry. She&#39;s pregnant, and all the stress and exhaustion led to a bout of anemia. That&#39;s what caused her to faint. She just needs time to rest, eat well,and avoid stress. It isn&#39;t anything serious. Give her a few days to recover, and she&#39;ll be just fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Isaac finally released a shaky breath, feeling relief wash over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the doctor left, Isaac moved closer to Verena, gently holding her face in his hands. His eyes were full of concern and regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I let you down,&#34; he admitted softly. &#34;If I&#39;d been paying more attention, I would have noticed how tired you&#39;ve been.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena tried to smile, but her throat felt parched and she struggled to find her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw her discomfort right away, poured her a glass of water, and helped her drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s fingers rested lightly on his hand, his touch bringing a sense of peace she needed. After she sipped some water, she murmured softly, &#34;Didn&#39;t the doctor say I&#39;ll be fine? You shouldn&#39;t blame yourself. Besides, I&#39;m a doctor too. If anything was wrong, I&#39;d know before anyone else. Just trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac looked closely at her pale features, noticing the stubborn set of her brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood exactly why she had collapsed-she had been running herself ragged trying to uncover Shawna&#39;s killer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>W/ith his own brows drawn tight, Isaac&#39;s voice came out firm but caring. &#34;Verena, I get how much this means to you. I&#39;ve already asked Jacob to keep investigating. Whoever killed your grandmother will pay. But right now, you need to think of yourself first. Remember, you&#39;re carrying our child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That steady look from him sent a pang through Verena&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought about confessing it all-that the car crash and Shawna&#39;s death seemed connected, maybe even the work of the same person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She almost told him that it could have been twisted jealousy that had cost his father&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena hesitated, shaking her head slightly. The loss of his father already weighed so heavily on Isaac, guilt slowing his recovery. If he learned the truth nowv, it might break him for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were just too many secrets tangled up together. She decided she would wait until lsaac&#39;s legs healed before revealing everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw the worry in his eyes and tried to reassure him with a gentle smile, her hand resting protectively on her belly. &#34;I understand. For your sake, and for the baby, I&#39;ll be more careful from now on. That&#39;s a promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her answer seemed to finally bring Isaac a bit of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gentle sunlight poured into the room, falling softly over Verena&#39;s weary face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac reached for her hand, his grip gentle. &#34;You haven&#39;t had a good night&#39;s sleep in days. Just rest now. I&#39;m right here with you.&#34; Verena looked up and met the warmth in his gaze. A gentle comfort spread through her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him a small nod, her eyelids growing heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last few days had been a blur, and rest had always slipped out of reach. Now, though, the exhaustion settled over her, and she drifted off to sleep within moments.</p>
