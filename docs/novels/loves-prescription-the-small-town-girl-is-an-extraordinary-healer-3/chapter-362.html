                <p>At the Sampson Villa,moonlight spilled through the thin curtains, washing Verena&#39;s room in a cold,silvery haze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac stepped inside and spotted Verena perched on the bed, flipping idly through a magazine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just seeing her there seemed to lift the fatigue from his shoulders. His pace softened as he moved closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve actually talked all day,&#34; he said, easing down beside her and slipping an arm gently arouund her. His words carried a mix of exhaustion and quiet affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena set her magazine aside, concern flickering in her eyes as she studied him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s late nights and early mornings had started to take their toll, with shadows darkening his eyes. She reached over and brushed his hair back. &#34;Isaac,something&#39;s weighing on you, isn&#39;t it? You look dead on your feet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a small nod, meeting her gaze. &#34;There&#39;s something important I need to share with you.&#34; Verena fell silent, her attention fixed on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a deep breath, Isaac began to explain everything -how he made Howe a pawn, how he schemed against Sherwood, every step of his latest battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena listened, her face growing more solemn with each detail. By the end, her brow was tightly knitted in worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence hung between them for a moment before she spoke. &#34;I remember seeing Howe outside Sherwood&#39;s place once. He struck me as odd, so I checked up on him afterward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice turned sharp, every syllable steady. &#34;From what you&#39;ve told me, it has to be Sherwood who orchestrated my disappearance. Howe must have been his accomplice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac squeezed her hand, his tone reassuring. &#34;Don&#39;t worry,Verena. I promised I&#39;d get answers for you.Howe knows the truth, and tomorrow morning, I&#39;ll go straight to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;I want to be there too,&#34; she insisted,her voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac could see she needed to hear the truth straight from Howe.He gave a reassuring nod. &#34;Of course. We&#39;ll face this together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile broke through Verena&#39;s worry as she rested her head on his shoulder, her heart caught somewhere between relief and concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So all this running around, you&#39;ve only done it for me,&#34;she said softly, a hint of worry in her tone. &#34;You just got back on your feet. You shouldn&#39;t exhaust yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear, his words gentle. &#34;Don&#39;t say that. You&#39;re my wife. If it&#39;s for you,nothing is ever too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning sunlight poured through the curtains,spreading warmth across their bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By sunrise, Isaac and Verena were already up, quickly preparing to leave. Soon, they were on the road to the house where Howe was hiding out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence hung between them as they drove.Verena wrestled with her emotions, torn between wanting answers and the bitterness of knowing how Sherwood had fooled her parents and brother all these years, causing them pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac noticed the tension in her posture and slipped his hand into hers, his rough thumb tracing slow,soothing circles across her palm. When they finally arrived, Howe was still planted on the sofa, while Gabby kept her hands busy, trying to distract herself with small tasks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swung open quietly, and Isaac&#39;s silhouette filled the doorway. Howe stiffened instantly, unease written across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting Verena at Isaac&#39;s side only deepened his unease, and his eyes dropped to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stood tall, every inch the consummate professional, her poise unshaken by the tension in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe pushed himself up from the sofa, lips parting as if to speak, but no words found their way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not here to waste time, Howe. I have some questions, and I expect honest answers,&#34; Verena said,her voice ringing with clarity and a touch of frost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to meet her eyes, Howe dropped his gaze.shifting uncomfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wife caught the silent cue and quietly slipped away,giving them space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the room fell quiet, Howe swallowed and finally remarked, &#34;Mrs. Bennett, ask me anything you need to know. Verena steadied herself with a slow breath. &#34;I want the truth about what happened all those years ago. Was it Sherwood who planned my disappearance? And what exactly wvas your part in it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite bracing himself for this moment, Howe&#39;s hands shook ever so slightly at her directness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, he nodded, voice low. &#34;It&#39;s true.Sherwood was behind everything. He set it up hoping to hurt your father and line his own pockets.As for me,1... I handled some of the dirty work because he told me to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of anger flashed in Verena&#39;s eyes. &#34;You knew what you were doing would ruin lives. How could you go along with it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret crept into Howe&#39;s voice, his shoulders slumping.&#34;I was scared out of my mind. Sherwood threatened my family. He said if I didn&#39;t help, they&#39;d pay the price.I lost my nerve. I couldn&#39;t see another way out...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Sherwood didn&#39;t just corner Howe by using his family as leverage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also laid out an offer that was too tempting to ignore. If Howe agreed to help him stage Verena&#39;s disappearance, he&#39;d walk away with a hefty payout and find himself rising fast through the ranks of Sherwood&#39;s company. For as long as he could remember, Howe had craved status and money. Presented with Sherwood&#39;s tantalizing offer, he hadn&#39;t even hesitated before getting his hands dirty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, under Verena&#39;s unwavering gaze,he realized confessing everything would only seal his own fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate, Howe decided to play down his involvement and pin the blame entirely on Sherwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, however, had seen too much to be fooled by such a performance. Years in cutthroat boardrooms had trained him to spot the lies hiding behind a mask of regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To most, Howe&#39;s words might sound humble and desperate. Isaac heard only self-preservation and half -truths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood never relied on threats alone; he was the kind of man who mixed promises of fortune with a touch of menace, always knowing how to bait his traps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, cold grin spread across Isaac&#39;s face, but it carried no hint of kindness. He leaned in, voice dry with sarcasm. &#34;So that&#39;s how it is, Howe? You really think you can brush me off with half-truths? You think I&#39;ve spent a lifetime in business and can&#39;t see through your games?&#34; Howe visibly flinched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that bravado vanished. In Isaac&#39;s eyes, his so-called cunning was nothing but a pitiful display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe&#39;s shoulders caved, hands curling into tight fists at his sides. Sweat broke out across his brow. Dread crawled up his spine as the weight of the situation closed in on him. There was no escape, and if he kept the truth buried any longer, Isaac, with all that he was capable of, would unleash consequences far worse than he could bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a shaky breath, Howe finally forced himself to meet Isaac&#39;s gaze, eyes wide with fear. &#34;Mr. Bennett,you&#39;re right. I shouldn&#39;t have tried to hide anything.The truth is, Sherwood not only threatened me-he offered me a huge payoff and a big promotion if l helped him. I let my greed get the better of me.That&#39;s why I agreed to his plan.&#34;</p>
