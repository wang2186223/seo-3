                <p>Isaac&#39;s long road of recovery after surgery had finally reached its end. Verena, ever thoughtful, had arranged everything beforehand, making sure he could be discharged in time to rest at home before takíng steady steps toward his rehabilitation exercises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving Willis Villa, Verena went directly back to Seraphina Villas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the second floor, she pushed open the door with quiet care and lifted her gaze-only to find Isaac sitting on the sofa, a newspaper spread in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gentle rustle of turning pages echoed in the silence, though his eyes were distant, as if he were waiting for something rather than truly reading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lamplight spilled softly over him, outlining his fine profile with a calm glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lingered at the doorway, and warmth welled up in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew-he was waiting for her return. And yet, in the next breath, sorrow struck her chest like a sudden tide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at his straight but slender back, Verena understood why the barrier in his heart was so hard to break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought that Shawna had died because of her pressed down like a weight, leaving her almost breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only she hadn&#39;t been so intent on proving herseIf, on making Laura and Alec regret abandoning her; if only she hadn&#39;t drawn so much attention abroad-perhaps Shawna would have been spared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Verena knew what was done could never be undone, her heart still drifted toward the &#34;if onlys&#34; of a life that could never be lived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After learning that Shawna&#39;s passing was no accident, Verena felt the echo of Isaac&#39;s pain.	 She knew he carried blame in hisown heart-believing his father&#39;s death was his fault, punishing himself with each breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could relate. She, too, blamed herself for failing to protect Shawna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tear slipped down as Verena crossed the room, kneeling gently before Isaac and resting her head upon his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tenderness made Isaac lower the newspaper, his body instinctively ready to respond to her closeness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as his hand settled on her shoulder and words formed on his lips, her choked whisper reached him.&#34;Isaac, I&#39;m so sad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand froze; his chest tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never before had Verena shown such raw vulnerability before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tears soaked into his trousers, leaving a damp trace that seared his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac could not bear it. Taking her hand, he drew her up and gathered her into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat on his lap now, her brows knitted, her hair slightly in disarray, a fragile picture etched by sorrow. Seeing her tear-streaked face, Isaac&#39;s eyes softened with a mixture of tenderness and ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brushed away the tears with infinite care, as though he were holding something too precious to risk breaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, what happened?&#34; His voice was low, almost trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her lip hard, unable to form a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight tore at him even more. Still wiping her tears with his thumb, he guessed, &#34;Is this about my legs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her silence felt like confirmation, and he tried to soothe her. &#34;You&#39;ve given everything, more than anyone could. If my legs never fully heal, I can accept that. What matters most is having you by my side. But... if you feel weighed down, I won&#39;t hold you back.&#34; His voice was rough, carrying a sorrow he couldn&#39;t hide. Meeting her eyes, he added softly, &#34;Please, don&#39;t cry anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing he had misunderstood, Verena shook her head quickly.&#34;NO1it&#39;s about my grandmother...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your grandmother?&#34; His expression faltered. &#34;But she&#39;s already-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had spoken of her grandmother before; he knew she was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Grandma has left us.&#34; Verena&#39;s eyes reddened further as she gritted her teeth. &#34;But I just learned her death wasn&#39;t an accident-it was murder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze flickered in shock.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A friend stumbled across an old bounty posted on a dark trading site... and the target was my grandmother.&#34; She paused, her voice tremmbling. &#34;It&#39;s all my fault. If I hadn&#39;t drawn enemies abroad, if I hadn&#39;t left her vulnerable, she would never have been hurt. She must have felt so alone, so helpless. She must blame me for not protecting her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed as she leaned into Isaac&#39;s shoulder, soaking his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sobs pierced him like a knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He used to think Verena didn&#39;t need him as much as he needed her. Yet, when she finally needed him, he realized his own helplessness, his inaboility to lift her grief. He despised himself for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to her cry, he wrestled with disbelief-how could someone stoop so low as to target the elderly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with Verena in his arms, all he could do was comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held her tighter, his warm hand moving gently across her back, a steady rhythm of reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shawna loved you dearly. She could never lay blame at your feet. The guilt is not yours to bear-it belongs only to the killers. Even if they struck at her because of you, the crime is theirs, not yours, Victims.should not shoulder the sins of their tormentors. I know your heart is breaking, but we cannot drown forever in sorrow. The way forward is clear-we must find who killed Shawna, and only then can justice be done.&#34; Verena slowly lifted her head, her reddened eyes now shining with fierce determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her lip, raised her chin, and declared, &#34;You&#39;re right, Isaac. I won&#39;t let my grandma&#39;s death be meaningless.I swear I&#39;ll uncover the truth and see that the guilty pay dearly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her trembling lips and tear-streaked face told him how much effort it took to speak so firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed her cheek softly, murmuring, &#34;Forgive me. I shouldn&#39;t have asked for calm when your heart is torn. Cry if you must-let it all out. We&#39;Il fight for Shawna&#39;s justice together. Remember, you are never alone.You have me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words broke down the last wall of her defenses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clung to him tightly, sobbing with a force that shook her whole body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as though every pent-up grief finally poured out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac held her in silence, his hand patting her back with the patience of someone soothing a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time slipped away unnoticed until her sobs subsided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking down, he saw her asleep against his chest, traces of tears still glistening on her lashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nose was stuffy from crying, her lips parted slightly, making her look almost like a wronged child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the evening chill settledin, Isaac quietly picked up his phone and asked Rhonda to bring a blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda soon entered, carrying one. She paused-at the sight-Verena fast asleep in Isaac&#39;s embrace, while he held her with such quiet devotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder he had asked for silence; he was lulling his wife to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth spread in Rhonda&#39;s heart, and she thought to herself-lsaac truly treated his wife with great tenderness.</p>
