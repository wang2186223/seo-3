                <p>Jacob paused,and then continued, &#34;Luis says he&#39;s here to talk business with you, Mr. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis Sampson?.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name caught Isaac&#39;s attention and made him wary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought back to just yesterday when Verena mentioned Luis asking for her contact information.Now the man was here, pushing for some kind of partnership.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac did not buy it for a second. There had to be more going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight tilt of his chin, Isaac instructed firmly,&#34;Bring him to my office. I want to see what he&#39;s after.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob gave a nod. &#34;Right away, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, Luis walked into the office and immediately spotted Isaac behind his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac sat with perfect posture, his sharp suit only adding to his air of authority. There was something striking about his appearance-the straight nose, thick  lashes, and dark, thoughtful eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis nearly laughed to himself. It was no wonder so many women in Shoildon had once set their sights on Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But those days were gone, swept away by life&#39;s changes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After collecting himself, Luis put on a polite smile and bowed slightly. &#34;Mr. Bennett, sorry for dropping in without warning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes lifted, catching Luis with a cold, searching look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Luis was smiling, his gaze stayed frosty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious to lsaac that Luis had something more in mind than just business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Showing hostility toward someone polite never came easy. With that smile, Luis had given him no valid reason to shut the door on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing a faint smile, lsaac motioned toward the cushioned chair across from him. &#34;Mr. Sampson,think nothing of it. Please, make yourself comfortable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis took the offer, settling into the chair with one leg crossed over the other. The polished shine of his designer shoes gleamed under the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>is leaned back in his chair, letting a quiet stillness attle over the office before either of them spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>long moment passed before hefinally addressed saac, voice steady and sure. &#34;People might call this our first introduction, Mr. Bennett, but in reality,our oaths have already crossed in the world of finance and ousiness news.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Isaac with unwavering focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a reserved response, Isaac acknowledged him,Ris face unreadable and calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis wasted no time circling the main issue. &#34;I&#39;ll put aside the pleasantries. Let&#39;s talk business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers drummed softly on the arm of his chair as he began to outline his offer.&#34;There&#39;s a saying about Shoildon&#39;s clear skies and the wealth hidden beneath themn. My goal is to launch the most ambitious real estate development in this country and the neighboring areas, but I&#39;ve run into a problem-your company holds several crucial properties I need. I&#39;m willing to offer you a ten percent stake in the project if you agree to hand over those sites. It would be a win for us both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The offer hovered in the air, and the office felt even quieter for a moment. Isaac met his proposal with a narrowed gaze, a spark of calculation lighting his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let the silence linger, and then replied with deliberate calm, &#34;It&#39;s an interesting proposal, Mr.Sampson, but we&#39;re both aware those properties outstrip the value of your entire plan. So, what you present as generous is actually asking too much.Bennett Group is not in the habit of striking uneven deals. We&#39;ve always had our pick of partners.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis didn&#39;t flinch; he had expected Isaac&#39;s reaction. He wore a faint smile as he responded, &#34;If the offer doesn&#39;t meet your expectations, Mr. Bennett, I&#39;m open to making adjustments. But I do have one condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s brow lifted, recognizing immediately that the true motive lay within that one condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave Luis the space to speak his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis added, &#34;I want in on your company&#39;s next entertainment investment. Let me buy a stake and join the project. What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gave a low, humorless laugh, his stare turning even more direct. &#34;You really are a strategist, Mr.Sampson. First, you come in with a hefty demand,then you try to look generous while reaching for our most valuable venture. It&#39;s true that businesspeople chase profits, but we don&#39;t start trouble with those on  our level. You and I work in different spheres-opposite sides of the business map.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words hung in the air, his eyes holding the trace of a smile that never touched his lips. His strong features remained utterly composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if my information&#39;s right, Mr. Sampson, you moved your sights overseas just last month. Why pivot to Shoildon now? Your sudden interest makes me wonder about your real intentions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he was done speaking, Isaac stayed perfectly still, sitting upright in his wheelchair without the slightest shift in posture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with Isaac&#39;s reputation for shrewd negotiations,Luis stillfound himself caught off guard by just how sharp the man was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout their exchange, Isaac cut straight to the heart of every issue, never missing an opportunity to press any advantage he found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he never really thought he could corner lsaac easily,Luis realized just how tough his opponent could be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small, amused smirk played at Luis&#39; lips,his fingers tapping even faster on the armrest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he watched Isaac&#39;s steady calm, a flash of genuine respect crossed Luis&#39; face. It became obvious why Isaac, the eldest Bennett son, had earned such a strong name for himself so early on. The man thrived in this high-stakes world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Luis appreciated that he had never made the mistake of underestimating Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regaining his composure, he lifted his chin and showed not a hint of discomfort after being called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Bennett, you don&#39;t miss a thing,&#34; he remarked,giving a polite nod. &#34;Of course, everyone in business is out for gain. But I&#39;m not here to stir up conflict.What I want is a deal that benefits us both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deal that benefited them both?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s features never softened. His gaze stayed razor -sharp as he leaned back, his words ringing with certainty. &#34;You must know, Mr. Sampson, Bennett Group already sits at the top here in Shoildon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thin smile flickered across lsaac&#39;s lips as he continued, &#34;Why should I split ouradvantage or hand you the chance to profit? I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re really after, and our company only works with partners whose intentions are clear. We build our business on sincerity,not mystery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His message needed no explanation. For Isaac, the conversation had reached its end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis took the rejection in stride, simply watching Isaac in silence. Before either man could say another word,a sudden buzz from Isaac&#39;s phone broke the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That incoming call brought an immediate change to Isaac&#39;s expression, softening the edge that had lingered moments before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glance at the screen caught Luis&#39; attention, and he noticed the contact name: &#34;My Darling Wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac picked up right away, greeted by Verena&#39;s soft,melodic voice. &#34;Honey, what are you up to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound of her voice, all the tension melted from Isaac&#39;s face and a gentle smile appeared.He nearly forgot about his guest, only to catch himself at the last second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed the intercom and gave Jacob clear instructions. &#34;Jacob,please see our visitor out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was so still that Luis could clearly hear the woman&#39;s voice echoing from the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound gave him pause, a flicker of recognition crossing his mind. He couldn&#39;t shake the feeling he&#39;d heard that voice before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brows knitting together, he searched his memory for  the connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could work it out, Jacob appeared by his side,politely gesturing toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapped out of his thoughts, Luis rose to his feet and turned to lsaac. &#34;Mr. Bennett, take some time to consider it. I believe you&#39;l come around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He followed Jacob out,leaving the office behind.</p>
