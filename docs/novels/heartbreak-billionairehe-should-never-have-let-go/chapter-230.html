                <p>Brandon&#39;s mind reeled at the very notion, threatening to shatter his composure entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He refused to accept it-absolutely refused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand, draped carelessly at his side, betrayed him with its subtle tremor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he had first returned from Proidan, shock had numbed him completely, leaving him drowning in a turbulent sea of confusion and rage. But now terror gripped.him with icy fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Real, bone-deep fear consumed every rational thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had accepted Myron&#39;s proposal and they were now engaged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her crystal-cleàr rejection of him, despite</p>
                
                
                
                <p>watching her choose Myron right before his eyes,Brandon still clung to the desperate belief that she belonged to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had secretly secured an apartment in her neighborhood, positioning himself like a phantom observer, confirming that she remained alone-that she hadn&#39;t moved in with Myron yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d whispered reassurances to himself that they were merely dating, that relationships crumbled al the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But an engagement? That changed everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seven years they&#39;d shared together. And those secrets he&#39;d never dared confess to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image of her sleeping peacefully beside another man nearly destroyed what remained of Brandon&#39;s sanity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He squeezed his eyes shut, desperately fighting to banish the torturous vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vehicle glided into the parking structure of a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>towering building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, we just received word that Myron&#39;s vehicle is stationed here, but they haven&#39;t emerged yet.&#34;Darden&#39;s voice dwindled to barely a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engine had died, and their driver had already departed. So why hadn&#39;t they stepped out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were they having some intimate conversation in the parking garage?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden couldn&#39;t bring himself to meet Brandon&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s expression remained perfectly blank, but a soft crack echoed through the silence as his phone screen spider-webbed under the crushing force of his grip. Darden witnessed the destruction and inhaled sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s fury had crushed the device in his bare hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden bit back any further words and gunned the engine toward the coordinates his surveillance team</p>
                
                
                
                <p>had provided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The solitary vehicle waited in the shadows, and Brandon launched himself from the car the instant they stopped, striding directly toward his target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s hand hovered at the car door, uncertainty paralyzing him before he could knock. But fate intervened-the door swung open and Myron stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon seized the moment to peer inside,discovering Millie fast asleep, her body curled against the opposite window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Myron carefully eased the door shut, Brandon spotted the telltale creases on Myron&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that devastating instant, understanding crashed over him like a tidal wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d remained in the parking structure because Millie had drifted off while resting against Myron&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had always struggled with sleep, her traumatic</p>
                
                
                
                <p>past transforming her into the lightest of sleepers.Throughout their years together, Brandon had witnessed her nightmares tear through the darkness on countless occasions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During those dark hours, he would stroke her back with infinite tenderness, whispering reassurances that the past could no longer hurt her, that he stood sentinel over her dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now... she trusted Myron with such complete abandon!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t she terrified of what Myron might attempt while she lay defenseless in slumber?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization sent agony ripping through his chest like shattered glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Myron secured the door, Brandon opened his mouth to speak, but Myron gestured for them to move their conversation elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s glare burned into Myron before shifting to the car where she slept. He gave a curt nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon observed Myron lock the vehicle with meticulous care, safeguarding her sanctuary, before trailing him into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron measured the distance between them and the car with calculating precision, confirming their voices wouldn&#39;t carry back to disturb her rest, and then pivoted to confront Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon met his gaze with arctic coldness, hatred crystallizing in the space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They faced each other in suffocating silence,with Darden maintaining his watchful distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Myron&#39;s fist exploded across Brandon&#39;s face with brutal precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon!&#34; Darden&#39;s shocked cry shattered the stillness as he sprinted forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron refused to relent, seizing Brandon&#39;s collar and slamming him against the concrete wall. His fists hammered down in relentless succession, each blow carrying accumulated rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Brandon absorbed each strike without fightíng back, his body accepting the punishment as if he welcomed the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myron, stop!&#34; Darden lunged between them, his arms wrapping around Myron&#39;s torso as he struggled to pull him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s gotten into you? Why are you beating him senseless?&#34; Darden&#39;s chest heaved with exertion as he struggled to restrain Myron&#39;s muscular frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Release me!&#34; Myron&#39;s command sliced through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Darden&#39;s grip remained ironclad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s head drooped forward, crimson streams painting his lips where Myron&#39;s knuckles had found their mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s laughter rang hollow/and cruel as it echoed off the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze pierced Brandon with arctic coldness as the words poured forth. &#34;Brandon, I used to believe that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>even after falling for Vivian, you&#39;d still harbor some shred of compassion for Millie. How spectacularly wrong I was!&#34; His voice dripped with contempt.&#34;You actually allowed Vivian to broadcast her live stream from the very house you once shared with Millie. You couldn&#39;t even be bothered to remove your wedding photograph or alter a single piece of decor. Now she&#39;s drowning in public ridicule while malicious gossips weave their poisonous theories about you two. Is this the outcome you craved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s eyes transformed into dangerous slits as he delivered each word with calculated precision. &#34;If that&#39;s your truth, then you&#39;ve proven yourself to be absolutely...&#34; He paused, savoring each syllable. &#34;A truly despicable excuse for a man!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fist cocked back for another devastating blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden&#39;s reflexes kicked in, intercepting the attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on...&#34; His voice trembled with urgency.&#34;Brandon had no knowledge of how Vivian infiltrated that house. I&#39;ll stake my reputation on that fact.Originally, Vivian was scheduled to film her broadcast</p>
                
                
                
                <p>from my residence instead. If you had witnessed the live stream, you would have seen Eugene and me breaking down the door to terminate Vivian&#39;s transmission.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s penetrating gaze shifted to Darden, who responded with a solemn nod of confirmation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s eyes narrowed into calculating slits as contemplation consumed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One hand remained trapped in Darden&#39;s grip while the other maintained itsstranglehold on Brandon&#39;s collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, his fingers released their hold on the fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden&#39;s relief lasted mere seconds before Myron&#39;s palm clamped around Brandon&#39;s jaw with renewed fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s skull then connected with the unforgiving wall, the impact reverberating through the parking structure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop this!&#34; Darden surged forward again, but Myron&#39;s free hand pressed against his chest, holding him at bay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron studied Brandon&#39;s battered form with clinical detachment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The damage has already carved its path, and Millie bears every scar.&#34; His voice turned arctic as he pressed closer. &#34;Tell me this-if Vivian had approached you directly, requesting permission to use your villa for her broadcast, would you have granted her wish?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon met his gaze, eyes swimming with blood and anguish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me an answer!&#34; Myron&#39;s demand cracked like a whip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would have refused.&#34; Brandon&#39;s voice emerged as a tortured rasp. &#34;I never intended for her to violate that sacred space with her presence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, he&#39;d never permitted Vivian to cross</p>
                
                
                
                <p>that threshold-not once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, when she&#39;d attempted to deliver flowers to their doorstep, he&#39;d instructed the butler to handle the exchange, barring her from entering their sanctuary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had declared it their home, and he&#39;d honored that designation with religious devotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when Brandon discovered the butler had mistakenly placed those flowers on their dining table,he immediately hurled them into the garbage,erasing every trace of Vivian&#39;s unwelcome intrusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My regret runs deeper than oceans,&#34; Brandon whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears carved silver tracks down his bloodied cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the torturous drive here, the pieces of what had transpired in Crobert during his absence had finally assembled themselves into a devastating picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now he could no longer weave lies to convince</p>
                
                
                
                <p>himself that Vivian possessed even a fragment of genuine kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or perhaps he&#39;d always recognized her true nature but had foolishly believed he could orchestrate every outcome,using self-deception as his shield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t bind yourself to her through engagement.Don&#39;t choose a future with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s plea carried the weight of his shattered soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myron. Please...&#34; His voice cracked like breaking glass. &#34;Give her back to me.&#34;</p>
