                <p>Calm and unruffled, Millie stood her ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fixing her eyes on Vivian, she spoke without hesitation. &#34;If your big idea for this live stream was to parade my old house and dredge up pieces of my past just to rattle me, you&#39;ve got it all wrong. Honestly, I find it pretty sad. I regret nothing I&#39;ve done, and I&#39;m not ashamed of loving someone who turned out to be the wrong choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a deliberate gesture, she indicated the two new photo frames beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued, &#34;My marriage to Brandon and our divorce-they&#39;re both public knowledge. Everyone in Crobert knows my story. I don&#39;t have anything to cover up or pretend about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian went pale, her eyes filling with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never meant it like that,&#34; Vivian protested, her voice wavering. &#34;You&#39;ve got it all wrong, Millie. I&#39;m just here to live stream, that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight smile crossed Millie&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, have l?&#34; she replied quietly, her eyes driftingto the stream&#39;s chat.&#34;YOUu picked the day, you picked the spot, you chose exactly what to show, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian jumped in. &#34;It just happened like this. All of it. Pure chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie echoed the word with disbelief. &#34;Pure chance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile sharpened, tinged with irony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t need to spell it out any further. The comments flying across the live stream spoke volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody watching the livestream was buying the coincidence excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had already spelled out that Vivian called every shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Elliott Group&#39;s product launch had been planned and announced far in advance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppose the timing lined up by accident, but what about the location?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone remembered Vivian&#39;s live stream wasn&#39;t supposed to take place here at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,Vivian insisted it was all a fluke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if the original venue fell through, there was no explaining why Vivian went to Millie and Brandon&#39;s old home and kept the camera focused on their wedding photo still hanging on the wall.④</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was also the one who started the live link right then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One or two lucky breaks might slip by, but after a while, the setup was too obvious. Vivian&#39;s choices were obviously intentional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coincidence didn&#39;t cut it anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, whether it was the wedding portrait left untouched or the suspicious decor of the bathroom,the message behind was clear-Millie and Brandon had genuinely loved eachother once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had been no betrayal. No outsider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their marriage had been real-recognized by the law, embraced by their families, and celebrated for what it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville&#39;s team stepped in1, bringing up what Millie herself would never say out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any real product comparison should actually spotlight the product-like how Millie&#39;s streams always focus on the Golden collection. Even if there&#39;s a marketing stunt involved, it all boils down to what&#39;s being sold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian tried to pitch her stream as an exploration of luxury floral design, yet the camera lingered on Millie and Brandon&#39;s wedding photo, and she couldn&#39;t resist taking a peek into their bathroom. The flowers barely got a mention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ef&#39;ve caught Vivian&#39;s other home tours and floral arrangement vlogs before. She never behaved this way in those videos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s obvious. She&#39;s clinging to Millie&#39;s name just to pull her down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of this comeback had been planned through a quick phone call from Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had been given more chances than she deserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Messages flooded the chat, each one zipping past faster than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fans who&#39;d once felt betrayed by Vivian on Heavenly Melody finally found their voices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos erupted in the livestreamn room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t bother reacting to the disorder on Vivian&#39;s end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A serene smile on her face, she turned her attention to the people gathered in person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for waiting. Let&#39;s keep going. Our final stop is just ahead,&#34; she announced, her tone warm and inviting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one needed to be asked twice. The group, satisfied with what they&#39;d seen, eagerly followed her lead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A light breeze flicked through the air, causing the prop documents to flutter open and expose the pages inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There weren&#39;t any specific details printed on them, just two unmistakable names.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie Bennett. Brandon Watson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stamped boldly across the marriage certificate prop-&#34;CANCELLED.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The divorce certificate, meanwhile, stood as a symbol of Millie&#39;s fresh start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie was already leading the group onward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Vivian was floundering, struggling to regain her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate for attention,she faked a bout of weakness, coughing in front of the camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the ploy only made things worse for her this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re feeling that unwell, there&#39;s really no reason to push yourself in a contest like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. We keep cutting her slack because she claims to be sick. Millie never uses health as an excuse for sympathy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These remarks were quickly lost in the sea of comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears brimmed in Vivian&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gazed into the camera, a single tear slipping down and landing right inside the vase she clutched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly turned away, brushing the tear off her cheek before anyone could see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her gaze, Vivian looked as fragile as ever. &#34;I know nothing I say will change a thing. Simply by showing up here, I become the villain. It feels like even my existing is a mistake at this point.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Millie guided the group onward, bringing them into the next exhibit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This space symbolized everything about the present moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A Polaroid camera sat nearby, waiting to snap new memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sweeping golden river cut through the center, echoing the gemstone motif from the previous hall. Now,golden grains formed little beaches and jagged rock islands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scattered across the sand and stone, golden picture frames peeked out through wisps of river mist, lending the whole scene an air of wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each frame, unique in design and shape, stood ready with wide open space. Arranged before every frame,the latest pieces from the Golden series sparkled in the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right as Millie was explaining the collection, Vivian&#39;s voice broke through.&#34;Millie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned toward the streaming device.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had fashioned a fresh bouquet, ready for the camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are Renoir&#39;s Roses,&#34; she said, her face still stained with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie fixed Vivian with a steady look, saying nothing as she waited for her to go on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined, Vivian swept away her tears with the back of her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your opinion doesn&#39;t matter to me,&#34; she insisted. &#34;None of what you accused me of was ever on my mind.I really never meant to hurt you. People kept urging me to check out the master bedroom, but I wouldn&#39;t do it.That was my way of showing you respect,&#34; Vivian added,her lips pushed out in a small pout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not so much as a flicker crossed Millie&#39;s face. &#34;And then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s tears started to flow again. &#34;Then I see that being kind is pointless with you. People are still convinced I&#39;m here to attack you.&#34; Sniffling, Vivian dabbed at her eyes. &#34;Fine, then. I&#39;ll just go anyway!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurt pride and defiance warred in her tone, as though Millie had pushed her to this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short, amused laugh escaped Millie at the display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I asked you not to go, would that actually stop you? Drop the act, Vivian. If you want to wander in, then just do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian didn&#39;t know how to respond after Millie&#39;s blunt words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; she stuttered, at a loss for anything else to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing not to acknowledge Vivian, Millie pressed on, talking about the new collection to her group with barely a pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Viewers watching the stream couldn&#39;t help but burst into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie&#39;s got some serious backbone,&#34; someone commented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping her gaze fixed on the floor, Vivian masked the bitterness brewing inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a message came through-Eugene and Darden had arrived outside the villa. Her security team still held the entrance, but they were running out of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to act fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to back down, Vivian muttered, &#34;You can&#39;t keep me out of the master bedroom just by telling me to stay away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie, you&#39;ve set upo surprises for the launch. What&#39;s next? I can&#39;t wait tofind out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Receiving no answer, she watched as Millie finished her product presentation, unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, Vivian picked up her bouquet and headed straight for the master bedroom, determined to see the place Millie and Brandon once shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, Millie placed a call. &#34;It&#39;s time, Myron,&#34; she said, a satisfied smile lighting her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere beyond the villa, the distant whir of helicopter blades drifted closer, growing louder by the second.</p>
