                <p>Millie had absorbed countless lessons from her father,yet they represented merely a whisper of his vast knowledge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her father wielded an unshakeable composure, as though every thread of fate danced within his grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless of how desperate circumstances became,he wielded an uncanny ability to discover unexpected pathways toward the most favorable resolutions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His presence alone served as an impenetrable shield -no one would dare harass Millie while he drew breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None possessed the courage, because back then, she was James&#39; sole daughter, the destined heiress of the illustrious Bennett legacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But death had stolen her father away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had plunged from that towering edifice,his body crashing to the pavement directly before her horrified eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His departure struck with brutal swiftness, and he departed this world without achieving serenity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That nightmarish image carved itself into her memory,jolting her awake from sleep after sleep, drenched in cold sweat and gasping for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s fingers curled into a trembling fist, her knuckles whitening with determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would reclaim every asset that rightfully belonged to the Bennett empire and drag the truth about her father&#39;s murder into the harsh light of justice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to succeed-failure wasn&#39;t an option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Watson Group&#39;s stock value began its gradual ascent from the depths. Though the numbers still glowed crimson with loss, the devastating free-fall had finally stabilized into a more manageable decline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strategic public announcements followed in rapid succession,each carefully crafted statement breathing new life into investor confidence. The stock price found its footing on steadier ground. Most remarkably,not a single major partner had severed ties with the Watson Group during this turbulent period,demonstrating remarkable loyalty that convinced many analysts the stock would eventually surge back to its former heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours melted away, and soon the midday trading bell silenced the markets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Financial experts seized the moment to dissect the unfolding drama for their eager audiences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Currently, the Watson Group&#39;s products,manufacturing standards, and business relationships appear completely sound. This publicly traded corporation clearly possesses its own methods for navigating turbulent waters. Nevertheless, I remain deeply intrigued about their strategy for addressing Vivian&#39;s explosive allegations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m eager to interview Brandon&#39;s former wife, Millie.After all, she weathered seven tumultuous years alongside the Watson Group and witnessed previous stock market earthquakes. I&#39;m fascinated to discover how they navigated those earlier storms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the captivated spectators found themselves utterly absorbed by Vivian&#39;s explosive livestream revelations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian claimed she and Brandon never shared physical intimacy. Could that possibly be accurate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nobody can say for certain at this point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Vivian&#39;s testimony proves accurate and they maintained a purely platonic relationship, then  perhaps she isn&#39;t the home-wrecker we imagined-just someone who made unreasonable demands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what about Brandon&#39;s cryptic response? He admitted it before that there were feelings between him and Vivian. Is that mere gratitude? Maybe appreciation? Either way, it feels deliberately vague and evasive, yet it practically confirmed he divorced Millie because of this entire mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly my thoughts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m dying to see how this soap opera reaches its grand finale.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, after wrestling with an avalanche of corporate crises, Brandon found himself facing Eugene&#39;s simple question about lunch preferences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But hunger had abandoned Brandon entirely, leaving him feeling hollow and restless. He mumbled something about wanting to stretch his legs downstairs and told Eugene to order whatever seemed appealing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene opened his mouth to protest, but then thought better of it and simply clamped his lips shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant had endured his own hellish day. After sacrificing sleep to navigate the company&#39;s treacherous waters, Vivian&#39;s theatrical performance had driven him perilously close to his breaking point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,since Brandon had granted him carte blanche for meal selection, Eugene decided to indulge in something luxuriously expensive that would satisfy his own refined tastes-two servings, one designated for Brandon and one for himself. Should Brandon&#39;s appetite fail to materialize, he would savor both servings with guilty pleasure!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon summoned his private elevator with a weary press of the button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gleaming doors slid open with mechanical precision, and after a moment of internal debate, his finger hovered over a specific floor selection before pressing down with quiet resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ding.&#34; The elevator completed its swift journey and announced its arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon emerged from the compartment without making a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This particular floor buzzed with frenetic energy-employees juggling phone calls while weaving between workstations, their voices creating a symphony of professional stress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several employees offered respectful greetings as he passed, though most remained completely absorbed in their critical tasks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The constant symphony of ringing telephones echoed throughout the entire workspace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This floor served as the nerve center for the company&#39;s market value management operations,while directly across the corridor stood the prestigious financial department that the Bennett family had established during their golden years of influence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every soul in sight moved with urgent purpose,their dedication palpable in the charged atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brandon observed their relentless activity, Millie&#39;s ethereal presence seemed to materialize before his weary eyes like a phantom from happier times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had once graced these corridors frequently,weaving her strategic brilliance behind the scenes with masterful precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question tormented him-had she witnessed today&#39;s explosive news coverage?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had observed his clumsy attempts at damnage control, what harsh judgment would she render?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon found himself drowning in these troubling  thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a darker realization struck him with crushing force.Millie had probably witnessed Vivian&#39;s livestream spectacle instead of his corporate maneuvering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His frustration blazed hotter, consuming what remained of his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps she would find dark amusement in watching him stumble through such a seemingly straightforward crisis after her departure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind drifted unbidden to those precious nights when nightmares would tear her from sleep, and she would seek sanctuary in his embrace while he whispered gentle reassurances against her trembling form until their hearts beat in perfect synchronization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ache of missing her struck his stomach like a physical blow, sharp and unrelenting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, what brings you to this chaos? Shouldn&#39;t you be heading to lunch?&#34; A familiar voice sliced through his melancholic reverie and pulled him back to harsh reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gathered his scattered composure and turned to find Babette approaching with quick, efficient strides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are things progressing with the current situation?&#34;Brandon deflected, steering the conversation toward safer professional territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette&#39;s expression curdled with disgust, her features contorting as though she had just swallowed something utterly vile and bitter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thestock price has achieved temporary stability,but...&#34;Babette&#39;s gaze met Brandon&#39;s before she allowed her words to trail into meaningful silence,the unspoken implications hanging heavy between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s reckless theatrics had created a huge mess,and now even Babette&#39;s closest friends were openly mocking her and the Watson Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing compares to how smoothly everything operated when Millie held the reins here,&#34; someone whispered from a nearby workstation, giving voice to Babette&#39;s private thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Babette adamantly refused to concede this painful truth and simply waved the speaker away with an irritated gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she turned back to continue their conversation,Brandon had already vanished without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After wandering the floor aimlessly, Brandon&#39;s mood had plummeted to even greater depths of despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon returning to the sanctuary of his executive office,he gazed at the untouched meal sitting on his  polished desk, but his appetite remained completely absent. He waved the food away with a dismissive gesture. &#34;Please remove this immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene&#39;s lips curved into a mysteriously satisfied grin.&#34;Certainly,Mr.Watson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, across the city, a gentle knock echoed through Millie&#39;s modest rented office space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her gaze from the scattered documents before her to find Giffard&#39;s reassuring silhouette framed in her doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Giffard.&#34; Millie acknowledged him with genuine pleasure brightening her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giffard stepped across the threshold and presented her with a lunch bag that emanated tantalizing aromas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I reasoned that you must be completely overwhelmed with work today, so l decided to bring you something delicious since my travels brought me through your neighborhood.&#34; He opened each container with practiced care and arranged the various dishes across an empty table with meticulous attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The spread included several perfectly prepared entrees accompanied by a steaming bowl of aromatic soup,all maintaining their ideal serving temperature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This looks absolutely divine!&#34; Millie exclaimed,her stomach responding immediately to the enticing aromas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, enjoy every bite,&#34; Giffard encouraged with paternal fondness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re incredibly thoughtful-thank you so much.&#34;Millie beamed at him, her memory stirring with thoughts of the Hussain family&#39;s recently hired chef,whose culinary skills seemed legendary among their social circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My pleasure entirely.&#34; Giffard nodded graciously,his expression brightening as Millie gestured for him to join her feast. &#34;I&#39;ve already satisfied my hunger. Please,proceed without any concern for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie lifted the soup to her lips and savored the first warming sip of the soup with closed eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This captures exactly the flavors I crave most!&#34; she declared with heartfelt enthusiasm,fixing Giffard with an intense gaze. &#34;Should your talented chef ever consider new employment opportunities, you absolutely must provide me with the first introduction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giffard&#39;s eyes reflected her infectious joy as his smile broadened with genuine warmth. &#34;I give you my solemn promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While observing Millie savor her meal with obvious delight, Giffard shifted to more serious matters. &#34;In approximately six weeks, an important academic conference will convene in Flaville, and my attendance has been confirmed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie paused mid-bite, her attention focusing entirely on Giffard while waiting for him to elaborate on this intriguing development.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve enlisted several trusted colleagues in Flaville to investigate Vivian&#39;s medical history more thoroughly Unfortunately, the medical institution maintains extremely strict confidentiality protocols and refuses to divulge patient information under normal circumstances-which,I suppose you&#39;ve already learnt from Charles since he&#39;s been helping you look into this.&#34; Giffard&#39;s tone grew more determined. &#34;When I travel there for the conference however, I plan to visit that facility personally and conduct some subtle investigations. Hope I can uncover information that might prove useful to your cause.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie regarded Giffard with profound gratitude shining in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had shared her childhood years with Alexia, and throughout those formative years, Giffard had protected her with the devotion of a caring older brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart had always recognized him in that cherished familial role, filling a void she had carried since childhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you from the depths of my heart, Giffard.&#34;Millie spoke with absolute sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gratitude remains unnecessary between us,&#34; Giffard responded, his hand settling gently on her head with brotherly affection.</p>
