                <p>App after app, Millie methodically scrolled through the music platforms on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her curiosity led her to the search engine, where she discovered a dedicated Wikipedia page for the new release.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s name showed up in every spot. She was listed as the lyricist, the composer, and the performer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet laugh escaped Millie as she set her phone aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian wasn&#39;t afraid to take risks and didn&#39;t try to hide it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If there had been recent negotiations with Evans Entertainment, Charles would have found out immediately. He followed these things closely, and so did Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reality, however, told a different story. Vivian had never reached out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Charles&#39; notoriously short temper and his zero tolerance for unfairness, there was no way he would have let this go unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Vivian truly missed that point?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she just didn&#39;t care about Evans Entertainment&#39;s stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps she believed Brandon could fix anything that might come up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or, given that her days were numbered, she simply had nothing left to lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in these questions, Millie suddenly heard a quiet sniffle beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning, she caught sight of Barbara hastily dabbing at her cheeks with a tissue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Barbara noticed Millie looking, she explained, her voice breaking, &#34;Gosh, I couldn&#39;t help it. This song just hit me so hard. Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to compliment the competition so much... oh, right,Vivian&#39;s not a contestant. She&#39;s a guest judge. I&#39;m all mixed up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crying had left the poor assistant flustered and a little embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie couldn&#39;t help but find her adorable, so she offered another tissue, her voice gentle. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. Honestly, I think the song is beautiful too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, the music was her own creation to begin with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of relief washed over Barbara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Onstage, Vivian&#39;s performance reached its end.Tears streaked her face as the cameras lingered,capturing a portrait of both vulnerability and strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick camera sweep brought the audience&#39;s attention straight to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His seat had been carefully chosen, providing him with both an excellent view and a sense of seclusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Few people in the crowd had actually spotted him,despite the persistent rumors swirling about his attendance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the moment the broadcast panned away from the stage, Brandon&#39;s presence was impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A close-up filled the screen, capturing him in crisp detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every part of him looked composed. His tailored suit showed off his slim frame, and not one movement gave away a hint of nerves. He carried himself with calm confidence and a kind of ease that didn&#39;t need any show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his hands rested with casual ease, anyone watching closely might have caught a faint redness around his eyes, which could have been the lights or something more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reaction online was explosive, with messages and squeals filling the comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god, it&#39;s really Mr.Watson!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s something about Mr. Watson today/. He looks more striking than usual.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He never goes to these things! He&#39;s only here because of Vivian-if that&#39;s not love, what is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those red eyes say it all! Vivian&#39;s performance must have touched him deeply.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m obsessed! Their romance is the stuff of dreams!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, you can&#39;t hide anymore. Come and deal with this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A graceful bow from Vivian drew the audience&#39;s gaze back to the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brushed the tears away from her eyes, her features softening into something gentle and beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you all-especially that special someone in my life,&#34; Vivian whispered, her words directed both to the audience and to a certain someone she never named, her smile gentle but secretive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No matter how short my days may be, or how hard the road ahead gets, your presence makes me fearless,&#34; she remarked as the stage lights lifted,filling the space with a sense of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still wiping at his own tears, the host returned to center stage. &#34;Vivian, that performance was incredible. The entire audience is moved! Can you tell us-who is that special someone you mentioned?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s response was only a smile, her silence more telling than words, and the cameras lingered for a moment before cutting back to Brandon, letting the mystery linger in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few light words were exchanged before Vivian left the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The spotlight soon shifted as contestants prepared for their performances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the first singer wrapping up, a call came for Millie to get ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Down the backstage hallway, Millie made her way forward and unexpectedly crossed paths with Vivian,who had just come from a conversation with Brandon in the audience and was heading backstage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their steps slowed as they neared one another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Serena,&#34; Vivian then called out, catching Millie&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s steps faltered for a brief moment as she glanced toward Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bright smile played across Vivian&#39;s lips. &#34;Did yoLI enjoy it? My performance, I mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soft laughter escaped Millie. &#34;The song was wonderful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s smile grew wider. &#34;I believe my song should prove my talent to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a silent laugh came from Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words kept flowing from Vivian. &#34;Later on, when teams are formed, would you consider joining mine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day marked the premiere of the show, which introduced both contestants and judges to the audience and included a segment for forming teams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four contestants would be chosen by each of the three judges, with mutual selection taking place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A question lingered on Millie&#39;s lips. &#34;I have not even performed yet, and you are already offering? What if I ruin your team&#39;s chances?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian responded with confidence, &#34;I expect you to pick me, since we share a common adversary.&#34; She stepped in, closing the space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice dropped as she leaned in and whispered,&#34;Serena,have you ever wondered why you cannot be Charles&#39; official girlfriend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A puzzled lift of Millie&#39;s brow revealed her confusion at Vivian&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words-&#34;Charles&#39; girlfriend&#34;?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Vivian really talking about her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pleased with Millie&#39;s reaction, Vivian leaned back.&#34;There is someone standing in your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A question came without hesitation. &#34;Who?&#34; Millie wanted to know what game Vivian was playing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s smile grew wider as she slowly opened her mouth and said, &#34;It&#39;s Millie Bennett. She&#39;s the one、standing in your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion filled Millie&#39;s eyes as she stared at Vivian,lost for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick adjustment of posture followed from Vivian.&#34;You may doubt it now, but one day you will see that l am telling the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she prepared to leave, Vivian&#39;s gaze dropped pointedly to Millie&#39;s stomach and she spoke again.&#34;It must be agony to lose a child, am I right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian left those words hanging in the air and walked away,her silence cutting deeper than anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Down the hall, staff members called out for Millie,urging her to hurry along, so she moved on without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few paces later, Vivian glanced over her shoulder,her expression one of triumph as she watched Millie walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every bit of her timing was intentional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had carefully picked this very moment to reveal this &#34;secret&#34; to Serena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first goal was clear. Vivian wanted to cloud Serena&#39;s thoughts and make her falter on stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had been no rehearsal attendance from Serena. Vivian could not judge the girl&#39;s talent, nor had she sent anyone to test her. Most likely, Serena did not even know the competition&#39;s rules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night was meant to be Vivian&#39;s triumph, and she was determined to shine brighter than anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second reason burned beneath the surface.Vivian aimed to plant resentment for Millie in the heart of Serena, the woman Charles kept at his side but never made official.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain must have been lingered from losing a child for Charles, only to remain unrecognized by him.Surely Serena must harbor suspicions or feel bitterness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If any anger existed, Vivian wanted it aimed squarely at Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her goal was to use this woman as a weapon against Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking through each step, Vivian found no fault in her plan. A sense of satisfaction washed over her as she turned away and moved backstage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the end of the corridor, Millie paused, her eyes following Vivian&#39;s fading figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, in a dimly lit monitoring room, two people listened intently as the recording from the &#34;Backstage Corridor&#34; device played, their eyes round with shock. A whisper broke the silence. &#34;Do you think we should tell someone about this?&#34;</p>
