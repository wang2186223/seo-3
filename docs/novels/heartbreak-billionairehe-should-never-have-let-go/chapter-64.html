                <p>Once Vivian was safely dropped at her door, Brandon drifted through the city on his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every glimpse of neon and the restless swirl of strangers outside sparked a tangled ache inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the window, he watched the pale glow of streetlights and the endless flow of cars, feeling strangely apart from all the city&#39;s noise and movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden vibration in his pocket then interrupted his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at the screen, Brandon spotted an incoming call from an old friend-Darden Harris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered with a simple, &#34;Yeah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Darden didn&#39;t waste time. &#34;Feel like grabbing a drink? I&#39;m at Blue Lounge. Unless you&#39;ve got plans with Vivian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their friendship went all the way back to childhood, so Brandon gave a quick nod to his driver and told him to switch directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be there,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bentley glided through Crobert&#39;s busy streets, making its way to Blue Lounge, the city&#39;s most popular night spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Navigating through the bustling crowd, Brandon eventually arrived at Darden&#39;s private suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle frown crept across his face as he stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place buzzed with laughter and voices, a lively mix of men and women-Darden clearly intent on throwing a party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, you made it!&#34; Darden called out, pulling him into a boisterous hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hint of reluctance, Brandon allowed himself to be led further in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising his glass for attention, Darden declared,&#34;Everyone, meet my oldest friend Brandon Watson-he&#39;s the one who runs the Watson Group now! Let&#39;s hear it for him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tipsiness was obvious, and the crowd responded with eager applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s face was a familiar one in Crobert;recognition flashed instantly in the eyes of half the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise grated on him, so he quietly motioned for the hangers-on to clear out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than take offense, Darden just grinned and waved for everyone but the two of them to file out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the room had emptied, the two sat on the sofa,Darden pouring a generous drink for his friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon studied the liquid glinting in the low light before taking a measured sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s life been treating you?&#34; Darden asked,settling in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering right away, Brandon let his head rest against the back of the sofa, his featuresslipping into shadow where Darden couldn&#39;t read them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of responding directly, Brandon broke the silence with his own question. &#34;What about you?Anything new?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden let out a sharp laugh, swiping at his eyes before draining another mouthful of liquor.&#34;Oh,you know-family drama on repeat. There&#39;s always some issue cropping up. And would you believe it, Alyssa just dumped me. Said I&#39;m &#39;damaged goods&#39; now and wants nothing to do with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed in exasperation. &#34;Honestly, I don&#39;t get her logic. Sure, I&#39;ve been around other females, but it&#39;s always business. Dad needed me to show the McCoy family&#39;s daughter around town; was I supposed to say no?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon traced circles in his glass, only half-engaged in Darden&#39;s tale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, he suggested, &#34;Maybe you&#39;re sending mixed signals without realizing it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden rolled his eyes and topped off Brandon&#39;s glass,refusing to let the subject drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I hear you, Mr. CEO,&#34; he teased. &#34;Guess I should take notes-stick with one woman at a time like you did. First Millie, and now Vivian. Loyal as ever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jab struck a nerve. Brandon&#39;s annoyance showed as he motioned for Darden to put the bottle down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That only seemed to amuse Darden more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re upset?&#34; Darden grinned, settling back with a look of mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t take it the wrong way. Honestly, I admire you.I wish I could say the same for myself,&#34; he added,setting his glass aside and slumping into the couch.&#34;You&#39;ve done more than rescue your family&#39;s business -you&#39;ve actually made it stronger. And on the personal side, Millie would have gone through hell for you. Now you&#39;re with Vivian, and, at least from what l heard,she seems genuinely good. Meanwhile, me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With shadows flickering across his features, Darden&#39;s expression stayed hidden from view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I may have inherited the company, but there&#39;s always another crisis knocking at the door. Alyssa and I have been together forever, yet now she can&#39;t even stand to look at  me-and nothing I say seems to matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes I wish I had your kind of freedom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice lingered in the quiet,echoing faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s gaze dropped, tracing the slow orbit of melting ice in his glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Freedom? Was that really what his life looked like?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, tell me-what&#39;s the deal with you, Millie, and Vivian?&#34; Darden changed course, curiosity sharp in his tone. &#34;I&#39;ve seen some posts online, but it&#39;s impossible to keep track of your story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re going through a divorce, Millie and I,&#34; Brandon replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re kidding me!&#34; The answer jolted Darden upright,the light finally revealing his stunned face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For Vivian? Are you serious?&#34; Darden blurted out,his disbelief unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon raised his glass, taking a slow sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A simple &#34;Yes,&#34; was his answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden shook his head, setting his own drama aside for the moment. &#34;I don&#39;t get it. You and Millie always seemed rock solid-looked happy, even. And Vivian...isn&#39;t she terminally ill? I figured you were just being kind to her, nothing more. Plus,is Millie really fine with this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon kept his eyes on the slow swirl of ice, not bothering to meet Darden&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She gave her consent,&#34; Brandon replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way,&#34; Darden said, springing to his feet and pacing the length of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Genuine confusion clouded his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you telling me she&#39;s just letting you go? I remember how she handled that PR disaster with that pretty executive from the vendor company-remember? You ignored the woman, but she kept trying to get close, even showed off in front of Millie.Next thing I knew, Millie made sure that woman knew her place. She was so angry with you after,she wouldn&#39;t even talk to you for days,&#34; Darden continued,lost in the memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The recollection came back to Brandon vividly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all a misunderstanding-he&#39;d never shown interest in the woman, but his silence had been misread,and she ended up provoking Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could still see Millie&#39;s expression as she hurled the folder at the woman, telling her in no uncertain terms that anyone who didn&#39;t put business first had no place working with Watson Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same evening, when Brandon reached for her, most she shoved him away with a fierce glare, stubbornness radiating from every inch of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took what felt like forever before her anger finally began to fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only once she&#39;d cooled did she lay things out for him.&#34;Brandon, I&#39;m willing to compromise on business, but never on love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was even clearer before the night ended. &#34;I love you,Brandon-more than anything. But I can&#39;t share your heart. If someone else ever takes my place in your heart...&#34; The determination in her eyes was unmistakable when she added, &#34;I&#39;ll walk away,no matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s fingers tightened around the glass, knuckles white, before he forced himself to loosen his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, she was always glued to you-never more than a little sulk when she got upset. It doesn&#39;t add up.I don&#39;t see how she could actually let go,&#34; Darden murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of heaviness washed over Brandon as he closed his eyes, the past pressing in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seven years had passed, and yet she&#39;d never managed to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, she&#39;d even started handling things with care, choosing not to stir up unnecessary conflict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought sent Brandon reaching for his glass,draining it in one swallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drinks kept coming that evening, but a subtle,persistent unease settled in the back of his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, when morning came, Brandon brushed off the discomfort and dove back into his daily routine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything slipped into a comfortable rhythm, until a news report shattered the calm-</p>
