                <p>Millie and Myron had no idea the Internet had erupted with the headline-&#34;Myron Elliott unleashes blue rain to win over a mystery woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attached image was nothing short of cinematic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pair of silhouettes stood close together beneath a curtain of luminous blue rain, the woman&#39;s elegant hand outstretched to catch the falling drops while Myron lingered at her side, his body turned protectively toward her, his lips curved into a warm,private smile meant only for the woman beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s broad shoulders concealed most of her face,making her identity impossible to guess, but the breeze caught the hem of her flowing blue dress and sent her hair streaming behind her, capturing a snapshot of effortless intimacy beneath the wash of cool color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second,even clearer photo immediately followed,this one alive with movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blue rain shimmered in midair; the woman&#39;s graceful arm reached up, skin gleaming under the city lights, as Myron looked down at her with unmistakable affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Captivated, she took in the brilliant spectacle he&#39;d crafted for her alone, as he watched her closely, his love shining plainly in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online gossip swirled, everyone desperate to unmask the enigmatic woman who&#39;d captured Myron&#39;s attention-a feat in itself, since he was notorious for being impervious to romantic intrigue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the while, the blue rain kept falling, drenching the world in surreal color as Millie studied the vivid droplets streaking across her palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a broad, warm hand appeared, gently pressing a soft, damp cloth against her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up in surprise as Myron meticulously wiped each of her fingers, erasing every last trace of blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finished, he set the cloth aside and threaded his fingers firmly through hers, his grip both reassuring and deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie caught sight of their entwined hands but made no move to break away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come with me,&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he guided her across the rain-  slicked lawn to a waiting pavilion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the endless blue rain, he finally let go of her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Music floated through the air-soft, romantic,utterly inviting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flourish, Myron bowed to her, a playful spark in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;May I have this dance?&#34; he asked, offering his hand with a hopeful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something unnamable stirred in Millie&#39;s chest-an emotion that made her heart beat strangely fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d like that,&#34; she replied, steadying her voice as she slipped her hand into his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers closed around hers with quiet confidence,and then settled at her waist, guiding her effortlessly across the pavilion&#39;s polished floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Light glimmered from above, casting a delicate glow over their entwined figures. She laid her free hand gently on his shoulder and tilted her chin, meeting his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled down at her, yet his eyes seemed to hold an entire world she suddenly longed to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beyond the pavilion, blue rain poured in silver sheets,while inside, a lamp spilled warm light across the polished floor, stretching their shadows until they nearly touched the far walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soft, lilting music played as they turned together,each careful step drawing them closer in the hush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tranquil, almost dreamlike intimacy enveloped them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stray breeze teased a strand of Millie&#39;s hair, and the faint trace of her perfume drifted between them,making Myron&#39;s gaze sharpen with something unspoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her eyes, drawn in by the darkness in his gaze.Something inside her fluttered. Millie&#39;s attention trailed along the strong lines of his face-those thoughtful eyes, the defined nose, the faint curve of his lips-until her courage faltered and she looked away,pulse quickening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have we met before?&#34; she ventured quietly,letting her hand settle with gentle familiarity on his shoulder.Her tone was searching, almost hopeful.&#34;I mean,not at work-somewhere else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, knowing smile touched Myron&#39;s lips. &#34;We have,&#34;he answered, his voice rich and mellow. &#34;But only in passing. I doubt I made much of an impression back then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie dipped her head, lashes fluttering as she smiled back. &#34;I see,&#34; she murmured, unable to hide the hint of curiosity in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment&#39;s hesitation, she queried, &#34;Can you tell me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron let out a low laugh, warmth glinting in his eyes.&#34;If I tried to list them all, we&#39;d be here all night. Maybe I should save the details for our next weekly check-ins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his head, his tone teasing. &#34;How does that sound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave a soft nod, catching his meaning and letting the question drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the last notes of the waltz drifted through the air,their steps slowed to a gentle halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two stood beneath the pavilion&#39;s shelter, face-to -face, the hush between them unexpectedly intimate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a few lingering heartbeats, neither spoke, the moment stretching, charged with an odd, fluttery tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Millie couldn&#39;t help it-she burst out laughing, her voice ringing in the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron laughed along, their joy spilling out until they both bent over, breathless and grinning</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Myron caught Millie just in time, steadying her before her ankle could twist in her high heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A playful smile lingered as he nodded toward a shaded table nearby. &#34;Come on. Let&#39;s catch our breath over there. I&#39;ve got some cocktails with barely any alcohol -thought we could just relax and watch the waves for a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds perfect.&#34; Millie brushed away lingering tears of laughter, letting the last giggle fade as she joined him at the table. She lifted a glass, sipped cautiously,and let out a quiet sigh when she tasted how light it really was. Leaning back against the pavilion rail,they both let the salty air and low, murmured conversation fill the space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far away, two undercover paparazzi-dressed as servers-could only stare,utterly floored by the scene unfolding before them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their hands hovered uncertainly over their cameras,eyes flickering between the relaxed couple and each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a beat, one of them broke the silence. &#34;Unless my eyes are playing tricks on me, that&#39;s Millie with Myron,isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To seal the confirmation, he added, &#34;Millie Bennett-the woman who finalized her divorce from Brandon only days ago!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another, gripping his camera with shaking hands,nodded so fast he nearly dropped it. &#34;Swear on my life,that&#39;s her. No mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thin sheen of sweat shone on his brow as he glanced at the camera&#39;s screen, heart pounding. &#34;And we&#39;ve got the shots.Full proof. Should we-should we ask if they want to buy them off? If they do, this could be huge!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a shaky step forward, intending to approach Myron,but the more composed one grabbed his arm.&#34;Don&#39;t even think about it. They&#39;re clearly on a date. If you barge in, Myron might actually kill you. Here&#39;s what we&#39;ll do: post a teaser-just a few photos where Millie&#39;s face isn&#39;t visible. Let people know we&#39;ve got something big. Then reach out to Jayceon and see if he wants to negotiate. I&#39;m sure the Elliott family already knows what&#39;s up. If Jayceon can&#39;t make the call, we&#39;ll approach Myron tomorrow. But whatever you do, do not interrupt them tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other one nodded, swallowing again as tension buzzed between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, a short video surfaced online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under a pavilion draped in blue rain, Myron and a woman swayed together, the music casting a dreamy spell over the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The camera angle kept her face hidden, but her smooth skin, elegant silhouette, and effortless dance moves left no doubt she was stunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, it was Myron&#39;s mesmerized stare that stole the spotlight-he looked at her as if he couldn&#39;t see anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Internet erupted again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated viewers cursed the pillar that blocked her face-&#34;Would someone please move that column already?&#34;-while gossip forums lit up with theories.&#34;Who is she? What kind of woman could enchant Myron like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As speculation exploded online, Brandon&#39;s phone started buzzing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced down at the screen-a message from Darden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myron and his mystery girlfriend are all over the news!You have to see this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden had fired off several gossip links in their chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s mind flashed back to his last run-in with Myron at the mall, recalling every word of that tense conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tapped the links, scrolling through the trending hashtags, vivid paparazzi shots, and a short video clip of Myron and the woman twirling through the blue rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint frown creased his brow. There was something eerily familiar about the way the woman moved,the graceful curve of her figure-almost as if he&#39;d seen her somewhere before.</p>
