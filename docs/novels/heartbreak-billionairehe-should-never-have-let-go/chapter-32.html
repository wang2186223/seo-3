                <p>The wind raced through the trees and carried echoes that felt like old memories refusing to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A handful of leaves drifted down, barely touching the earth.Brandon,growing impatient with Millie&#39;s silence,pressed her for an answer. &#34;Come on. I asked you a question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie fixed her eyes on Brandon&#39;s shadow stretching out along the ground. &#34;You really ought to ask Vivian about what she said to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of doubt crept into Brandon&#39;s expression.&#34;Vivian has never even met you before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He meant that she was inventing stories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie raised her head and met his gaze. &#34;Mr. Watson,do you truly put all your faith in her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Brandon was quiet, but that old,strange feeling stirred in him once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added, &#34;There&#39;s nothing for me to gain by going after Vivian. She&#39;s important to you, and with your influence in Crobert, someone like me could never match up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile played on her lips. &#34;If nothing really happened, why would I put myself in such a difficult position for no reason at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s frown grew more pronounced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He realized her argument actually had weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, what possible motive would Vivian-a woman facing only six months to live-have for going after a stranger?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, his loyalty remained with Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally spoke. &#34;Whatever happened between you two, Serena, I just want you to remember one thing.She only has six months left. She joined this program to encourage people who are fighting the same battle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie took in Brandon&#39;s furrowed brow, his intense eyes, and the certainty in his voice. Her mind wandered back to Vivian&#39;s words from earlier that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This world is about marketing. Do you think this show is just about who sings best? Wake up! It&#39;s never about how well you sing or write. It&#39;s about image.Evans Entertainment didn&#39;t invest in you because they love your talent. They&#39;re counting on your market value.Monetization. Do you get that?&#34; Millie could not tell if Vivian was really that good and had managed to fool Brandon, or if he simply wanted to put his trust in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt lost, and she had no desire to start guessing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked away, her eyes searching for anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not everything turns out as perfect as it looks.Sometimes, what you think is wonderful ends up being far from it.&#34; Those words were the last advice she chose to give.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s gaze grew sharper and colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed to read him as easily as a book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment she invited him into the woods,through every question and reply, up to her latest words-she acted as though every bit of his doubt and hesitation was right there in plain view, every thought exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She appeared able to shape the way he thought,even nudging his decisions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one but a person who understood him down to the core would be capable of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He studied her and said, &#34;Tell me, who are you,really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, her mask felt painfully annoying, like it did not belong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stretched out his hand, intent on removing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, Millie moved away, but her high heels dug into the soft ground, making her lose her balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon reached out without hesitation and caught her by the arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lightning tore open the sky, and thunder quickly followed,rolling through the trees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash illuminated the groves, and as Millie fought to regain her balance, her long coat slid down her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept his grip on her slim arm, the sudden light showing fresh bruises on her delicate skin, far worse than what he had noticed on stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thunder came late and loud, the sound crashing through the woods and pounding in Brandon&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere in his memories, there lingered an image of someone bearing those same painful marks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been Millie, seven years earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those eyes filled with pain from years ago still appeared clear in his mind, as if time had never moved at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Brandon remarked, but she had already slipped her arm from his grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled her coat up over her shoulders and regained her balance. &#34;Thank you, Mr. Watson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That formal address jolted him back to the present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had never called him anything except &#34;Brandon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, the woman standing before him appeared far more frail than Millie ever had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew she belonged to Charles. Just ten days earlier, she had lost his child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled how he and Millie had been at the courthouse six days ago. The night before, they had even spent the night together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant it could not be Millie in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Charles was already making his way over,clearly sensing that something was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon could not hold back any longer. &#34;Charles let you join a reality show even when you&#39;re this hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words left his mouth before he could stop them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That doesn&#39;t concern you, Mr. Watson,&#34; Millie replied, her tone cold and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s frown deepened, and he wanted to continue,but Charles stepped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, dizziness overwhelmed Millie, and she leaned against Charles for support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mil-My God! Serena!&#34; Charles called out, worry filling his voice as he caught her, then threw a glare in Brandon&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles seemed ready to confront him, but Millie stopped him with a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon pressed his lips together, watching them stand side by side, unable to hide his frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remarked, &#34;If she&#39;s this badly hurt,why would you let her go on working?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles gave him an exasperated look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could not believe Brandon would even ask. After all, those injuries had been caused by Brandon in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles remembered how, during his hospital visit,Alexia had filled him in on all the details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had only received a mild concussion from the car accident. If she had stayed in bed and rested, she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>might not have lost the baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been Brandon who shoved Millie down the stairs later, all because he wanted to shield Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now the child was gone, and Millie&#39;s body was covered in bruises. In truth, she was fortunate nothing had been broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only Brandon had not insisted on stopping MMillie for a conversation, they might have returned to the car without any trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who was he to say anything now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles could barely hold back from letting loose on Brandon, ready to show him why he was known as Crobert&#39;s most hot-tempered man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after noticing how uneasy Millie looked, he just blurted out, &#34;Why don&#39;t you mind your own business?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gathered her in his arms and carried her straight back to the waitingg car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stood there with a heavy frown, watching as they disappeared. The way Millie&#39;shair draped across Charles&#39; arm sent a sharp pang of jealousy through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wind swept through the area, carrying more leaves to the ground. One floated gently into Brandon&#39;s open hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced down at the leaf resting in his palm</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s words stayed with him, curling in the corers of histhoughts. She had spoken with a calm certainty hinting that what looked promising at first glance offen carried a weight it didn&#39;t show</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she right about that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he was still thinking it over, raindrops started falling from the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drops splashed onto the leaf he held,each one falling like silent tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles and Millie rode in the car for a while,and then changed vehicles to head to the hospital</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie, feoling a bit stronger, turned to look out the window</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles continued to grumble under his breath about Brandon,but Milie could not bring herself to care anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s place in Crobert was far too powerful. No matter how much Charles wanted to help, they could never challonge him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So why keep struggling?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided to focus on what little she had and to work toward her own goals. That alone would have to be enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone started to vibrate once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glance at her screen showed a new message from Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rain poured from the sky in thick sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the show ended, people scattered quickly, each heading home in a different direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To keep the broadcast smooth, the audience had not been allowed to bring any electronic devices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For that reason, nobody could check their phones until the recording had finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the day, Heavenly Melody was trending online, so when the crowd finally checked their phones,they caught up on all the latest buzz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most people were only there to see the drama unfold,but a few began to ask questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did clips of Serena&#39;s performance online seemed so mediocre than it actually did during the live performance?</p>
