                <p>It was Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Millie saw him, her mood soured. She remembered the last time he had shown up at her doorstep without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t he already chosen Vivian? Why did he keep showing up, interfering in her life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, he had come to Myron&#39;s home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron led her out just as Brandon stepped forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t want to engage. She intended to walk past him and head straight for Myron&#39;s Bentley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two went out again,&#34; Brandon said, his eyes red as they lingered on herface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Obviously,&#34; Millie answered, not slowing her pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon noticed the slight redness around her eyes. She looked like she had been crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest tightened. He wanted to ask what had happened. He wanted to reach out. But she pushed his hand away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he upset you?&#34; Brandon asked, glancing toward Myron with suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Millie replied. She stepped closer to Myron. &#34;Brandon, we&#39;re divorced. Don&#39;t touch me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That instinctive move toward Myron, her calm words, and the ease with which she pushed Brandon aside-it all struck him at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart twisted. &#34;Don&#39;t forget,&#34;Brandon said, his voice hoarse.&#34;You&#39;re still in a contest with Vivian. The assets from the Bennett family are stiIl with the Watson Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie paused, looking up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; she said. &#34;And if you&#39;ve been paying attention, you should have noticed I&#39;ve been working hard to win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon bit his lip, the pain etched deep in his features. He glanced at Myron again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So this is your strategy?&#34; he asked. &#34;You go out with him so he&#39;lf help you? Is that what this is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch your mouth, Brandon,&#34; Myron said sharply, stepping in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie raised her hand, signaling she could handle it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had ignored Brandon for weeks. She had been patient and waited for the necessary legal procedures to be done, and then finalized their divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought she had been clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon never seemed to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that was the case, it was time to be clearer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t insult me,&#34; Millie said. &#34;I&#39;m going to win the contest on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been together for years, sharing countless days and nights. And now he stood before her,accusing her like this. Was this really the same man she had once loved?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Brandon could speak, she continued, &#34;We&#39;re already divorced. There&#39;s nothing left between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath caught. The pain on his face deepened. His eyes blurred with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you saying?&#34; he asked quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t love you anymore, Brandon,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had clung so tightly to the idea that their love was unbreakable, that it would survive anything, that one day,she would return to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her words now shattered that belief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just saying this to hurt me,&#34; he said. &#34;You don&#39;t mean it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to find an explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she trying to win the contest? Was this her revenge? Was it anger?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he looked into her eyes, he saw no cruelty. Just clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not trying to hurt you,&#34; she said. &#34;I really don&#39;t love you anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t look back,&#34; she said. &#34;When you chose Vivian, whatever we had, it ended there. The divorce was just a formality.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t deny what they once had, nor that she had once loved him deeply. But that love was long gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon,&#34; she said, meeting his eyes one final time. &#34;We can&#39;t go back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked away, her voice quiet. &#34;I think l&#39;ve said enough. Please don&#39;t bother me again. It would only make things harder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Myron and gave him a small nod, ready to leave with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon caught her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip was tight. His eyes were red. She could see the tears welling up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie,&#34; he whispered. &#34;Are you lying to me? We&#39;ve been through so much. We&#39;ve survived so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice trembled. &#34;We&#39;ve faced death together. You can&#39;t just-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie tried to pull away, but he held on. His fingers tightened. She stared at him, genuinely confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>HHe had been the one to break their vows. He had been the one to stray first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do I have to say for you to believe me?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said nothing. He just stood there, clutching her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave á small nod and closed her eyes for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon thought she might soften. He thought her heart might sway. But she turned toward Myron instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the art room earlier,&#34;she said,&#34;you asked me to take time to think. You said Í shouldn&#39;t decide anything in a moment of emotion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s eyes sharpened. He listened carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said his name.&#34;Myron.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He responded gently, &#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve thought it through,&#34; she said. &#34;And I&#39;ve decided. Let&#39;s be together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something cracked in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wrist ached under Brandon&#39;s grip. But she didn&#39;t look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked only at Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no joy in his face. Only concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He feared she was speaking out of anger towards Brandon. But Millie knew her own heart, and she&#39;d prove it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had taken her time and calmed her thoughts. And now she knew exactly what she truly wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean it,&#34; she said. &#34;My heart is racing for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Myron could say anything, she stepped closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her free hand and placed it gently around his neck. She stood on her toes and kissed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was soft. It was brief. But it was enough. She pulled away quickly, her cheeks flushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron trembled.. Then he pulled her into his arms, holding her tightly, as if he never wanted to let go. His warmth surrounded her,steady and strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet her other wrist still hurt from Brandon&#39;s grip.</p>
