                <p>The Watson Mansion stood proudly on the northern outskirts of Crobert, in a neighborhood known for its exclusivity and charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This particular stretch of land was owned entirely by the Watson family, with no other property in sight-quiet,private,untouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the heart of the estate lay a stunning lake shaped like a full moon, the centerpiece of the mansion grounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Locals often called it the Moonlit Estate, a poetic name that suited the way the water shimmered under the night sky and how the house wrapped gracefully around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Painted a soft, pale yellow, the mansion took on a dreamy glow after sunset. When the lights were on, it looked like a moon glowing gently on Earth,peaceful and perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nestled beside the lake, the mansion was a picture of quiet beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie brought her car to a slow stop at the entrance,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her eyes steady as they took in the familiar scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On any other day, she would have driven straight through the gates without a second thought. But today was different. Today, she came as a guest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security guard, recognizing her at once, quickly stepped out of the booth and came to greet her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Watson! It&#39;s so good to see you,&#34; he said,already pressing the button to open the large wrought -iron gates. &#34;Mr. and Mrs. Watson have been hoping you&#39;d visit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave a soft nod. &#34;I won&#39;t be driving in today.Please arrange for the estate buggy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Um-yes, of course!&#34; he replied, surprised for a second but quick to respond. &#34;I&#39;ll have it sent right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, a small buggy arrived, humming softly as it stopped in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matthew Douglas,the estate&#39;s butler, stepped out and greeted her warmly. &#34;Welcome back,Mrs. Watson,&#34; he said,opening the door with practiced grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave a slight nod and stepped in, saying nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the vehicle began to move, Millie officially entered the gates of Moonlit Estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Norma Watson&#39;s been asking about you a lot lately,&#34; Matthew said, glancing at Millie briefly as he drove. &#34;She says the house feels too quiet without you, and she&#39;s still not quite used to that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Mr. Derek Watson-he&#39;s been absolutely angry with Mr. Brandon Watson,&#34; Matthew continued,chatting away. &#34;He mentioned how Vivian doesn&#39;t hold a candle to you. Said he regrets not stepping in sooner. That he wants to speak up for you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie listened in silence, half-convinced that Derek and Norma had put Matthew up to saying all this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night wind picked up, cool and persistent,prompting her to pull her coat tighter around her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The buggy rolled along the edge of Moon Lake,offering a sweeping view of its calm expanse. A gentle breeze stirred the surface, sending ripples across the water that shimmered beneath the silver glow of the moon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the center of the lake, a stone bridge stretched toward the mansion, its reflection wavering in the moonlit water. Just then, a Bentley crossed it,heading straight to the estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie recognized it instantly-Brandon&#39;s car So,he was here too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind stirred her freshly cut hair, sending a few strands across her face. She reached into her coat pocket, pulled out a simple hair tie, and began gathering her hair into a neat twist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a quiet moment, her voice broke the stillness.&#34;Has anything happened at the mansion lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matthew took a moment to think before speaking.&#34;Mr. Derek Watson&#39;s health hasn&#39;t been the best lately,and Mrs. Norma Watson seems a bit down. Mr.Brandon Watson has dropped by a few times, but they almost always end up arguing. His parents are still abroad, and a few folks have dropped by to check on the old couple, but nothing major&#39;s happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So far,it sounded like things had been relatively calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then her gaze drifted ahead, to the Bentley parked near the entrance. A man stood beside it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,tonight wouldn&#39;t be peaceful after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The buggy came to a stop at its designated spot. Millie stepped down, adjusting the strap of her bag as she steadied herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as her heels touched the stone path,a tall shadow stretched across the ground beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t need to look up. She already knew who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson.&#34; Matthew greeted him politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave a small wave, silently motioning for him to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie said nothing. Neither did Brandon. They stood quietly, the silence stretching between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the soft glow of the moon, two people who once shared everything now felt like strangers standing on opposite shores.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s gaze lingered on Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hair was swept up now, no longer cascading down as he remembered. The scent around her was unfamiliar-something fresh, elegant, not the comforting fragrance he once associated with her.Even her shoes were different, sharp, graceful heels that clicked with quiet confidence, replacing the simpler pairs she used to wear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned slightly. It was already late April, yet she was still wearing a thin coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had changed. In more ways than one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, he finally broke the silence. &#34;Are you cold?&#34; He reached out, his fingers brushing her arm gently, as if unsure whether he still had the right to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before his fingers could find rest on her arm, she moved back ever so slightly. His touch brushed against the fabric of her sleeve, and then fell away,leaving behind an odd hollowness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows knitted tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her clothes felt too loose, too light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she lost weight?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He studied her more closely-her already delicate face now sharper, almost fragile. The weight loss made her look heartbreakingly frail. His jaw tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie said nothing in response to his question. Instead,she straightened her posture and spoke with soft restraint,reclaiming control of the moment. &#34;What do you want,Brandon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took him a second to remember why he had waited there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a deliberate step forward, his voice low but edged with accusation. &#34;That little girl with you... the one making headlines. They say she calls you her mother. When did you give birth to a child?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, his gaze dropped instinctively to her abdomen, searching for some trace of the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has nothing to do with you,&#34; she replied coolly,offering no explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of irritation flickered in his eyes. &#34;Millie,&#34; he said, his voice steely, &#34;we are still married-on paper at least. And now I find out you&#39;ve been raising a child I&#39;ve never heard about? You expect me to stay silent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie turned her face away,refusing to meet his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did she come from?&#34; he asked again, his voice more forceful now. &#34;We&#39;ve... shared so much.Countless nights, countless chances. But there was never a child. And suddenly-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop.&#34; Her voice cut through his like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon opened his mouth to speak again, but froze when he saw the glint of moisture in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie inhaled shakily and then said,&#34;You know better than anyone why I never became a mother all these years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s jaw clenched, a wave of old memories crashing behind his quiet eyes. He hadn&#39;t forgotten. No matter how many years had passed, that one tragedy still lived inside him like a wound that never quite closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had once been a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been younger then-reckless, hungry for each other, swept up in a whirlwind of passion that left little room for caution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His desire for her had been insatiable, and though they&#39;d shared countless nights together, he&#39;d failed to notice the subtle changes in her body.She had always been fragile, her health a delicate balance; her monthly cycles were often irregular, so neither of them had suspected anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the trip to Flesta. Brandon had been away on business, immersed in negotiations that turned more dangerous than he&#39;d anticipated. The opposing party had orchestrated a twisted challenge, one that demanded risk and recklessness. And without flinching,she had leapt into the frigid water, proving her courage, unaware of the life growing inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he pulled her out, her body was trembling,soaked to the bone, her lips blue, and blood seeping into the freezing current. The doctors had saved her just in time. But the child... their child... was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still saw her face as she lay in his arms,pale and broken. Her gaze had locked onto the man who had set the trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You gave me your word,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man had only nodded in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon never forgot that night. It was late autumn,and the first frost had already settled over the earth.The air was sharp, the trees bare, and his world fell apart with hers that night. She had cried in his arms,her sorrow spilling like rain, blaming herself with every breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward,her body never fully healed. No matter how many nights they spent wrapped in each other-how deep their affection or intense their desire-conceiving again became a silent, unspoken battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the years, Brandon had hoped. He had tried.Sometimes out of love, sometimes to ease his own guilt, and sometimes out of a quiet desperation to make things right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what Brandon would never know... was that after they married, she had conceived again. And then she lost that child,too.</p>
