                <p>Every message, from the first to the last, made Brandon&#39;s fingers tighten around the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rainy nights aren&#39;t lonely for me because he&#39;s here with me. What about you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He said he has feelings for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The final message lit the screen. &#34;He came to see me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each word cut deep, twisting like a blade in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything Millie had claimed was true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had been the one sending those messages,stoking the fire again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurting Millie had always been her game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he-he had been complicit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the very cause of Millie&#39;s illness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp crack split the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone screen shattered in Brandon&#39;s grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one swift move, he caught Vivian by the collar and slammed her against the headboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes burned red, his face a mask of fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; His chest rose and fell in harsh bursts, the words barely making it past his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been faking it all this time!&#34; Brandon&#39;s voice thundered through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian flinched at the force of his yell but refused to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you send those messages to her? Say it!&#34;His words dripped with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s shoulders trembled, but her lips curled into a mocking smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That smile only pushed him closer to the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian!&#34; Brandon shouted, his voice breaking with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Vivian didn&#39;t stop smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Her laughter spilled out even as tears filled her eyes. &#34;Brandon, you&#39;ve always known. I want you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m jealous of her. I can&#39;t stand the thought of you two being happy together. I don&#39;t want you hanging on to her. I want you to divorce her. That&#39;s why I sent those messages,&#34; Vivian said, her tone disturbingly casual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s chest tightened as heat surged through his veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she speak about it like it was nothing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t she always sworn she never wanted to hurt Millie? And yet, this was exactly what she was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage clawed at him, and the urge to end this with his bare hands nearly consumed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget, Brandon. You made me a promise,&#34;Vivian said, a slow smile curving her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you really dare tell Millie what happened a year ago? Would she really survive knowing the truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian kept smiling, and then shifted her gaze toward Eugene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can leave. You shouldn&#39;t be here for the rest,&#34;Vivian remarked, her voice sharp and dismissive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene didn&#39;t move. His eyes flicked to Brandon,ignoring her completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was Brandon&#39;s assistant, and he only took orders from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s bloodshot gaze stayed locked on Vivian.Hatred filled every corner of his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed her collar, clenching his jaw so hard it sent pain shooting up to his temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson?&#34; Eugene asked quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go,&#34; Brandon instructed, his voice cold enough to freeze the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; Eugene gave a small nod, turned, and shut the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ward had grown quiet, leaving only Vivian and Brandon inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone lay on the floor, its screen shattered into a spiderweb of cracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the table, a half-peeled apple sat forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The IV bag beside the bed swayed gently on its hook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian gripped Brandon&#39;s wrist, trying to force him to release her collar, but his hold didn&#39;t loosen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian let out a laugh through falling tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, don&#39;t you remember? I suffered because of her! Millie was supposed to be there, not me.Could you really stand to watch the woman you love go through what I went through? I&#39;m only asking for six months. No-there are four months left now. In</p>
                
                
                
                <p>four months, I&#39;ll be gone. Everything will disappear,and I&#39;ll take that secret with me to the grave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was steady, but every word carried weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence that followed pressed heavily against the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s hand shook as it clutched her collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A year ago...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of that day clawed its way back, nearly splintering his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he&#39;d rushed over after hearing the news... And when he&#39;d seen Vivian instead of Millie, relief had slammed into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank God it wasn&#39;t Millie. Thank God she was safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s sobs drew him back to the present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, I know l&#39;ve made choices that hurt you,&#34;she said, tears sliding down onto the back of his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I sent her those messages because my mind was twisted back then. I wasn&#39;t thinking clearly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her crying deepened, each sound heavy with despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, if you were in my place, you&#39;d understand.After everything I endured, all I could do was watch the man I loved stay by another woman&#39;s_side...I know sending those messages was wrong, but l couldn&#39;t stop myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s fingers tightened around his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, tell me-what am I supposed to do? If it were you,wouldn&#39;t you lose your mind too? I took her suffering, and I couldn&#39;t hold myself together. Then came the cancer... how could I not go mad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s sobs were raw, bitter. Brandon&#39;s gaze stayed fixed on her, the storm of anger and fear inside him pressing toward the breaking point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His feelings toward Vivian were no longer clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, there had simply been relief that Millie was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>fine. Later, he cared for her out of pity... and obligation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night after night, he&#39;d been wrenched awake by nightmares, only to find calm when Millie lay safe beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He told himself it was over, that Millie had escaped unharmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been Vivian who went that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since then, Vivian had unraveled-blood on her lips,her health crumbling into cancer. He had known every detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fear had been relentless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time he looked at her suffering,the thought crept in-what if it had been Millie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later still, Vivian hovered at death&#39;s edge. She came back from treatment in Flaville clutching her medical records. Her words were steady then. She had six months left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, I just want six months. Divorce her and stay with me.Pretend to love me so I can leave with no regrets. Think of it as payment for me taking that secret to my grave. Treat me well, and I&#39;ll never speak of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp tang of disinfectant hung in the air.Brandon stared at the woman sobbing before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t completely clueless that sometimes her choices were wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet he&#39;d always clung to the belief that beneath it all,Vivian was fragile-she wasn&#39;t a bad person, and she was just hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He owed her for that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of that debt, he kept his promise to Vivian-six months, and she would take the secret with her to the grave. Then life would go back to how it used to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, he finally saw the cost. In these months of chaos,he had wounded Millie again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had hurt the only woman he truly loved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Vivian... she was far from the harmless image she wore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, I was wrong...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down Vivian&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. I never should have treated her that way.It only happened twice. Once today-because I panicked. The other... that was when my head wasn&#39;t right.I...I lost control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s fingers wrapped around his, her gaze soft and trembling. &#34;There are only four months left.That&#39;s all. When I&#39;m gone, you can still have her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze stayed fixed on the woman crying before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But could there still be a future with Millie?</p>
