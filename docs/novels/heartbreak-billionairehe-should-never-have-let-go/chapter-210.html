                <p>Millie looked at Myron, her gaze steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was a long time ago,&#34; she whispered, her eyes faintly shining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron nodded, a small smile on his lips. &#34;Yes. A very long time ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From then until now, his feelings for her had never faded-not for a single day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after she married someone else, he had watched from a distance. On her wedding day, he had seen her in a white dress, standing beside another man, smiling beneath a sky filled with fireworks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had felt jealousy rise in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why he wanted to create an even more magnificent fireworks display of his own on the day of her divorce. He wanted to outshine anything Brandon had ever done. He needed her to remember him and him alone. He wanted a place in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come with me,&#34; he said, noticing the tears in her eyes. He led her to a series of paintings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This one shows you buying spices at the port,&#34; he said, pointing to a painting and the photo beside it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And this.., this is from Eldoria. You and Brandon were trapped then. That was the first time I stepped in to help you escape.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stopped, her eyes drawn to the image of a small boat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered that year clearly-the rushed escape, the fear of the boat sinking, the uncertainty about who or what might lie ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that cramped cabin, she and Brandon had clung to each other, the world outside reduced to waves and silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only now did she learn that Myron had been part of that escape. &#34;I took care of the problems you left behind in Eldoria,&#34; he said. &#34;I arranged for my men to escort your boat.I wanted to make sure you got out safely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had stood on the deck of his own boat back then, watching theirs disappear with her aboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I discovered Blue Rain while I was there,&#34; he added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie recalled their first date. The sky above them had shimmered with soft blue rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered him saying he had watched it alone that night from the deck back in Eldoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron gently took her hand as they walked from one painting to the next. Each was paired with a photograph or a keepsake from the past.①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke in a low voice, recounting stories from across the years-from faraway countries and from the time after his return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One painting stood out. It showed her in a wedding dress, the moment she married Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked on until they reached the final painting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stopped in front of it, standing quietly, side by side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Millie realize just how many moments Myron had witnessed in silence. He had seen her life unfold with Brandon. He had watched their love grow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had spoken only of when and where the paintings had come together. But the depth of his feelings came through without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt a heaviness in her chest. She had never imagined he had loved her like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tear slipped from her eye and landed on the hand that still held hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt it.Without letting go, he reached up and gently wiped her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t cry,&#34; he whispered. &#34;I didn&#39;t bring you here to make you cry. I don&#39;t want you to feel sad. I hate seeing you cry.&#34; Millie tried to speak, but her voice faltéred. Her emotions tangled togethor, and wordt tefused to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room stayed silont. Only the sound of then breaths filled the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Myron gently wlped another tear from her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, hesltating for a moment, he putled her into à quiet embrace,resting her forehead against hls chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t resist. The tension in his shoulders eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He patted her back, his voice low and steady.my fault. I shouldn&#39;t have brought you here. But I only wanted to show you that my feelings aren&#39;t just words.I meant it. Every word. You can frust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked up at hlm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were rimmed with red, softening his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, she had seen him as distant. A powerful man who returned from the sea and led the Elliott Group with his siblings. He had always seemed composed, mysterious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors said he had nearly died at sea. Somne said betrayal had broken him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought he had someone he loved all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she never imagined that person was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know how to carry that kind of love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since losing her father, she had given up hope of unconditional care. Everything felt like a struggle.Everything had to be earned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What happened between Brandon and Vivian had shattered her even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day she lost her child when she fell nearly ended her. If Alexia hadn&#39;t arranged the blood donation, she might not have survived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since then, she kept her hopes quiet. She didn&#39;t let herself want more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Myron had now shown her so much love. &#34;Myron,&#34;she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her eyes, nearly voicing what was on her heart. &#34;l..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to answer yet,&#34; he said gently.&#34;Take your time. I want you to think it over. No decislons made in a moment. Only what you won&#39;t regret when your feelings settle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him in the warm light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He always understood her. He always gave her space and respected her boundaries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart pounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; she said with a small, tearful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled back, still a little red around the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were thinking of spending time with the cat, weren&#39;t you?&#34; he asked. &#34;Shall we go find it? I thinkit really likes you. It usually doesn&#39;t cling to me like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded.&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34; They left the room together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced back as he turned off the lights and closed the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chubby ragdoll cat appeared, circling her feet, tail raised high, rubbing against her legs</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kiki,there you arshe said, crouching down to stroke its fluffy head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron joined her, pulling out a few treats and handing them to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie fed the cat, smiling as she remembered how Jayceon had almost named it Fatty. The thought made her laugh a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Millie changed back into her earlier casual clothes, and Myron prepared to take her home. But as soon as they reached the entrance of Elliott Mansion, their path was blocked.</p>
