                <p>Brandon&#39;s heart ached so fiercely it felt ready to burst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at Vivian, he didn&#39;t even know who deserved the blame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, it all came back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blamed himself for thinking he could control everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cursed his ownstupidity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon let go of Vivian&#39;s collar and pulled his hand away from hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he turned and stumbled toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon!&#34; Vivian&#39;s voice rang out before he could</p>
                
                
                
                <p>reach it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll still stay with me, won&#39;t you? Four months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You promised. Even if it&#39;s just pretend... Even if you only act like you love me... Stay with me, and I won&#39;t tell Millie about that incident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. It was a laugh soaked in sorrow and bitterness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, he didn&#39;t know what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, I swear I&#39;ll behave. I lost control only those two times-no more. I haven&#39;t hurt her since. Please,give me one last chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon said nothing. He only laughed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt like he was losing his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he truly went mad, maybe he could break the promise he made to Vivian. Maybe then he could run to Millie and beg her to come back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, cruelly, he was still painfully clear-headed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew exactly what he had to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene knocked on the door before stepping in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the air felt strange-thick with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is... is everything alright?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d heard faint arguing outside but couldn&#39;t catch the exact words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson?&#34; Eugene tried again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon finally stopped laughing. Drawing all his emotions inward, he looked at Eugene calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene felt a prickle of unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s ill. Make sure she gets proper treatment,&#34;Brandon said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene understood. Vivian would finally face the real treatment for the illness she had been faking all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon left without another glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian let out a quiet breath of relief. In her mind,she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>had passed this hurdle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon could never stomach Millie finding out what happened. For that reason alone, Vivian believed he wouldn&#39;t do anything do her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without the six-month agreement, he would never have accepted her terms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with only four months left, he might still cling to hope that things could return to normal afterwards.That was why he would stick to the deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian, however, knew she had to move fast. Four months was all she had to become Mrs.Watson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sniffled at the thought, bent down, and picked up her phone from the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene stood nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Simpson, you&#39;re ill and need professional help,&#34;he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian blinked at him in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll arrange the right treatment for your condition.I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hope you&#39;ll cooperate,&#34; Eugene continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left before she could reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian stood still,feeling unsettled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she pulled another phone from under the mattress; slipped out to the balcony, and dialed a number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line clicked, and a voice answered. &#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian whispered, &#34;Did you hide well? Was everything from before cleaned up? Brandon won&#39;t find out, wil he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause. &#34;Vivian, I&#39;ve risked everything for you. I set the trap for Brandon, and now I have to run for my life.Yet you still doubt me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not like that. It&#39;s just... Brandon&#39;s been acting strange. He&#39;s discovered things. He knows I faked depression. Do you think he&#39;ll check my other records from Flaville?&#34; she asked quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced around to make sure no one was watching and lowered her voice further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He can&#39;t find out about this. Have your friends in Flaville cover it up. After four months, whether it&#39;s a miracle or a misdiagnosis, there has to be a reason why I&#39;m still alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence lingered on the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian softened her tone. &#34;You&#39;re the love of my life.Without you, I wouldn&#39;t be where I am today.Everything I&#39;m doing now is for our future. And you know... I&#39;ve never let him touch me. Doesn&#39;t that prove it? I love you and only you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, the voice replied, &#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hung up, checked the balcony again to make sure no one heard her, and only then allowed herself to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie was still asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her dreams dragged her through memories she wished she could forget-her father&#39;s death,her stepfather&#39;s abuse, Brandon saving her life twice, his betrayal, and the sharp agony of falling down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She jolted awake, momentarily unsure of where she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie?&#34; a voice called. She turned to see Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; He hurried to her side, wiped the sweat from her forehead, and helped her sit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you have a nightmare?&#34; he asked gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s chest tightened. The loss of her child still cut deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled as the memories crashed over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myron,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m right here,&#34; he said, voice warm with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, she buried her face in his chest and broke into sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For so long, she had worn her strength like armor,pretending nothing could shake her. But she had her own wounds, and she had simply chosen not to share them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This nightmare had torn down her walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron didn&#39;t know exactly what had happened-only that she was hurting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held her close, murmuring quiet reassurances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In time, she calmed down, lifting her head with a hint of embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron chuckled softly and brushed away her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve cried all over your shirt,&#34; she said, noticing the damp patch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; he replied, cupping her face and wiping the last traces of tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s good to let it out. Millie, I know you&#39;ve been through so much. But now you have me. Don&#39;t carry it all alone from now on. Whatever happens,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>remember-I&#39;m here with you. You can trust me completely and lean on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was steady and sincere, his touch warm and reassuring.</p>
