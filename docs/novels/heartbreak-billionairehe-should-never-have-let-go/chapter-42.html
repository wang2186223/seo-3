                <p>At the same time, photos and clips of Brandon and Vivian arriving at the charity event had already made their way online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a matter of minutes, the hashtag #Brandon&amp;Vivian shot straight to the top of the trending topics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way,even Mr. Watson showed up, and he did it in a Bugatti Centodieci!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I called it-his date is definitely Vivian!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, the last time he appeared at the Heavenly Melody live show, it was for V/ivian. Now, he&#39;s here with her at this charity gala, and he hasn&#39;t shown up at any of these events for two years! Everyone knows what&#39;s up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s only one reason-Vivian!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s just trying to get to Millie, isn&#39;t he? I&#39;m dying over here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m rooting for them! And did you see how amazing Vivian looks tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It did not take long for another hashtag to rise-#Vivian&#39;sBlackWeddingGown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait a second, Vivian only hassix months left. That&#39;s a wedding dress, but it&#39;s black. I can&#39;t help but feel emotional.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She obviously wants to marry Brandon, but this annoying certain someone keeps standing in her way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish Millie would just walk away. Didn&#39;t you notice?Vivian fainted last night from exhaustion, yet she&#39;s still working to help sick children and raise awareness.How can Millie even compete with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Praise for Vivian exploded online, with emotional reactions pouring in from every direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the charity gala hall, Charles scrolled through the endless stream of comments, his anger barely contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is disgusting,&#34; he remarked,facing Millie. &#34;Evans Group never sent an invitation to Vivian! For a charity gala of this level, why would we include someone with her reputation? Just look at what she&#39;s doing-showing up in what&#39;s basically a wedding dress? It&#39;s infuriating! This was supposed to be about raising funds and helping sick kids, but now all anyone can talk about is her and Brandon!&#34; Charles&#39; frustration</p>
                
                
                
                <p>grew with every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At gatherings like these, it was normal to see guests showing off their looks or relationships, just as long as they made real donations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Vivian&#39;s behavior was almost too much to stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online, everyone was fixated on her supposed &#34;wedding dress&#34;, and there were endless gossips about Brandon going out of his way for her every chance he got.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was clearly doing all this just to get under Millie&#39;s skin!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never seen anyone try to ruin someone else&#39;s relationship and be so proud of it!&#34; Charles hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie felt grateful for Charles&#39; support. Yet,there was little either of them could do to change anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was protected by her story-that she only had six months left. And people were willing to overlook almost anything because of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Brandon was also on his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the trending hashtags, he realized the publicity campaign was working at full force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He switched over to check his messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still nothing from Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s brow furrowed. Was it just a bad signal?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since the last time he left the Watson Group with Vivian, Millie had started spending more time with Alexia and Giffard, stirring up plenty of drama herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that he was at the gala with Vivian, he wondered what Millie would do in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen remained frozen on the final thing he had typed to her, the words still lingering like they were waiting for an answer. &#34;My grandfather&#39;s condition has deteriorated significantly. He&#39;s requesting to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scrolled up to see if he missed anything, but there was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s fingers hovered for a second before he closed the chat window. No sooner had he done so than the screen blinked and filled with a stream of incoming messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The connection had no issues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There just hadn&#39;t been a single word from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint tension pulled at his mouth. &#34;Brandon?&#34; asked Vivian, watching his expression shift.&#34;Did something happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon let his eyes fall shut, slipped his phone into his pocket, and when he looked up again, his expression was composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a slight shake of his head. At the same time,his hand tightened into a fist beneath the table where no one could see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes dragged on, with each new auction item brought forward, introduced, and carried off by eager buyers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each donor at the event could choose what percentage of their earnings from each item they wished to contribute. At the Evans Group&#39;s auctions,items with matching donation percentages were always grouped within the same session. For this reason, unless otherwise indicated, every item on offer during this session carried a 70% donation rate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the very first item, which was an antique meant to get the audience warmed up, featured a lower donation rate of 50%. All others that followed held steady at 70%.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because this auction was organized by the Evans Group, every item up for bid represented something truly valuable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian observed as more and more items appeared,yet she kept quiet and refrained from making any bids,knowing how high the prices were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt determined to show Brandon that she could handle things herself and pay with her own money,but she had no interest in making any extravagant purchases.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, right before the scheduled break, a new item made its entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The next piece we have for auction is a tanzanite stone. According to our assessment, the value of this tanzanite is at least one million dollars, its...&#34; The auctioneer continued while the richly colored tanzanite was displayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lighting inside the Evans Group&#39;s auction hall was flawless, so when the vivid blue tanzanite went up on the stage, it drew everyone&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quality of this tanzanite was outstanding, making it one of the most striking gems in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one classic film, the female lead wore a necklace described as a blue diamond. However, the gemstone used for the movie&#39;s prop was actually tanzanite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even theugh this tanzanite was still in its natural state,just leoking at it brought to mind that famous necklace</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the crowd focused on the gemstone, Millie turned her attention to it as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This particular gem had come from her collection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had originally sold it to Charles, and he made sure to erase any identifying details before sending it to auction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she made the decision to attend, Millie realized she needed to contribute something special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This event, after all, was a charity gala.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arriving without any kind of donation would have made it impossible to gain Napier&#39;s approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her intention tonight was to impress Napier and leave him satisfied with her actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the tanzanite did not reach the staggering prices of other pieces, it still held just enough value to reflect her reputation as an emerging star.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On top of that...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie let her gaze drop toward the floor. She had originally picked out this tanzanite as a gift for the child she never got to meet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she purchased the gem, her heart was filled with anticipation, and she looked forward to welcoming her baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things had changed since then...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After she found out the donations would benefit children suffering from illness, she felt moved to part with the tanzanite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting this stone go became her personal way of doing something kind in honor of the baby she lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet wish formed in her heart,hoping her child was safe and at peace wherever they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the spotlight, the deep blue tanzanite sparkled with an almost magical light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The bidding for this tanzanite starts at seven hundred thousand dollars, and the minimum increase...&#34; The auctioneer&#39;s announcement trailed off as someone in the audience raised their paddle, prompting the number board to flash a new figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An offer has been made for eight hundred thousand dollars.&#34; When the auctioneer repeated the amount,all eyes turned to the bidder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire room realized at once that it was Vivian who now held up her paddle.</p>
