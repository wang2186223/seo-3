                <p>Millie immediately understood what was happening. Vivian was fighting back. They were trying to distract the public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a wave of online marketing flooded in. The narrative shifted. &#34;Brandon just brought Vivian along.They never officially said they were together, Didn&#39;t Millie show up with Charles? So what does that make Millie and Charles?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At the auction, Vivian made the first bid on the tanzanite. She used Brandon&#39;s card because she didn&#39;t have her own. it was clearly her choice. Later, Millie kept bidding to drive the price up just to get to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More importantly, Vivian didn&#39;t know Serena was Millie. She just wanted to donate a few million to charity.Millie, on the other hand, knew everything and still kept raising the stakes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,VVivian didn&#39;t have her own number card. You can&#39;t blame her for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online, both sides continued arguing. The comments were relentless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People stuck to their opinions, but some started to waver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The focus gradually shifted from Vivian&#39;s dress issue and replaced by speculation about everyone&#39;s intentions when the bidding war started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the lounge, Charles frowned with disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing he was still on camera, he turned away and typed behind his phone.&#34;I&#39;ve never seen someone so shameless. If she were Qakley, I&#39;d have beaten her already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie glanced over and chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She began typing. &#34;She&#39;s walking straight into ler own downfall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles looked at her, suddenly remembering something. There was a hint of eagerness in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember what we talked about when this first started?&#34; Millie asked with a calm voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Serena&#39;s donation fraud scandal broke out, they had chosen not to respond right away, mostly because Millie and Brandon hadn&#39;t finalized their divorce yet. The original plan was to stay patient,and as soon as the divorce wwent through, they could speak out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with Watson Group and Elliott Group stepping in, they decided to hold back and wait for the finals.They wanted to release undeniable proof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the minor adjustment, the plan was already in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Step one was to reveal Serena&#39;s reaI identity. That would instantly discredit the donation fraud story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,step two-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The truth will come out,&#34; Millie murmured. She kept typing. &#34;The tanzanite is mine. I donated it for charity.That&#39;s a fact.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her phone buzzed with a message. &#34;Here&#39;s the archive of your tanzanite purchase.&#34; There was a document attached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was from Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie raised her eyebrows, paused, and replied. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron texted back right away. &#34;Just doing my job. No thanks needed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this archive, and the records she had already shared with Charles, their case was solid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie forwarded all the documents to their group chat, and then exchanged a look with Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now they only needed to choose the right time to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting things brew a little longer would maximize the effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was Seville&#39;sspecialty, so Millie had nothing to worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon seeing the documents Millie sent, Seville let out a laugh. He was already giving instructions to his team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Vivian reappeared on the live stream and took her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked like she had just finished crying. Her eyes were red. Her expression was heavy, like she was holding something back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes earlier, she had been crying in front of Brandon. She had also ordered Johnny to manage the team and launch a-counterattack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had asked Brandon several questions. He hadn&#39;t answered any of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He only wiped her tears and said, &#34;I&#39;ll talk to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounded like the same vague reply as before. But something felt different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because when she tried to use Watson Group&#39;s resources to clear her name later, Eugene refused. She didn&#39;t dare push further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen it clearly. Brandon&#39;s hesitation. His sorrow when he found out Serena was Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had wanted to say more. But then he picked up a call from Derek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian stayed quiet after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Brandon had already left the venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he sat in the back of a Bentley, staring out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene drove in silence,heading toward Moonlit Estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon watched the scenery flash by. His chest felt tight. His thoughts were scattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes earlier, he had finally taken his grafdfather&#39;s call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come back here right now!&#34; Derek had shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek already knew what had happened between Brandon and Millie. But he no longer expected Brandon to fix it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew Brandon had attended the show with Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Derek had given a direct order. He told Brandon to return home at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scenery rushed past the window. Brandon&#39;s thoughts were in chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the front seat, Eugene glanced at his boss through the rearview mirror. The air inside the car felt stifling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Serena is really Mrs. Watson,&#34; Eugene thought. &#34;How&#39;s this going to end now?&#34; But he kept this to himself.He didn&#39;t dare say a word out loud. He just kept driving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,they reached Moonlit Estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Brandon stepped inside, he heard Derek&#39;s voice. &#34;On your knees.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon said nothing. He lowered his head and knelt in front of Derek&#39;s wheelchair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek&#39;s face was full of rage. He hit Brandon with his cane. &#34;You&#39;ve really messed things up! I had no interest in watching that show, but I tuned in for Millie. And look at what I saw. How do you expect to face her? I&#39;ve told you over and over to stay away from that Vivian woman. You never listened.You said you had your reasons. Tell me, do those reasons make Millie forgive you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every sentence, the cane struck harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t flinch. His eyes were full of pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no idea what to say,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t answer Vivian&#39;s questions. He didn&#39;t know how Millie felt. He had no way to explain himself to his grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak!&#34; Derek demanded.</p>
