                <p>Online discussion was intensifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Elliott Group released a video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It captured the scene from the tanzanite auction at the jewelry house. This was when Millie purchased the tanzanite from Elliott Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the video, everyone&#39;s face was blurred except hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had been seated alone in a corner, silently raising her paddle again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, a man taunted her. &#34;If you were anyone else, I&#39;d let it go. It&#39;s just a stone. But since you&#39;re Brandon&#39;s wife, there&#39;s no way I&#39;m giving it to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked at him calmly. &#34;What would it take for you to let me have it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man let out a loud laugh, eyes locked on her. &#34;Right here, in front of everyone-say you&#39;re a bitch,call Brandon worthless, and agree to collaborate with me. Only then will I back down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stood without hesitation, still smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone thought she might comply. Instead, she picked up a paddle and struck him across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck you!&#34; The man reeled back, furious, about to charge at her. Millie didn&#39;t even flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll sue you! That&#39;s assault!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him a faint smile. &#34;Go ahead. The paddle&#39;s so light, the mark will fade before you reach the door.Think you can prove anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Millie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you&#39;re right. I am humiliating you,&#34; she said, her tone even. &#34;I won&#39;t let you insult Brandon. Not under any circumstances.&#34; Her voice was calm, but her eyes were cold. &#34;Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man shouted, &#34;Aren&#39;t you afraid you&#39;ll lose the stone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t answer right away. She just smiled, her composure sharpening the contrast with his rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try me,&#34; she said. &#34;Do you really think you can scare me or go up against the Watsons?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence spread across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man froze, caught between advancing and retreating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Millie spoke again. &#34;Looks like I the paddle cut you a bit. Maybe go clean up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He latched onto the out she offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Muttering threats under his breath, he turned toward the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as he reached the door, he paused and looked back. &#34;You fight so hard for Brandon. You do everything for him. But what if one day he leaves you? That will leave you the laughingstock of all of Crobert!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milie didn&#39;t look at him. She turned to the rest of the room. &#34;Anyone else want to bid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man let out a final snort. &#34;You&#39;ll regret this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie said nothing back. She just won the tanzanite without issue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of his repeated bids, the price had risen higher than expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The video then showed her receiving the gem later with a gentle smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone nearby asked, &#34;You look so happy, Mrs. Watson. Is there something special about this tanzanite?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gazed down at the deep blue stone, smiling softly. &#34;If we have a child, this would make a beautiful piece of jewelry for them. I think Brandon would love it too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This video went viral online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie was rarely seen on public after she marfied Brandon. Most of the time, she came across as distant more like a background figure next to Brandon than someone real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was rare to see her so alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This video changed that. It revealed her strength, her decisiveness, and her deep loyalty to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She looked so gentle and happy, talking about the tanzanite, her future child, and her husband. So why did she end up selling it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Isn&#39;t it obvious? Are you really that naive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>--·</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The debate online continued to rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Moonlit Estate, Brandon could no longer stay on his feet. He sank to the floor and watched the video in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered the moment she had smiled at him and gently placed his hand on her bely. &#34;I&#39;ll take good care of my health,&#34; she had said. &#34;We can have another child in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The child they had lost in Flesta was a wound that never closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They never spoke of those days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That pain lingered, too deep to revisit. He had buried himself in her embrace, chasing the hope of creating something new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It became his obsession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet he had even competed with her for the very birthstone she had chosen for their future child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They hadn&#39;t had a child yet. But the tanzanite had meant something more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had she been thinking as she bid against him? Did it hurt her to see Vivian sitting beside him as he raised his paddle over and over?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon lowered his head. A single tear slid dovn his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What else had he missed? What more had he really done to hurt her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-.·</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, public opinion online was overwhelmingly in Millie&#39;s favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, the final live broadcast of Heavenly Melody came to a close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host announced the winners on stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena-Millie-was declared the champion without contest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she accepted the trophy, dazzling lights lit up the stage around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood in a wash of gold and silver, confetti raining down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The applause was deafening, Online, the comment section overflowed with congratulations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crowds chanted her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once offstage, Millie finally allowed herself to relax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The competition is finally over,&#34; she said with a smle to Barbara beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara grinned. &#34;The sponsor reps are all here. Time to sign some contracts!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each sponsor had promised resources for the champion. Now that the competition had ended, they would begin to fulfill their commitments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara grew more excited by the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all headed backstage. The representatives were already seated, including those from Elliott Group.Jayceon and Adriana had left for dinner, so only Myron remained at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Millie and the others entered, Myron stood and offered his hand. &#34;Congratulations on winning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie smiled and shook his hand. &#34;Thank you, lfook forward to working together with the Elliott Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>°As do I,&#34; Myron said with a polite smile. &#34;Let&#39;s make this a great partnershíp.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were no objections. The lawyers had reviewed the contracts beforehand, so everything was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie signed her name. Each party received a copy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reps all nodded in approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daphne, though visibly displeased, said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already decided to stay quiet after learning Serena was actually Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she was the runner-up and would receive some support. That was her only consolation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The third-place contestant had never expected to rank so high. They accepted their modest share of resourcés with good cheer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Vivian looked truly shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the venue, a large crowd had gathered. They had originally come to protest Serena staying in the show. Now, the atmosphere had shifted entirely. Vivian hesitated to step outside. She wasn&#39;t sure what might be waiting for her there.</p>
