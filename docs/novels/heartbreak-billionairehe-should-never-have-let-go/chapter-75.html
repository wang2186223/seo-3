                <p>Vivian lowered her head again, her voice trembling as she forced out a cry. &#34;Brandon, I&#39;m okay now. I really don&#39;t want to see a doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon frowned. &#34;Your health isn&#39;t great. Seeing a doctor might help ease things a little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor beside them gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d heard about Vivian&#39;s illness-who hadn&#39;t? The media had been all over it, and he couldn&#39;t help but feel sorry for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian managed a weak smile. &#34;It&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll just take some painkillers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she added in a low voice, laced with dry humor,&#34;What&#39;s one more day or one less? It doesn&#39;t change much anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked over at Brandon again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t meet her gaze. Instead, he waved the doctor off and helped her up from the couch, walking her toward the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This has nothing to do with you. he said flatly I&#39;m just exhausted from handling my grandparents today Im really not in the mood You need to rast So get some proper sleep</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He called the caregiver who had stepped out when the doctor arrived back in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take care of her. Brandon instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver didn&#39;t reply right away and instead looked to Vivian. uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian held on to Brandon with her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out and patted her gently on the head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t let my grandparents know i&#39;m here. I&#39;ll come by when i can,&#34; Brandon said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian knew better than to keep pretending now. She couldn&#39;t risk him calling the doctor back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she turned her face to the side and kept up the image of being hurt</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave one last reminder to the caregiver and turned to leave</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as he reached the door. Vivian&#39;s voice drifted after him, soft and bitter &#34;I don&#39;t know what she said to you tonight... but Brandon. I just want to know  you really feel. Is the issue with the child really sottled?Who&#39;s that child? She&#39;s using your grandparents-and the child-to reel you back in. Are you really going to let her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon paused for a heartbeat. But he didn&#39;t turn around. He kept walking. The door closed quietly behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian clenched her jaw as she looked at the caregiver, who was quietly tidying up nearby. She flung whatever she could grab in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How humiliating!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had practically thrown herself at him-standing completely naked in front of him-yet he still wouldn&#39;t touch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was totally unacceptable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t let the Watson family keep pulling Brandon back to Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts spun quickly, and within seconds, she picked up her phone and made a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon left the apartment building, walked out into the night, and slid into the driver&#39;s seat of his Bentley.But he didn&#39;t drive off right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lit a cigarette, rolled down the window,and stared into the drifting smoke as it curled into the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That event a year ago... he still didn&#39;t feel like thinking about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The incident had changed so many things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s parting words kept repeating in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head began to ache, and he pressed his fingers into his temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon knew Vivian sometimes went too far. He wasn&#39;t blind to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she only had six months left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that... after she was gone, things would go back to how they used to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cigarette burned down to the filter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon flicked it out, picked up his phone, and called Darden. Then he started the engine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Blue Lounge, the music throbbed through the floor and spilled into the streets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside one of the dark, private rooms, Brandon sat quietly, separated from the crowd below, watching them dance to the rhythm. The door opened, and Darden walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drinking alone now?&#34; he asked, raising an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gestured to the table beside him,where a glass, a bucket of ice, and a few unopened bottles waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden took the seat next to him, and Brandon quietly poured him a drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of them sat on the cushy leather couch. They both leaned against the low-lit bar counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; Darden asked after a sip. &#34;I heard your grandpa called you back to Moonlit Estate with Millie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Brandon stared down at the ice in his glass before looking out over the dancing crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That what&#39;s got you all worked up?&#34; Darden pressed,tilting his glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t answer right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head was a mess-Millie&#39;s tears, Vivian&#39;s breakdown... All of it tangled and heavy in his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost without meaning to, Brandon asked, &#34;That woman you talked about last time-what&#39;s going on with you guys that now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden, who had been waiting for Brandon to open up,was disappointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,so we&#39;re talking about me now? Trying to feel better by laughing at my drama?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t say anything. He hadn&#39;t meant it that way. It had just slipped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Brandon distracted, Darden let it go and downed another sip before continuing, &#34;It&#39;s still a mess. She&#39;s still freezing me out. I mean, I might not run something as big as Watson Group, but I&#39;m still the heir to my family&#39;s company. She can&#39;t keep treating me like I&#39;m nothing. I&#39;ve tried everything. Flowers,designer bags, apology notes, her favorite food..nothing gets through. Booked a table at her favorite place-Michelin-starred, mind you-she didn&#39;t even show up. Whenever I call, she&#39;s busy. Whenever | text,no reply. She&#39;s making sure I feel it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he sighed, sounding more tired than angry now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rubbing his head, Darden finally said, &#34;I get it. It&#39;s about that McCoy girl. I was dumb. I shouldn&#39;t have gone shopping with her. Now Alyssa&#39;s making sure l learn my lesson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon listened,watching the dancers.Darden&#39;s situation wasn&#39;t that different from his point of view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s voice echoed in his mind again. &#34;Have you sorted out the issue with the child? Is the issue with the child really settled? Who&#39;s that child? She&#39;s using your grandparents-and the child-to reel you back in.Are you really going to let her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had told Millie nothing would change, and she would still be his wife six months later. She could&#39;ve just waited quietly for these six months to pass. She could&#39;ve even left the country for a while. Instead,she chose to behave this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she was trying to raise her value in the long run.Make sure that when they got married again, it would be under her terms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the child-whether it was his or not-was the biggest lever. His grandparents would insist on seeing the child,and Millie knew that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew the reason behind their rushed marriage.She also knew what the loss of their baby had done to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s eyes darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was clever. Calculated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had almost fallen for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning came quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie went through the clothes she had stored away here and found a simple, elegant dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After freshening up, she made her way toward Derek and Norma&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as she reached the path leading to the door,Brandon&#39;s car pulled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting another scene, she picked up her pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie!&#34; She had barely moved when Brandon pulled in,stepped out, and came to stand quietly at her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t answer and kept walking towards the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the next second, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her off the path, into the woods. He pressed her back against a tree. And then, without a word, he kissed her -hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, what are you doing...&#34; she started,but the rest of her words disappeared beneath his lips.</p>
