                <p>As soon as Napier&#39;s words filled the hall, everyone&#39;s attention shifted back to the two prominent seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon studied the woman nearby. She stood completely still, her true feelings hidden beneath her mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Business wvorld often felt like a battleground, full of strategy and subtle moves. For those at the center,mind games could make all the difference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Brandon, self-control was everything. Over time,he had mastered the art of staying unreadable, and that skill had helped him win many of these silent duels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody could tell what he was truly thinking, nor could they guess if his calm manner meant strong confidence or simply served as a bluff. At the same time, whenever he let any emotion slip, it was impossible to know whether he was accidentally exposing a weakness or deliberately setting a trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He always seemed to find a way to read his rivals,unraveling their strategies with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the woman before him was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon narrowed his eyes, determined to pick up on anything she might reveal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Napier grew quiet, the spotlight shifted to the woman behind the mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone watched as she lifted her gaze and looked straight at Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a barely-there smile on her lips, she met his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then slowly raised her right hand, and soon a new figure showed on the digital board.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fifteen million now from bidder 823!&#34; Napier&#39;s calm,seasoned voice carried through the entire venue with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was over fifteen times more than where things had started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stone itself was worth just about one million,and now the price tag had soared to fifteen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, the room had been full of noise and excitement, but now the silence was so thick, no one dared breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every person seemed frozen, all waiting to see what would happen next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fifteen million from bidder 823. Will anyone else offer more?&#34; At that, every gaze shifted back to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept his face as unreadable as ever, though his right hand rose in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s calm voice rang out, saying, &#34;Bidder 888matches with eighteen million dollars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eighteen million dollars!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A collective gasp swept through the audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single tanzanite stone had now climbed to an astonishing eighteen million dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And there was still no guarantee this would be the final price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Napier wasted no time. &#34;Bidder 888 stands at eighteen million dollars. Is there anyone willing to go higher?&#34;The weight of his words seemed to hang over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, all eyes returned to the masked woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would she actually push the bidding any further?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she raised the amount yet again, could she handle the consequences of that choice?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eighteen million dollars meant little to someone like Brandon,whose fortune was practically limitless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could easily choose to match or outdo her bid,especially if it meant putting more money toward charitable causes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Brandon, this sum barely made a dent. His personal contributions to charity in the past year alone</p>
                
                
                
                <p>had already reached well over a billion. These included scholarships,projects for rural development, medical support for sick children, disaster relief, specialized schools, and many different funds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some donations had come from him alone or in his and his wife&#39;s names. Meanwhile, the Watson Group had supported an even wider range of charitable programs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With all that wealth, Brandon might feel slighted enough to drive the price even higher,just to make things difficult for the woman across from him, or to tarnish her reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would she still be brave enough to make another move?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air was thick with tension as the crowd stared at the masked woman, waiting for her next step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without the slightest hint of hesitation, she calmly lifted her right hand once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Napier&#39;s announcement rang through the hall. &#34;Bidder 823 has offered twenty million dollars!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, the mood in the room shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People looked at the masked woman with new eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to be out of her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she genuinely have no fear at all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her rival was none other than Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon had made it clear that he would not stop until the tanzanite belonged to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bidder 823 puts forward twenty million dollars. Do l hear anything higher?&#34; Napier asked, steering the spotlight toward Brandon, yet every gaze remained fixed on the woman behind the mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many thought she had completely lost her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most guests had the means to bid twenty million,considering only the most affluent and influential had been invited, but none felt they could match her boldness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill flickered in Brandon&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recognized her actions for what they were-a direct challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every confident and seemingly playful bid, she was testing him. This was not just about showing off wealth or power; it was about pushing the limits of his patience, as well as his authority as head of the Watson Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon did not hesitate. He raised his right hand again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bidder 888 is increasing the offer to twenty-five million dollars!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock rippled through the crowd. Twenty-five million dollars!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody in the room had imagined the bidding would reach such heights, except perhaps for one person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bidder 888 is offering twenty-five million dollars. Is there anyone prepared to bid higher?&#34; Napier called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The focus in the room stayed fixed on the masked woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon watched her closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze sharpened, and he tried to see past the mask,hoping to uncover the real reason for her daring bids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the woman only gave a subtle smile, then calmly lifted her right hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of raising her bid, the masked woman gently pressed her right hand over her heart and gave a slight bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You win,&#34; she remarked. &#34;Congratulations, Mr.Watson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her calm words carried through the hall, leaving the audience in stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as everyone expected her to keep fighting, she stepped back,handling her exit with unexpected grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if she had been guiding every moment, with Brandon playing along in the story she set in motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The spotlight lingered on her, highlighting the elegance of her silver satin gown and her delicate silhouette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this truly a loss for her,though?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around, the room filled with whispers and glances as guests chose sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some insisted that she had failed miserably, while those who understood better saw something entirely different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just achieved a stunning victory in the battle of wills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve now reached the final stage of bidding. Bidder 888 has offered twenty-five million dollars. Will anyone go higher?&#34; Napier&#39;s voice cut through the tension, snapping everyone back to the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty-five million dollars was way more than most could imagine paying for a single tanzanite stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Napier called out, &#34;Twenty-five million,first call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence met his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued, &#34;Twenty-five milion,second call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, not a sound from the audience. Napier announced, &#34;Twenty-five million,final call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He allowed a few seconds to pass, but no one dared to make another offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Napier brought down the gavel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spotlight caught both Brandon and the dazzling, rich blue tanzanite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Napier announced, &#34;The tanzanite has been sold for twenty-five million dollars! Please confirm your number again, 888. Congratulations on your new treasure.&#34;</p>
