                <p>Brandon found himself drawn once again to visit Hayden in his sterile prison environment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They positioned themselves on opposing sides of the thick glass barrier, eyes locked in silent combat until Hayden broke the tension by lifting the phone first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s eyes drifted downward momentarily before his own fingers wrapped around the receiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What brings you back to this place again?&#34;Hayden&#39;s voice carried through the static. &#34;Tell me,did the divorce finally happen? Or did she refuse to sign?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon maintained his characteristic composure,though something fragile flickered behind his eyes.&#34;We completed the proceedings. But the truth is...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice trailed off as shadows of sorrow clouded his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She craved freedom from the very beginning,&#34; he admitted quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayden&#39;s interest sparked like a flame catching dry wood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, so you believed you were the one seeking freedom, yet she was the one who cast you aside.&#34;Hayden condensed the painful truth into a single cutting sentence that sliced through Brandon&#39;s defenses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon offered no reply, choosing silence as his shield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayden erupted into wild laughter, his body convulsing with cruel amusement. The sound echoed harshly through the visiting room as he threw his head back in pure amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How fascinating!&#34; When his mirth finally subsided,he dabbed at the moisture in his eyes and continued,&#34;This outcome never crossed my mind. I can still picture that day when you prostrated yourself before me, begging for her sake, while I looked down on you like you were nothing more than dirt beneath my feet.Back then, I was convinced you two shared a love so powerful it could conquer death itself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayden&#39;s laughter erupted again, harsher this time.&#34;Yet here we stand, and it appears every sacrifice was completely meaningless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon maintained his stoic silence, refusing to take the bait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something sinister stirred in Hayden&#39;s memory,and malice crept into his tone. &#34;Looking back on those events, it was your cunning deception that prevented me from completing my work; otherwise, she would have been utterly destroyed by my hands!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with a sneer that transformed his face into something grotesque, he continued, &#34;Do you feel the sting of remorse for rescuing her that day? Wouldn&#39;t your life be infinitely simpler if you had simply allowed me to beat her to death? Now that-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I harbor no regret whatsoever,&#34; Brandon interrupted with quiet conviction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My presence here today serves a different purpose -to finally settle something within myself,&#34; he added with newfound resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was fully aware that today marked the scheduled date for Ari&#39;s critical surgery, but he also understood with painful clarity that Millie would never permit him to visit the child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That realization had driven him to this visiting room instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witnessing Hayden&#39;s twisted features had confirmed the conviction that had been growing steadily in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Settle what exactly?&#34; Hayden pressed with insatiable curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon refused to satisfy his morbid interest with an explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He placed the phone back in its cradle with deliberate care. Ignoring Hayden&#39;s desperate attempts to draw him back into conversation, he rose from his chair and strode away with purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He navigated his vehicle through the city streets and arrived at the hospital, where he settled into a quiet vigil in the parking area below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He accepted his unwelcome status, so he contented himself with the possibility of glimpsing them from this safe distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>... Within the hospital corridors, Millie paced with nervous energy while she waited for news,accompanied by Alexia, who had just ended her shift and came to provide emotional support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like an eternity of agonizing suspense,the operating room doors finally swung open, and Ari emerged on a wheeled gurney, surrounded by medical personnel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie rushed forward immediately, her maternal instincts overriding everything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cast a worried glance at Ari, who remained unconscious from the anesthesia, and then lifted her eyes to meet Giffard&#39;s gaze with desperate hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giffard&#39;s face broke into a reassuring smile as he nodded with professional confidence. &#34;The surgical procedure proceeded exactly as planned without any complications.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie felt the crushing weight of anxiety finally begin to lift from her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, they guided Ari&#39;s gurney toward the recovery ward, and Alexia moved closer, her voice soft with encouragement. &#34;Everything will work out perfectly, Millie. As long as we provide her with proper care post-surgery, Ari will heal and develop into a child who&#39;s completely indistinguishable from any other. And the adoption paperwork has been progressing steadily through the legal system for quite some time now. Although the standard processing time typically requires approximately thirty working days, if all the bureaucratic elements align favorably, the entire process could be finalized in less than a month!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s head bobbed with enthusiastic agreement, her eyes glistening with unshed tears of overwhelming relief and joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything had progressed exactly according to their most optimistic expectations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, Ari would emerge from this ordeal completely healed, and once the legal adoption proceedings reached completion, they would transform into the authentic family she had always envisioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As their small procession approached the entrance to the general ward, they discovered Charles and Myron positioned near the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two men had been engaged in quiet conversation, but they immediately ceased their dialogue upon witnessing the group&#39;s arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We heard about the surgery and came to check on Ari&#39;s condition,&#34; Myron explained, his voice carrying genuine concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles reinforced this statement with a firm,decisive nod of agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s guard remained completely lowered. With Ari&#39;s surgical procedure having concluded successfully and her spirits soaring with happiness,she felt generous toward everyone around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giffard acknowledged both men with professional courtesy, though his attention lingered particularly on Myron. &#34;The operation proceeded flawlessly without any complications. Under normal recovery circumstances, Ari should be medically cleared for discharge within approximately five to ten days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A collective exhale of relief swept through everyone gathered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Ari&#39;s medical condition could be successfully addressed through surgical intervention, everyone had still harbored deep-seated anxiety about potential complications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This calls for·a proper celebration,&#34; Charles declared with genuine enthusiasm brightening his expression. &#34;We should all share a meal to commemorate this victory!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie exhaled slowly, her practical nature asserting itself despite her elevated mood. &#34;Perhaps we should wait until Ari actually walks out of this hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giffard voiced his agreement with a thoughtful nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s expression became a complex tapestry of conflicting emotions as her gaze settled on Myron with careful scrutiny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something fundamental had shifted during her absence that day when she had stepped away to the restroom. The memory nagged at her-she could distinctly recall how Millie had consistently rejected Myron&#39;s advances in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes drifted toward Millie with a curious assessment. However, if Millie had genuinely developed feelings for him, that development could only be considered positive. He certainly appeared far more dependable and emotionally stable than Brandon had ever proven to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone basked in the warm glow of shared happiness, while the final golden rays of sunset</p>
                
                
                
                <p>streamed through the hospital windows, bathing the ward in warm, comforting light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Brandon maintained his solitary vigil in the parking area below until he witnessed the jubilant group descending for their dinner celebration, their faces radiating unmistakable joy. Brandon understood immediately that Ari&#39;s surgery had been triumphant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed open his car door and stepped onto the asphalt. After inquiring about Ari&#39;s room number at the information desk, he ascended to the appropriate floor and positioned himself at the doorway,his gaze penetrating the space within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes absorbed the scene of Millie and Myron seated beside the hospital bed. She moved a damp cloth across Ari&#39;s small hands with tender care while Myron cradled a water basin between his palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once Ari returns home, she&#39;ll lkely benefit from professional care assistance during her recovery period. My family has maintained relationships with exceptional caregivers for decades, or alternatively, you could request recommendations from the Hussain siblings. Their endorsement should guarantee exceptional quality service as well,&#34; Myron suggested thoughtfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t dismiss the offer, continuing her tender ministrations as she responded, &#34;That sounds reasonable. I&#39;ll arrange meetings with them and evaluate how well we might work together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their exchange flowed with natural ease, resembling the comfortable rhythms shared by couples who had grown accustomed to discussing practical matters together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon absorbed this intimate tableau in complete silence, eventually lowering his gaze and pulling back from the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chose not to intrude upon their peaceful moment,instead turning away and retracing his steps toward the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brandon&#39;s footsteps faded down the corridor,Millie experienced a brief pause in her gentle care of Ari&#39;s arm. She lifted her eyes toward the glass partition visible in her peripheral vision, and then redirected her focus back to her task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could have sworn a shadow had flickered behind the transparent barrier just moments before.But she might have been mistaken in her perception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The days began flowing into one another with predictable rhythm, and life settled into its repetitive daily patterns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During this extended period, Millie established permanent residence beside Ari&#39;s bedside,conducting all her necessary business from the confines of the hospital ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari progressed steadily toward complete recovery,her natural vitality returning with each passing day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Myron&#39;s visits increased in both frequency and duration, accompanied by regular appearances from Adriana and Jayceon, a distinctly mischievous sparkle began to dance within Ari&#39;s bright, observant eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One particular afternoon, Ari posed an unexpectedly direct question to Millie. &#34;Are you in a romantic relationship with Myron?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s eyes widened with surprise. What could such a young child possibly understand about the complexities of adult romantic relationships?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I once overheard Alexia and Charles discussing how you wanted Myron to be my father,&#34; Ari explained,her eyes shimmering with the brightness of distant stars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie considered the question with careful deliberation before responding, &#34;So tell me honestly,do you believe you could accept him in that capacity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari devoted serious thought to the weighty question,and then bobbed her head with decisive approval and declared, &#34;He seems perfectly acceptable to me.He has a gentle temperament, he looks good, and he draws. His cat has recently mastered some impressive new tricks, and Jayceon shared a delightful video with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s laughter bubbled up spontaneously as she pressed a tender kiss to Ari&#39;s forehead. &#34;You&#39;re absolutely enchanted by his cat, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari nodded with enthusiastic agreement. &#34;Kiki demonstrates such remarkable intelligence!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the two were savoring their heartwarming exchange, a measured knock resonated against the ward door.</p>
