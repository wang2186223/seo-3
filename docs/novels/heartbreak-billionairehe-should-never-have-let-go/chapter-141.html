                <p>Music pulsed through the room as Seville and the others danced, but Brandon stood still outside,unmoving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were bloodshot, fixed on the tightly closed door of the private room across the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, a cleaner was mopping the floor, humming to,herself, pleased with the generous tip she&#39;d received from Charles to just sweep up the broken glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me, could you lift your feet?&#34; she asked politely,looking up at Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden, noticing Brandon&#39;s increasingly tense expression, tried to steer him away. &#34;Our room&#39;s just next door. I doubt they&#39;ll be coming out anytime soon. Let&#39;s wait in there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon finally tore his gaze from the door and  followed Darden into the neighboring suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they left, the cleaner finished her task, still humming as she patted the pocket where the tip rested and exited the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside Millie&#39;s private room, the atmosphere was completely different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia, still fuming, pulled out her phone and brought up the gossip showing Brandon and Vivian having a candlelit dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held the screen up and snapped, &#34;Unbelievable.Does Brandon seriously think he can just be with Vivian now and then crawl back to Millie later? He wants to have it all. How disgusting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others voiced their support, exchanging looks of disapproval and making faces at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie, despite everything, felt a quiet sense of warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Painful as her past had been, she was thankful to be surrounded by people who genuinely cared for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for now, that was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget them. We&#39;re here to celebrate tonight, so let&#39;s enjoy ourselves,&#34; she said, raising her glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere lightened, and the handsome escorts hired for the party did their part to liven things up. Laughter and music filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But while Millie&#39;s room was buzzing, the mood in Brandon&#39;s was somber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drank one glass after another, not sipping-chugging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden sighed and reached for the bottle, sliding it out of Brandon&#39;s reach. &#34;Take it easy, man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon frowned, noticing his drink had disappeared, and reached to grab it, but Darden held it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon was frustrated, but Darden understood. If Alyssa were next door dancing and drinking with a bunch of guys, he wouldn&#39;t be calm either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to retrieve his drink, Brandon slumped back on the sofa, eyes on the ceiling as the colored lights from above flickered and spun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden pulled out his phone and opened the same article Alexia had shown Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, I get why she&#39;s angry. You had a candlelit dinner with Vivian. It&#39;s no wonder she&#39;s upset. That&#39;s probably why she&#39;s out there partying. Don&#39;t worry,though. Charles and Giffard are there. Nothing wil happen to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden tried to reassure his friend. But Brandon&#39;didn&#39;t react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was the alcohol, the sleepless nights, or both, his head spun, and his thoughts were muddy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t matter to him that Millie was mad at him about Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, all he wanted was to see her walk out of that room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the music next door was still blaring, and through the wall, he could even hear Alexia&#39;s off-key singing and Millie&#39;s laughter. It only made him feel worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, someone had tipped off the paparazzi after spotting Millie at the Blue Lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They waited, and soon enough, the scene outside the private rooms gave them what they wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They couldn&#39;t get close, but from a distance, they captured photographs of the argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photos and gossip spread quickly online,even overtaking the latest buzz about Serena.#MillieAtBlueLounge,#MillieAndBrandonBothFoolingAround,#BrandonDiningWithVivianWhileMilliePartiesAtBlueLo unge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Internet was ablaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoa, looks like Millie&#39;s done playing the quiet wife!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This drama&#39;s better than TV. Keep it coming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t wait for the next twist!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t care who&#39;s right-I just want the show!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, none of them seem great, but at least Vivian stands for something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian stared at her screen, fuming. The cup in her hand slammed onto the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should&#39;ve gone to the Blue Lounge with Brandon. Millie had probably been waiting, keeping tabs through Darden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That conniving woman!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had thought Millie had given up, but no. She was lying low, planning her comeback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s hands trembled with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for her phone to make a call but  stopped herself. Instead, she pulled out a second phone and made a call using a different line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call connected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; a voice answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The information I asked for earlier-what&#39;s the update? Did the person survive?&#34; Vivian asked,deliberately lowering her voice to a hoarse rasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean the person got hit outside the city?&#34; The sound of typing followed. &#34;Hang on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few moments passed. &#34;He survived. Barely. The&#39;prognosis isn&#39;t good. He&#39;s in a vegetative state.Might wake up, but chances are slim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; she said, and ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned the phone off and let out a long breath,finally relaxing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Elliott Mansion, Myron sat with a kitten curled beside him, skimming through a stack of reports.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Jayceon was raging over a losing streak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh! Lost again! Trash game, useless teammates!&#34;he yelled, tossing the console aside and grabbing his phone to scroll through video reels. But a few clips in, he suddenly sat upright, coughing. &#34;Gosh!Myron!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hurried over, holding out his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at this! Millie&#39;s really out there tonight! I bet Brandon&#39;s losing his mind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then he paused, remembering something.&#34;Right... Sorry. I forgot about the whole failed proposal this morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron glanced at the screen, adjusted his glasses,and let out a soft chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not mad?&#34; Jayceon asked, peeking at his brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s newly divorced. She deserves to celebrate,&#34;Myron replied calmly, eyes returning to the papers in  front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon gave a small nod and went back to his videos.</p>
