                <p>In a dimly lit bedroom at Crest Villa, Crobert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After their intimate encounter, Brandon Watson brushed his lips against the small mole on Millie Bennett&#39;s chest softly, and then sat up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said in a detached voice, &#34;Let&#39;s get a divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie, still breathing hard from the encounter, turned to him slowly, a wild look of disbelief in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been married for a year. What did he mean by suddenly saying he wanted a divorce?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has stomach cancer and has only six months left to live,&#34; Brandon said, lighting a cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smoke rose in slow spirals around his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her final wish is to be my wife,&#34; he added, almost offhandedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gawked at him, stunned. Silence spread across the room like mist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bedside lamp glowed faintly, casting long shadows across the wall, making them seem farther apart than they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon glanced at her and gave a faint frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s only to comfort her,&#34; he explained. &#34;We&#39;ll.remarry after six months. She won&#39;t be here long,Millie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was steady, almost detached, like someone passing along a message that didIn&#39;t concern him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie watched Brandon wordlessly, her eyes fixed on his profile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke like his words were instructions, not suggestions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their relationship had always been one-sided. She had chased it from the start, drawn in by youthful affection.She had stayed by his side for years, moving through each rough season without letting go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie still remembered that day, under the heavy rain that soaked them both, Brandon had stood between her and her stepfather, gripping a cracked stick,and said with fire in his voice, &#34;Touch Millie again, and you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That moment had etched itself into her heart.Even when she was weak and bleeding, she saw him-unmoving, protective,fierce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that point on, she was his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She loved him without pause, met his requests with everything she had, carrying them out more flawlessly than anyone else ever could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would always pat her head, light and warm, and say in a low voice, &#34;You did so well, Millie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon&#39;s praises never lasted, his kisses barely stayed, and whatever affection they shared always felt just out of reach. But Millie told herself it was justhow he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when others called her naive, she stayed-devoted and trusting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had given seven years of her life to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A year earlier, Brandon&#39;s grandfather, Derek Watson,had fallen into poor health. The family, hoping to lift his spirits, decided Brandon should marry. Perhaps the joy of a wedding would give the old man something to hold on to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Brandon went on to marry Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought it was finally their moment. But after the vows, something changed. He began to pull away.Sometimes, he looked at her like she was a stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, are you listening?&#34; Brandon scowled as he caught the far-off look in Millie&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does it have to be like this?&#34; she asked softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer. Instead, he said, &#34;She&#39;s going through so much, Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie&#39;s chest tightened. &#34;And what about me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t answer right away. His eyes, dark and steady, flickered with a trace of impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, after about three seconds, he said, &#34;MAillie,she&#39;s dying. Maybe you don&#39;t know, but she&#39;s in love with me. Because we were married, and she didn&#39;t want to hurt you, she never let things go too far between us. Even when I tried to make it up to her,she never let me. She&#39;s a good person. Please, let her have this. Don&#39;t make me think you&#39;re being heartless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words, spoken so calmly, pierced her more than if he had shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So in Brandon&#39;s eyes, a woman in love with a married man, who promised to hold back but never really let go, was a saint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And a wife who simply wanted to keep her husband to herself was heartless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stared at his face. The same face she had fallenfor-intense eyes, prominent nose, beautiful lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had things started to crumble?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was the day the woman showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure this is wwhat you want?&#34; Millie asked,steadying herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon said nothing, pursing his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he opened his mouth to respond. &#34;Yes, you-&#34;&#34;Alright.&#34; Millie cut him off before he could finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon looked up, clearly surprised. He frowned,studying her closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, you&#39;re getting clever,&#34; he said, a flicker of irritation in his voice. &#34;You know I need your consent to go through with it. Are you thinking of using it to get under my skin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t answer. She just stared at the white wall,watching how their shadows stretched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon put out his cigarette and said no more,pulling on his clothes quickly and storming out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t stop to consider how she felt. Nor did he pause to acknowledge how humiliating or painful his request was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew she couldn&#39;t leave him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was utterly sure about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door slammed shut behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, Millie was alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat motionless by the bed, staring at the door as if it might open again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone buzzed beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A message lit up the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was from a familiar number. &#34;He came to see me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The text came with a photo. Brandon&#39;s face was captured in the reflection of a glass door, a soft smileplaying on his lips, eyes warm in a way Millie had never seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She froze. Then, slowly, she scrolled upward through the previous messages. &#34;He said he has feelings for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rainy nights aren&#39;t lonely for me because he&#39;s here with me.What about you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The one who isn&#39;t loved is truly the other woman.Millie, you were never his first choice; you were just the one he settled for. He sees beauty the way I do,shares my taste in things, and he loves me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The messages continued that way, proving Brandon&#39;s betrayal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man who had always treated her with distance these past seven years had apparently mastered tenderness for someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie kept scrolling until she reached the very first message. &#34;You should know who l am. Do you like the flowers in your living room today? I sent them. Hesaid they were beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, Millie knew who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian Simpson, the famous floral designer known for filling her wealthy clients&#39; grand villas and lavish parties with carefully and beautifully arranged blooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had shown Brandon the messages before.He&#39;d brushed them off and said there was no proof they were from Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had even said maybe Millie sent them herself just to stir trouble. Most of the messages didn&#39;t have pictures, and the few that did were vague-taken from afar, hard to pin down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But not today&#39;s. Today&#39;s was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie thought about showing him the photo. Then her eyes drifted toward the bedside drawer. She reached down and pulled it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There it was. The pregnancy test result she&#39;d gotten earlier that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was pregnant with Brandon&#39;s child. At the worst possible moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tears fell, soaking the paper and smudging the ink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what did it matter anymore? Brandon&#39;s heart had been gone for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie wiped her face dry and picked up the lighter he&#39;d left behind. Flames flickered as she held the test result to the fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon had no idea that saying yes to the divorce would be the final thing she&#39;d ever do for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had given him back what she owed-not in money, but in seven full years of her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would never love him again.</p>
