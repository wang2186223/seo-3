                <p>Myron held Brandon against the wall with one hand.With the other, he pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and shoved it roughly into Brandon&#39;s mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He jammed it in again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Filthy mouth like yours,&#34; he said. &#34;Needs proper cleaning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon struggled violently. The two were evenly matched,but he finally managed to free one arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ripped the handkerchief out and spat bloody saliva onto the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They locked eyes, breath heavy, tension thick between them.Then Brandon laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lookedat Myron like he was seeing through him.&#34;What, that made you angry?&#34; he sneered. &#34;I only said the truth. Everyone in Crobert knows I was her husband. What&#39;s the point of all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s voice turned colder. &#34;Everyone also knows you&#39;re divorced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed Brandon harder against the wall. &#34;My feelings for Millie don&#39;t change because she was once married to you. If anything, I&#39;m glad you lost her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon opened his mouth to reply, but Myron didn&#39;t give him the chance. He pushed harder, locking him in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t talk about her the way you just did. Not to you,not to anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked Brandon straight in the eye. &#34;She hasn&#39;t agreed to be with me. Yes, it was just a meal. But that doesn&#39;t matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s voice remained steady. &#34;She walked away from you. And now she chooses to spend time with me. That&#39;s the reality-that&#39;s what matters. The woman you couldn&#39;t cherish, the one you tossed aside like nothing-she&#39;s a treasure to me. And not just to me.&#34; He leaned in slightly. &#34;You made your choice, Brandon. You don&#39;t get to be possessive anymore. Especially not toward someone who no longer belongs to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With each word, Brandon&#39;s face grew darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he broke free of Myron&#39;s grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two stood across from each other, silent in the dim stairwell, eyes filled with mutual contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;ll come back to me,&#34; Brandon said, voice low and raw. His eyes were bloodshot, almost wild. &#34;You don&#39;t understand anything. She&#39;ll come back.We&#39;ve been through everything together. You have no idea what that means.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;Maybe you did go through a lot,&#34; he replied. &#34;But you still hurt her. You left her for Vivian. Did you ever stop to think what that did to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at Brandon, unwavering. &#34;Sometimes I can&#39;t help but wonder,&#34; Myron said. &#34;Did you ever actually love her? If you did, how could you do what you did?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon looked down. His hair fell over his face,hiding his expression in shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t come back here,&#34; Myron said. &#34;Don&#39;t showN up at her door again. I&#39;ll make sure she&#39;s protected.Even if you bring the full weight of the Watson Group against me, I&#39;ll still stand right here. I won&#39;t let you hurt her again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t speak. Half his body was hidden in the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, slowly, he lifted his head and looked at Myron.His fists were clenched, and the reopened wounds on his arms were bleeding again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He studied Myron&#39;s face for a long time, as if trying to understand something he couldn&#39;t accept. But finally, he shut his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll never understand,&#34; he said. He then turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he passed Millie&#39;s door, he paused. He looked at it for a moment, but then lowered his eyes and walked to the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corridor fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The green glow from the emergency exit sign flickered across his face, painting him in alternating light and dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched as the elevator descended. Then he bent down, picked up the crumpled handkerchief,and tossed it into the trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a quiet moment, he stepped out of the stairwell and stopped at Millie&#39;s door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knocked twice, gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It opened a few seconds later. Millie stood in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s handled,&#34; Myron said with a quiet smile. &#34;He won&#39;t come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie glanced down the hallway, toward the elevator.Then she nodded. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get some rest,&#34; he told her. His voice was gentle,but he didn&#39;t step any closer. &#34;Goodnight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You too,&#34; she said. &#34;Goodnight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she hesitated and added softly, eyes lowered,&#34;I&#39;ve said it already, but... thank you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, hs smile deepened. &#34;You don&#39;t have to thank me,silly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up at him. Under the warm light pouring out from her apartment, he looked calm and steady.Something about it left her feeling unsure of what she was feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should go,&#34; she said. &#34;Take care on your way back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, gave her one more glance, and then turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stood at the doorway and watched him en</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the elevator. She didn&#39;t move for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after the doors closed did she slowly turn, step inside, and close the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Brandon sped through the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words Myron had said echoed in his mind, over and over, cutting into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he love Millie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he not?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the car engine felt distant, muffled beneath the weight in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drove aimlessly. He didn&#39;t know where he was going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was slipping through his fingers, and he had no way to stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was in pain-deep, relentless pain-and didn&#39;t  know how to escape it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered what he had said earlier, how low he had sunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t stop thinking about her. Her tears. Her laughter. Her shy smile. Her trembling voice whispering his name during long, intimate nights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had it all fallen apart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t even recognize himself anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The city lights faded as he reached the outskirts. The road was empty. He slammed the brakes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car skidded to a stop in the dark countryside.Only the sound of insects filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned forward, forehead pressed to the steering wheel.Tears rolled down his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lowered head brushed the horn. It blared loudly into the empty night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long, hollow sound. Like grief, spilling into the void.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;ll come back,&#34; he whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know who he was trying to convince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She hasn&#39;t said yes to Myron. She&#39;ll come back to me.&#34; Again and again, he repeated those words, as if saying them enough could make them true.</p>
