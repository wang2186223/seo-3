                <p>Charles cut in, tugging Brandon to the side with a scowl. &#34;Listen up, Brandon. I might not be as powerful as you, but you don&#39;t get to walk all over my friends.Not happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then shot Barbara a pointed look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara got the message, slipping over to help Millie up the steps and into the RV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Millie&#39;sfoot landed on the first stair, Brandon&#39;s voice cut through the tension behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And who exactly are you, Serena?&#34; Brandon demanded sharply, a flicker of challenge in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles froze, momentarily thrown off, his gaze drifting silently to Millie for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without turning, Millie answered, her tone calm and precise, &#34;Mr. Watson, if you&#39;ve got doubts, make it clear.Otherwise, I have nothing to add.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s stare lingered on her silhouette. &#34;With the kind of talent and skill you&#39;ve shown, there&#39;s no way you&#39;re just some nobody,&#34; he noted, his voice steady but firm. &#34;So tell me-what are you really after?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you even care?&#34; Charles snapped angrily before Millie had a chance to speak. &#34;Seriously, what else could a singer possibly be after for joining a music show?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounded almost exasperated, as if Brandon&#39;s line of questioning defied all logic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s reply was a single, frigid glance-an unspoken dismissal that made Charles look foolish just for asking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie instantly grasped Brandon&#39;s point. She knew he was hinting at the whole situation with Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39; outburst, however, came as a welcome distraction, sparing her from the need to reply at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the moment, Millie moved to climb into the RV,her mind already shifting ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon&#39;s voice cut through the air behind her. &#34;I&#39;m not here to interrogate you,&#34; he called in an even tone.&#34;Vivian&#39;s my responsibility-I&#39;ll deal with her problems myself.Whatever plans you have, just keep what I said in mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie froze before turning to face him at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon remained where he was, the darkness at his back stretching on forever. A restless breeze flicked across the night, tossing a stray lock of hair over his brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this supposed to be a warning or just a notification?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t bother with the usual appeals to Vivian&#39;s fragile health or so-called kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Brandon skipped any pretense of explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spelled it out for her: No matter what she did, he&#39;d side with Vivian. He wanted her to know-before she made her move-she had better think hard about whether she was really ready to challenge him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s lips curved into a faint, ironic smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this his idea of love?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If what he felt for Vivian was love, then what had all those stolen hours and whispered words between them ever meant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite all her efforts to break away from them,they refused to let her go, cornering her at every turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxiety and fury twisted inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fists curled tight at her sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, both Millie&#39;s and Charles&#39; phones buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie slid hers out, her pulse stuttering as she read the group chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville had just dropped a bombshell-news of Vivian&#39;s latest move, complete with a string of links.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Serena&#39;s scandalous private life exposed-she suffered a miscarriage just ten days before the first &#39;Heavenly Melody&#39; live show.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Charles&#39; sponsorship of Serena on &#39;Heavenly Melody &#39;was allegedly compensation for her recent loss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Serena faked a donation at the Evans charity gala-her name was missing from the official list, yet she showed up and joined the donors&#39; group photo.Totally unethical.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles had seen theaccusations too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t naive at all. Holding up the screenshots before Brandon, he huffed, &#34;I know why you&#39;re here,but take a look at this first. Is this really the &#39;kind&#39;Vivian you&#39;re defending?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s mouth tightened. His gaze flicked toward the car door, but the mysterious woman behind the mask had already slipped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Done shouting, Charles lost interest in the argument.He stormed off and climbed into the RV without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engine rumbled to life, and the vehicle rolled smoothly past Brandon, who raised his eyes just in time to glimpse Serena&#39;s masked silhouette through the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the makeup artist began her work,efficiently stripping away the remnants of the performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the mask, Serena&#39;s skin was bare-only her jaw and lips had been touched with makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara glared at her phone, cheeks flushed with anger. &#34;Unbelievable! How can someone stoop so low?| actually thought Vivian was kind and decent, you know? She used her own struggles to lift up others fighting illness, and I thought it was so inspiring. But now-seeing all this made up... Mr. Evans, Serena,what&#39;s our move? And what about Mr. Watson, still backing Vivian? Are we just letting him go unchecked?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles clearly wanted to strategize with Millie, but with Barbara listening, he stayed noncommittal,assuring her they&#39;d take care of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midway through the drive, Millie and Charles left the RV behind for the quiet privacy of his Bentley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the doors shut, Millie tugged off her mask,finally able to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles, eyes fixed on the latest headlines, asked quietly, &#34;What do you think?&#34; His phone glowed in his hand as scandal after scandal poured in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually, Serena was untouchable-petty gossip never stuck for long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So what if Serena was seeing someone? Those could be shrugged off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, things were different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39; &#34;sponsorship&#34; could be brushed off as tabloid fodder or baseless gossip, but a fake charity donation...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles set his jaw, replying, &#34;That&#39;s where things got tricky-Serena&#39;s name wasn&#39;t anywhere on the official list that day. You told me to keep the donor&#39;s identity under wraps, so the tanzanite&#39;s real source was never made public.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena had bought Ari&#39;s painting, but thanks to her fierce bidding duel with Brandon earlier that night,her number stood out. To keep things quiet, she&#39;d ended up using Charles&#39; bidding paddle, so naturally, the name &#34;Serena&#34; never appeared on the auction recordds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the elaborate precautions they&#39;d taken to shield her identity were now backfiring spectacularly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fake charity donation wasn&#39;t some minor scandal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a celebrity, it was career-ending. Anyone linked to such a controversy was instantly blacklisted from the industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even Evans Entertainment&#39;s connections could offset that kind of stain-no investor wanted anything to do with a star whose reputation was this toxic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie scrolled through the relentless barrage of online comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any praise for Serena&#39;s talent had evaporated; the narrative had flipped, and now every word was vicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That event was a charity gala to raise funds for kids with critical illnesses. I remember Serena pushing hard to publicize her involvement-she even went head-to -head with Brandon in a bidding war.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah! Even if she managed to win a bid, it didn&#39;t qualify as a fake donation. The children&#39;s artwork at the event wasn&#39;t even pricey. Using those kids&#39; stories for publicity without spending a dime? That&#39;s just plain sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And she actually had the nerve to pose with the real donors for a group photo. Talk about shameless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Talent&#39;s one thing, but she&#39;s rotten inside. What does it matter how gifted she is if she&#39;s tied up in scandals -phony charity donations, selling herself for personal gain? Just those two alone are enough to ruin her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Serena can walk away from this and win in this show,then showbiz is truly hopeless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed! If she gets away with this, what about my idol? They were blacklisted for far less.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same here. My favorite used to be an A-lister, but one scandal and they were gone for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If someone like Serena can stay in the spotlight,then I want justice for my idol, too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The online backlash exploded, and Serena&#39;s support nosedived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie and Charles kept a close watch, but they weren&#39;t the only ones-Brandon was tracking every new development,too.</p>
