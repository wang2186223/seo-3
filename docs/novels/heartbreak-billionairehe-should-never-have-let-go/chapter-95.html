                <p>When Millie didn&#39;t respond, Brandon continued gently, &#34;r&#39;H take over Arl&#39;s tréatment. Pll bring in the best medical team. She&#39;ll get better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s my child, Brandon. You don&#39;t need to worry about her,&#34; Millie finally said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, she made up her mind not to take his money anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had any decency left, he&#39;d return the Bennett family&#39;s possessions once the divorce was finalized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would be fair compensation for everything she had done for him over the years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Giffard is a skilled doctor. He&#39;l take good care of Ari,&#34; she added, her tone calm but firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s temper flared again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t she my child too?&#34; he snapped. &#34;Do you even hear yourself right now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie clenched her fists. She wanted to answer back, but stopped herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a week remained before the divorce could be finalized. Just seven days to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t afford to make things more complicated now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also, Ari would be legally adopted under her mother&#39;s name. Brandon would never have any claim to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon wasn&#39;t done. &#34;I know you and Alexia are close-that&#39;s fine. But what&#39;s really going on between you and Giffard?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked up, disbelief crossing her face. &#34;Are you seriously accusing me now? There&#39;s nothing between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave a bitter laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He locked eyes with her, his voice cold. &#34;I saw it myself. You and him were getting a little too close in that hospital room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie paused, thinking back. Then it clicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So that was you standing outside the hospital room door?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer. Just stared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that supposed to be a confession? That he&#39;d caught her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She actually found it absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh escaped her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And who exactly are you to judge me?&#34; she asked, a faint smile playing on her face. &#34;You think P&#39;m the one in the wrong? Your affair with Vivian is public knowledge. And now you&#39;re here,trying to lecture me about inappropriate relationships? Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s just a little hypocritical?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had never been anything inappropriate between her and Giffard. She&#39;d made that clear to him that day, and nothing had happened since.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even if there had been-so what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s jaw tensed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So which one is it? Giffard? Charles?&#34; he asked after a long pause. someone else entirely? What&#39;s the goal here? To make me jealous? Get me to leave Vivian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t stop. &#34;I&#39;ve told you before, Millie. You&#39;ll always be my wife. Just wait six more months. Vivian won&#39;t be in the picture much longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed and said sharply, clearly irritated, &#34;Whatever this is, just stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie studied the man in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half his face was cast in shadow, but his eyes remained vivid, piercing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She used to love those eyes, especially when they reflected her, made her feel like she was the center of his world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, those same eyes were hiding someone who could say such heartless things. He was defending another woman while telling her not to make a scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he truly belleve she belonged to him, no matter what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence settled between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the dim light, the only thing that sparkled was her earring catching the faint glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Brandon&#39;s phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled f out, and Milie saw the name on the screen: Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked away and smiled faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone kept vibrating, but he made no move to pick it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not going to answer?&#34; Millie said, her voice edged with sarcasm. &#34;Maybe she fainted again. You should go check on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; Brandon snapped, unable to hold back any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hated it when she talked to him like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie just stared at him coolly, that same composed smile still on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gripped his phone tightly, as if about to speak-but thought better of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, he slipped it back into his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,nearby, someone&#39;s chain-strap purse knocked into a table, sending a bottle of red wine crashing to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It shattered on impact, wine spilling across the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh! Mr. Watson, I&#39;m so sorry!&#34; that woman exclaimed, rushing to get a waiter to clean the mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound and sight snapped Brandon back in time-to that year when he and Millie had gone on a business trip to Vascuosia. The hot spring hotel. The wine. The laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if they want us to drink, Brandon? I&#39;m not sure how much I can handle,&#34; Millie had asked back then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d heard that the client they were scheduled to meet in three days had a fondness for alcohof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon had smiled reassuringly. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. You won&#39;t have to drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the time, Watson Group was in a period of transition-welf-established in Crobert, but still struggling to gain a foothold in the new sector.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even ifit comes to that, I&#39;ll take care of it,&#34; he promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie had smiled, glancing at the wine bottle the client had sent over. &#34; want to share the burden with you. Why don&#39;t we try it now? Let me see how much I can hand//she said, still smiling.&#34;That way,I&#39;ll know my limit before the meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious?&#34; he&#39;d asked, looking into her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t reply. Instead, she reached for the bottle, opened it with steady hands, poured two glasses and handed one to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took it, and she tapped her glass gently against his. Her eyes sparkled with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To landing this contract,&#34; she said, and then tipped her glass back and finished it in one go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched her, smiling, and mirrored her action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She poured a second round and raised her glass again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To your health and happiness, Brandon.&#34; Another glass down in a single breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The alcohol brought a warm flush to her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, snow fell thick and fast. Inside the hotel room, the air was warm and inviting</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought she looked absolutely adorable, and leaned in to kiss her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips tasted like red wine and laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m still fine!&#34; she declared, nudging him playfully as she poured another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This one&#39;s for Watson Group&#39;s smooth transition... and this one&#39;s for you, Brandon.May you always stay as handsome as you are!&#34; she added with a soft laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They Jost count of how much they drank. Bottle after bottle arrivred at their room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, she began to sway slightly, glass still in hand. &#34;This one... she sfarted. She looked at him,eyes soft, heart open. &#34;This one&#39;s for out everlasting happiness, Brandon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she only managed to take a few small sips from that last glass. She was too dlzzy to finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed her again, holding her by the waist as wine spilled unnoticed onto the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere turned electric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll be happy,&#34; he whispered, his voice low, rough with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled her onto his lap. Their breath mingled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, they lost track of kisses, of time, of limits. They tried new things-there in the room, and again in the hot spring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Red wine stained the floor. Her skin carried the scent of him and the wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the wine tasting event, a waiter arrived to clean the mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The red liquid was wiped away slowly, methodically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie turned aside, lost in the memory of that winter in Vascuosia. It had been so bitterly cold outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Al cleaned up,&#34; the waiter said, collecting the broken glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman who had knocked the bottle apologized once more before hurrying off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stared at the floor as it slowly dried. For reasons he couldn&#39;t name, the sight left him deeply unsettled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had once loved each other fiercely. Endured so much together. Now, all of it felt impossibly distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where had it all gone wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know. So he stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At some point, the phone in his pocket had stopped buzzing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, they just sat there, a heavy blanket of silence hanging between them</p>
