            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>&#34;The full details are online. You can check it out-l&#39;ve sent the link,&#34; Eugene said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek, on the other hand, still looked furious and struck Brandon with his cane a few more times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon didn&#39;t react. It was as if he felt no pain at all. He simply ended the call and opened the link Eugene had sent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just ten minutes earlier, a rumor had begun picking up momentum-Vivian had joinedthe charity gala to support sick children, while Millie had shown up only to make trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s PR team, led by Johnny, was fanning the flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They started by pushing the narrative about the tanzanite&#39;s mediocre value.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The tanzanite was valued simply around one million. Usually, it wouldn&#39;t go beyond 1.2 million, even in an charity auction. Vivian made a reasonable bid. But Millie kept raising it, forcing the price up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. If Millie really wanted it, she would&#39;ve started bidding from the start. It&#39;s obvious se only did it because Vivian wanted it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian&#39;s goal was to raise awareness for children in need. Millie? She just wanted to ruin it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.··</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had made no response so far. And to Vivian, that silence was victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, people had called Vivian the real fraud, but now, her team had turned the story around. &#34;She wanted to do charity work, and she did. It was Millie who kept pushing. Vivian had no choice but to give up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the blame sat squarely on Millie&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in the lounge was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian&#39;s team really knows how to spin a story. I wonder where she found people like that,&#34; Barbara said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles nodded. &#34;I still remember that one post boasting about her kindness and everything. That one really worked.People ate it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie also nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always known how good Vivian&#39;s PR team was at shaping the narrative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And sadly, she&#39;d been one of their targets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment&#39;s thought, Millie said, &#34;We&#39;re ready. Let&#39;s begin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles nodded and sent a message to Seville and the others in the group chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, out of nowhere, two statements appeared online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first was posted by Evans Entertainment&#39;s official account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It read, &#34;First, identity confirmation-Serena is Millie. This arrangement is backed by a confidentiality agreement. Second, because of that same agreement, Millie&#39;s identity had to be kept secret during the auction. Third, the originaI owner and donor of the tanzanite at the charity auction was Millie, though this was hidden due to the first two reasons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evidence was attached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second post came from Millie&#39;s personal account. It included her purchase receipt for the tanzanite and official documentation from Elliott Group&#39;s archive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elliott Group reposted it, confirming it was genuine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Internet exploded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at Moonlit Estate, Brandon read through everything in stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone now knew the truth-the tanzanite belonged to Millie. But only he knew what that really meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the birthstone she&#39;d picked out for their êhild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered the first time they saw it together. Her voice still echoed in his mind.&#34;Tanzanite represents love and eternity. Turquoise is supposed to bring victory and success. If I had to choose, I&#39;d go with tanzanite. Because I&#39;d want to tell our child their parents wvill always love them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands shook as he gripped the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, that day at the auction, he had publicly outbid her with 25 million and snatched the stone from her right in front of everyone-all for Vivian&#39;s sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie must have thought he&#39;d given the tanzanite to Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image of that deep blue gem-now locked away in his condo safe-flashed through his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Its glow felt like a stab to his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air around himn seemed to vanish. His chest tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is going on now? Is Vivian stirring up trouble again?&#34; Derek snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon just shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, he stood and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do you think you&#39;re going?&#34; Derek shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek hurled his cane. It hit Brandon hard in the leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stumbled but kept walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Seville and his team were still fueling the fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So that&#39;s it. Millie donated the tanzanite to charity. Everything went downhill just because the person who bid on it turned out to be her husband&#39;s lover.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who could take that lying down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right? Vivian was clinging to Brandon, dressed like a bride, and still had the nerve to bid on Millie&#39;s tanzanite!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put yourself in Millie&#39;s shoes-you&#39;d lose it too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why she kept raising the bid. Now it all makes sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Vivian&#39;s the other woman!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And now they&#39;re blaming Millie for everything? What a joke!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Brandon? He&#39;s completely lost it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it were me, I&#39;d drag those two cheaters out and confront them myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian, speak up! You&#39;re nothing but a shameless home-wrecker. Own up and apologize!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apologize,Vivian!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, public opinion flipped again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian, who&#39;d been basking in glory just minutes ago, now looked pale. She gripped her phone tightly,staring at Brandon&#39;s contact-but didn&#39;t press call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at Moonlit Estate, Brandon had returned his own villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the house, he paused. He remembered how Milie had slapped him there. Her eyes. Her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked back into the villa, recalling the kiss they shared at the entryway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He entered the same bedroom from that night. The moonlight looked just like before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was quiet. Still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at the bed, almost seeing the tracks of her tears on the pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in the corner was the button that had popped off when he&#39;d torn her shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her scent still lingered. But now, she was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence echoed her words from that rooftop moment during the auction break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson, you shouldn&#39;t let your concern reach past your partner, or else you&#39;ll only end up betraying her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, Serena had smiled at him. But Millie-Millie was crying inside.</p>
