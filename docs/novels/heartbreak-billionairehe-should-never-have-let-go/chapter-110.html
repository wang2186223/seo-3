                <p>As an elite caregiver, she had cared for many high-profile individuals and was well aware that the heads of major corporations often had prenuptial agreements to protect their assets in high-stakes marriages.Given that Brandon&#39;s wife had no notable background or leverage, the risk of a costly divorce was virtually nonexistent. So, she chose not to bring it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>··.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon sat in the back seat of the car.He pulled out his phone and called Eugene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Watson,&#34; Eugene answered promptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s something I need you to take care of,&#34;Brandon said, outlining the details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood, Mr. Watson. I&#39;ll begin preparing the materials right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, Brandon fell silent, lost in thought</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where to, sir?&#34; the driver asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just drive around,&#34; Brandon said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want to go back to the apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serenity Villa no longer felt like home since Millie had moved out. Without her, it was just an empty house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moonlit Estate wasn&#39;t an option either. His grandparents still refused to see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Millie&#39;s place... was closed off to him now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gazed out the window,taking in the glittering city lights. The nightscape was as dazzling as ever,but he felt disconnected from it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite being at the top of Crobert&#39;s social and financial ladder, he suddenly felt like an outsider in his own life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was happening to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned back in his seat and rubbed his temples, the weight of conflicting emotions pressing down on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver continued to cruise through the city in silence. Brandon stared absently out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shop fronts passed by. Bright displays flickered besides crowded sidewalks. It was lively. Then something caught his eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop here,&#34; Brandon said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped into a nearby mall. His gaze was drawn to racks of little girls&#39; dresses, colorful stationery,backpacks, and art supplies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He imagined Ari in one of those dresses-she would look lovely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered her passion for drawing, the quiet intensity she showed, and the genuine promise in her work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With proper support, she could become a true artist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guided by impulse, Brandon began selecting items.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His presence didn&#39;t go unnoticed, but when the staff approached,he simply gestured for them not to make a scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked out several dresses, art materials, and school supplies, and then paid and had everything packed neatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he returned to the car, the driver looked surprised but said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To the Crobert Children&#39;s Home,&#34; Brandon instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car pulled away smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he held the bags beside him, Brandon felt an unexpected sense of peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to see Ari. To bring her gifts.To make her feel cherished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, they arrived. Brandon spoke with the director and arranged a short visit in a designated meeting area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief wait, Ari appeared, slowly making her way toward him with a plush puppy toy clutched in her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t say anything. She simply sat on a nearby chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They sat in silence for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Brandon spoke up first. &#34;I brought you something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He placed the bags on the table and showed her one of the dresses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari looked at the dress briefly. &#34;Thank you, sir,&#34; she said politely, &#34;but I don&#39;t need it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Brandon gently moved the dress aside and brought out the backpack and art supplies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw your drawing at the kindergarten last time,&#34; he said. &#34;You&#39;re really talented.&#34; He laid the items out carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari looked at him but didn&#39;t reach for anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can give them to other kids here,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon studied her small face, unsure how to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari spoke again, softly but clearly. &#34;My mom will buy the things I need. And even if she&#39;s busy,Alexia and Charles will help. I&#39;m only staying here because the paperwork isn&#39;t finalized yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her plush toy slightly. &#34;Look, Alexia gave this to me. I really like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you like it, I can buy you more,&#34; Brandon offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari didn&#39;t answer. She just held the toy tightly and looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she said, &#34;Sir, don&#39;t you understand? I only accept things from my mom and her friends. I don&#39;t take things from anyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that modest children&#39;s home,she looked small and delicate, but there was strength in her voice, a quiet resolve that reminded him of Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please go back,&#34; she said gently. &#34;Don&#39;t come Looking for me anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon remained still, his hands clenched beneath the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must know about my relationship with Millie,&#34; he said. &#34;If you call her &#39;Mom,&#39; then you should call me &#39;Dad.&#39; There&#39;s nothing wrong with accepting these gifts from me. It&#39;s what I should do. I&#39;m not sure if your mother told you about me... but as my daughter,there&#39;s nothing in Crobert you couldn&#39;t have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled softly. &#34;I can help cure your illness, and support your dreams Just...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon paused, feeling a fragile vulnerability he&#39;d never experienced before. His eyes reddened slightly,but he kept his composure. &#34;All I ask,&#34; he said, &#34;is that you call me &#39;Dad.&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari looked at him steadily, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,finally,she asked, &#34;But are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stiffened slightly. She had seen his eyes, his hesitation. She understood. He wanted to know if Millie had put her up to this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari gently tugged at her toy&#39;s ears. &#34;Sir,&#34; she said, &#34;my mom is an amazing person. Before you came to me last time, she hadn&#39;t said a word about you. You forced her to reveal who you are. She didn&#39;t want to upset me, so she only said you were her husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I asked Alexia, but she wouldn&#39;t tell me anything either. It was only after I asked the director for help that I learned more about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze met his, clear and unwavering. &#34;I know there&#39;s someone named Vivian in your life. Every time I search your name, she comes up, not my mom. If she&#39;s the person you&#39;ve chosen, then maybe it&#39;s best if you stay with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice remained calm, but her words struck deep.&#34;Just... don&#39;t hurt my mom again.&#34;</p>
