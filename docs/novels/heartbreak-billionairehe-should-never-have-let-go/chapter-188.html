                <p>The Internet was ablaze with discussion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drama surrounding the Watson Group, Brandon,Vivian, and Millie had captured everyone&#39;s attention.The paparazzi kept stoking the flames, promising even more revelations. The frenzy only grew,pushing the story to the top of every trending feed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Elliott Mansion, Jayceon was thoroughly enjoying the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well done!&#34; he said with a big grin. &#34;Let&#39;s push these videos to even more viewers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept pumping money into boosting the clips,eager to drive up the views.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Between rounds of laughter, he showered the paparazzi with tips while his cat turned away,unimpressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two paparazzi were thrilled as views surged and advertisers began lining up for ad placements in their next uploads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s still plenty more to reveal. Aside from their date night, I&#39;ve got other content ready to go,&#34; one of them said while editing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other watched in admiration. &#34;You&#39;re seriously talented.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t even seen my best work,&#34; the first replied with a grin, diving back into his edits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online, the buzz only intensified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard Myron&#39;s been chasing after a mystery woman-turns out it&#39;s Millie! The way he looks at her is unreal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie hit the jackpot. First Brandon, now Myron?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s living the dream. Please let me swap lives with her for a few episodes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the sea, Millie and Myron were making their way back. Millie rinsed off the sand by the pool near the restaurant. Myron stood by, handing her a box of tissues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; she said, drying off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then offered her her heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded and took them. Her gaze flicked to his damp hair, and she looked slightly apologetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright,&#34; he said, understanding her concern.He picked up a towel and dried his hair. &#34;All good now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie smiled faintly and nodded again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They headed inside together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should probably head back,&#34; Myron said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone just uploaded videos of us here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He showed her the page, watching her closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does it bother you?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t the first time he&#39;d asked this question tonight, and she had already said no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie smiled. &#34;Not at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t married anymore. She wasn&#39;t interfering in anyone&#39;s relationship either. She and Myron were both single. There was nothing to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she agreed to go out with him, she&#39;d already made peace with the attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, they were only getting to know each other.Nothing was official yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No rule said a divorced woman couldn&#39;t spend time with a single man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, Millie looked at Myron. &#34;Thank you for today,&#34; she said sincerely. &#34;I really enjoyed it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron smiled back. His expression was calm, but there was deep tenderness in his eyes. &#34;Great, then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as she was happy by his side, he was more than satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They left together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, more paparazzi had found them, and people were beginning to gather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron had anticipated it. His bodyguards cleared a path as he shielded Millie and guided her to the car.They drove off quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As night fell, Millie sat in the back seat, gazing at the city lights through the window. The steady flow of cars and people grounded her in the present. It felt real-unlike the surreal haze she&#39;d felt earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered the window. The wind brushed her face.She took it in quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her, Myron watched her in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bentley stopped outside Millie&#39;s apartment building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the car came to a halt, she unbuckled her seatbelt and stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well then,I&#39;ll say good night,&#34; she said with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron nodded. &#34;Good night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and walked towards the building. Myron stayed by the car, watching until she disappeared into the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie entered the elevator, pressed her floor number,and watched the red digits rise. A strange feeling stirred in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator chimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped out and turned toward her apartment.But as she rounded the corner, she stopped.Someone was waiting outside her door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a man-his eyes bloodshot, his face pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no idea how long he&#39;d been standing there,but he looked tired and worn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he saw her, he stepped forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie turned to leave, but he grabbed her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze swept over her, taking in the blue dress.It was identical to the one in the videos online. His face twisted in fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were with Myron?&#34; he asked, his voice cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie pulled her shoulder free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him calmly in the dim hallway. His features were still as striking as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should be the one asking questions,&#34; she said.&#34;Why are you here? Why do you care?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon swallowed hard, trying to stay composed.&#34;Why did you go out with him? What did you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at him, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had chosen someone else. So why was he standing here, asking questions about her new relationship?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he think that because she once loved him, she would remain loving him forever?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everything-after the pain, after losing two children-did he expect her to still just wait for his return?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t that cheap. She wasn&#39;t that foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, we&#39;re divorced,&#34; she said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie...&#34; He tried to speak, but she cut him off.&#34;We&#39;re over. Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he kept staring. His eyes were red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just had dinner, right? That was all it was,wasn&#39;t it? The rest is just gossip, right?&#34; It was as if he hadn&#39;t heard anything she&#39;d said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie closed her eyes. She didn&#39;t want to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to unlock her door, but he yanked her back and slammed her against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer me!&#34; he shouted, his voice hoarse, his eyes burning with anger.</p>
