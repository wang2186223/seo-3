                <p>The scene was chaotic. Reporters jostled for space,while a flood of viewers watched the live stream online,all waiting for Brandon to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the conference room, Vivian kept a nervous eye on Brandon, while Millie watched Ari, who was fixated on Myron&#39;s cat. All the while, Brandon&#39;s reply lingered in their ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the flashing lights, Brandon finally broke his silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, &#34;About the first question-yes, there are feelings between Vivian and me. But my divorce from Millie was a mutual decision, and it has nothing to do with Vivian. About the second question, there are disagreements in some parts of the asset division and it may end up in court. So I can&#39;t say what exactly will be taken or left behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused for a moment, and then added, &#34;But like I said before, we signed a prenuptial agreement to protect the company&#39;s structure, so there won&#39;t be any complications about the shares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The press didn&#39;t let up. Cameras clicked, capturing  every word. Brandon&#39;s response and his defense of Vivian were already all over the Internet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie watched Brandon from the screen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, it was obvious he had forced the decision of a divorce on his own. She had asked him repeatedly but all he said was, &#34;Don&#39;t make me think you&#39;re being heartlesS.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was his version of&#34;mutual decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And still, he never once gave a straight answer about whether Vivian was the reason their divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All those days and nights spent holding each other through grief and joy. Years of sacrifice and survival.And now, it seemed, none of it mattered. Not next to someone he&#39;d known less than a year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reporter said again through the buzz,&#34;Mr.Watson,based on what you&#39;ve said, is Millie walking away with nothing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was very sensitive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie and Brandon had been together for years, and everyone in Crobert knew that. It wasn&#39;t some quiet affair or rumor without weight; they were legally married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being a loyal partner, Millie had stood by him through  the roughest times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With all eyes on him, Brandon lowered his face slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once the legal process is done, everything will be made public,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters made to ask more questions, but Brandon signaled that the press conference was over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson! Just one more...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,Mr.Watson!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t stop. His team closed in,and he walked away without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind the flash of lights, shareholders let out small sighs of relief. At least for now, it looked like the market might hold. But no one could predict what tomorrow would bring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing clear was that the Internet had erupted,buzzing with arguments and opinions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the noise circled around how Millie and Brandon&#39;s assets would be split.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seven years together and she didn&#39;t even get a dime?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even regular employees get severance after seven years of loyal service; how much more someone who was his wife!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s planning to toss her aside with a small check and a press statement? Money means little to Brandon.With shares in hand, he&#39;d make it all back before anyone could blink. The real power in the Watson Group lies in the shares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon is such a scumbag.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A real scumbag.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t stand him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y&#39;all see the bruise on his face? I don&#39;t care how he got it; he deserved worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The outrage grew, fast and loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Elliott residence, Myron clicked the remote,switching off the live feed. The room fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked at Myron,who stood nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood by the screen, face heavy, the usual mischief gone from his eyes. What was left was sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let it go-it&#39;s all in the past now,&#34; he said softly.&#34;The road ahead is still long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie glanced at Myron in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, he always knew when something weighed on her mind. And when he offered his comforting words and gestures, they were genuinely soothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was nothing like the connection she had shared with Brandon. With Brandon, it had always been about building something together-pushing, planning,enduring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Myron always showed up when the noise was too much. He rarely said much, but the little he did was enough to steady her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If this were years ago, when her heart was still soft and untouched, she might have dreamed of an intense love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, after all the heartbreak and storms, what she longed for was a simple and warm relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s on your mind?&#34; Myron asked gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt like she had seen him before. Not in business circles, but somewhere else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Little kitty-&#34; Ari quickly took the chance while the ragdoll cat was distracted and scooped it into a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cat, large and chubby, looked like it was trying to wriggle free without much effort. Its paws hovered over Ari, its wide eyes staring at the two adults as if begging for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cat let out a soft meow of protest while Ari held it close, rolling around together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie and Myron, who were watching, both wore smilés on their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time passed quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian and Brandon had finished their dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Brandon drove her back to her studio, the sky was fully dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They barely spoke on the journey</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stared out the window, lost in his own world.Beside him, Vivian was busy exchanging messages with Oakley under her alternate profile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had discussed many things. Then she sent her final message for the night. &#34;Whether we can make a big haul this time depends on how you and I handle it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian then locked her phone and put it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Brandon; watching his face,she  hesitated for a second and then softened her voice.&#34;Brandon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon glanced back at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll help you,&#34; Vivian said earnestly. &#34;Whatever she could do, I can do too. Maybe even better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t respond. He simply looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian smiled. &#34;Just trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon wasn&#39;t looking at Vivian. In his mind&#39;s eye,it was Millie he saw-Millie gripping his hand as they faced crises, Millie standing at his side when no one else believed in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, they were merely strangers to each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered the cold,determined look in her eyes when she stared at him at his office earlier that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s chest tightened with sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had done this. And now, if it weren&#39;t for the pressure from getting back what her father had left her or the bet she had with Vivian, Millie wouldn&#39;t even be in his orbit anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wondered for a fleeting moment if he had taken the wrong path. But regret was useless now. He had gone too far to turn back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he could do was cling to the Bennett family&#39;s properties and keep her bound to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the only path left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car sped through the night toward Vivian Floral Design.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that same moment, a fresh wave of gossip hit the entertainment	news	with the hashtag	#MyronDatingMysteryWoman</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photo showed a pair of figures from behind,standing by the river. Myron was gently placing a coat over an unknown woman&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The river breeze tugged at her long hair, and her face was turned away, hidden under the night. But it wasn&#39;t her face the Internet fixated on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the way Myron looked at her-softly, fully, like she was the only person in the world. Even in the dim light, the tenderness in his eyes couldn&#39;t be mistaken.</p>
