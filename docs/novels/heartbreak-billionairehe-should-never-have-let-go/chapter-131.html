                <p>Chapter, set it aside, picked up his coffee, and took a slow sip.His eyes settled on the courtyard, where the rain had begun to ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the city, the streets buzzed with motion as people started their day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the rain had ended just in time, the morning traffic remained jammed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had set out early, which allowed her to pick Ari up ahead of schedule. They spent some time playing at a quiet park before Millie dropped her off at kindergarten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once done, she made her way to the courthouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled into the parking lot, the documents needed resting on the seat beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would Brandon show up on time today? She wasn&#39;t sure,she could only wait and see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glance at her phone told her it was already 8:50a.m.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still no message from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As time crawled, at 8:55, just as she checked her screen again, a car horn sounded nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up to see a Maybach pulling into a spot not far from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hnad come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie inhaled quietly, grabbed the documents, and stepped out of her car. She walked over to the Maybach and knocked on the passenger-side window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glass lowered, revealing Brandon&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow of stubble had formed around his mouth and he hadn&#39;t changed out of the clothes he&#39;d worn the day before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nearly time. Did you bring everything?&#34; Millie asked, leaning slightly as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stayed quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s brow twitched as she watched him, unsure what was going through his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, he gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached over, gathered his documents, and climbed out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t speak as they walked side by side toward the courthouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few couples were already ahead of them,so they joined the line and waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More people arrived, some bickering in low voices,others standing in silence like they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon shifted his attention to Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still small in stature, flipping through the papers she&#39;d brought with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands were delicate, her ring finger bare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his gaze, pulled off his own wedding ring,and slipped it into his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie noticed but said nothing, offering him only a brief look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already left her ring, and the bottle of perfume he&#39;d once given her, in the drawer before leaving their shared home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep it for the remarriage,&#34; Brandon murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t reply. She kept reading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll buy you a better one next time,&#34; he added,maybe thinking she was annoyed and trying to reassure her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stayed quiet, her eyes lowered. She didn&#39;t want him to catch even a glimpse of what she was feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her silence drew a faint crease between Brandon&#39;s brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked drained. The shadows beneath her eyes hinted at a sleepless night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try to get some rest in the days ahead,&#34; he said, his voice low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked up briefly and saw the dark circles beneath his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; she murmured, bowing her head again. &#34;I&#39;ll take care of myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing more was said after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stood in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,it was their turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stepped up to the counter and passed over the required documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the clerk flipped through the paperwork, the two of them sat quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, the clerk looked up. &#34;Have you both made up your minds?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have,&#34; they answered together, nodding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With practiced hands, the clerk processed the forms and printed the final documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here you are,&#34; the clerk said, handing them each a divorce certificate and accompanying materials before calling the next couple forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie and Brandon stepped away from the counter,each holding a copy of their divorce certificate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stared at the piece of paper in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This marked the end of their marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange sense of relief washed over her-clearer and sharper than she expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,everything could move forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chaos that trailed behind Serena in the Heavenly Melody competition, the agreement she had signed with Brandon to ensure her rights, even the evidence of his affair she had once prepared as a last resort,none of it lingered over her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Ari, she belonged to her now, without question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that remained was to win the championship in that show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had originally planned to disclose her identity right after receiving the divorce decree. But with Brandon and the Elliott family tightening their grip on the show and on Serena&#39;s position, an early reveal wasn&#39;t necessary anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d wait until the finals. She&#39;d pull off the mask when the cameras were rolling and leave no room for retaliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now,Serena&#39;s image was being dragged through the mud online. But it wouldn&#39;t last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the finals, when she revealed who she really was,every rumor would crumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s thoughts raced, her next steps falling into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon was staring at his copy of the divorce certificate as well, though his thoughts couldn&#39;t have been further from Millie&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outwardly, they both looked composed as they stepped through the courthouse doors, neither showing any sign of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun had risen high, casting warmth over the pavement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, that&#39;s it. We&#39;re officially divorced,&#34; Brandon said as they stood on the steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave a slight nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In a few days, there&#39;s a music show final airing,&#34; he continued. &#34;It&#39;s called &#39;Heavenly Melody.&#39; You might like it. One of the contestants-Serena-she&#39;s really good. Talented and sharp. Her style reminds me of yours, only more polished. I admire her work.Thought you might want to watch and learn a few things. I&#39;ve set aside a seat for you at the live show.&#34;He looked at her. &#34;Think you&#39;ll come?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie met his eyes. &#34;I&#39;ll be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not with the audience though.&#34; Millie thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave a short nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing else to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie studied him for a moment, a quiet calm settling over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well then,&#34; she said, &#34;here&#39;s to new beginnings.</p>
