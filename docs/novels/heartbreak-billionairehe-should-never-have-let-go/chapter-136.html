                <p>Vivian pulled a folder from her bag. &#34;I brought all the paperwork we&#39;ll need. I even put on some makeup-do I look a little healthier now?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A comfortable warmth filled the CEO&#39;s office, and Vivian&#39;s smile gave her a certain charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face showed more color than usual, not nearly as washed out as before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope lit up her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was exhaustion or something deeper,Brandon couldn&#39;t bring himself to go through with a marriage today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s wait for another day,&#34; Brandon said quietly, his eyes dropping to avoid seeing the letdown in Vivian&#39;s expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rubbed his forehead. &#34;I&#39;m pretty worn out. And getting married still takes a little planning, doesn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian took in Brandon&#39;s tired face, his stubble showing, and saw just how drained he was. She decided not to push him further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she longed for the day everything would be official, eager to call herself Brandon&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t wait for the chance to parade her happiness in front of Millie, eager to see jealousy and pain in Millie&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about that moment, Vivian spoke again.&#34;Brandon, we don&#39;t need a big celebration. No ceremony, no party. I just want you. That&#39;s enough for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon still kept his gaze away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand you&#39;re exhausted, and there&#39;s been so much going on,&#34; Vivian added softly. &#34;I can be patient. Just... please don&#39;t make me wait forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Don&#39;t let me down,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian spoke with a calm kindness in her voice, the sort that left Brandon feeling slightly disarmed and unsure of how to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he managed a faint nod, giving his silent agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian gave a bright smile. &#34;Alright, Brandon, get some rest. I&#39;ll let you be for now,&#34; she said.&#34;What do you think about havingdinner together tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave a small nod, and only then did Vivian turn and leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he watched Vivian walk away, a wave of conflicting emotions stirred inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind drifted back to the memory of him and Millie beside his grandfather, sharing a solemn promise for his gravely ill grandfather&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon slipped his hand into his pocket and slowly pulled out the wedding ring, holding it in his palm for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light bounced off its surface, casting a chilly shine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d bought the set in a hurry that day, on the way back to Watson Mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After picking them out quickly, he slipped one ring onto Millie&#39;s finger, and she beamed with happiness,gently taking the other ring from his hand to slide it onto his finger herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, this is forever,&#34; she had said, her hand-now bearing a ring-holding his, and her eyes shiing with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That smile seemed like a distant memory now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, even though Millie had taken off her ring,he still had it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon held onto the hope that,one day, when they remarried, he&#39;d put it on her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Millie left Myron behind and headed straight to Evans Entertainment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already arranged with the designer to come check her outfit for the finals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she changed into the costume, Millie pulled on the matching mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reflection in the mirror made her smile with satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing nearby, the designer gave an approving nod as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try moving around a bit, and check if the joints work wel,&#34; the designer instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie went through her dance routine, the flexible joints of the costume allowing her to move with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks perfect.&#34; They both agreed,pleased with the results.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really can&#39;t wait to watch you take the stage in this,&#34; the designer said, eyes shining with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile spread across Millie&#39;s face as she nodded,sharing in the anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Serena, there&#39;s a lot of criticism online right now. Are you sure you&#39;re alright?&#34; the designer asked, concern creeping into their voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie reached out and gave the designer&#39;s arm a reassuring pat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take care of it,&#34; she remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The finals would be her chance to finally remove the mask. After that, there would be no room for doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the costume was settled, Millie took a brief rest before heading to the afternoon rehearsal for Heavenly Melody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since every broadcast aimed for top quality,all acts were required to rehearse. Back during the first rehearsal, Millie had been stuck in bed and couldn&#39;t make it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles later covered for her by altering the dates on her hospital records, making it seem like she got seriously injured ten days earlier, which made Vivian start suspecting Serena had ties to Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During earlier rehearsals, everyone kept to themselves, focusing on their own staging. This time,though,things felt different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Millie waited backstage, one of the contestants -Daphne Wendell-showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Daphne perched on Millie&#39;s makeup table, looking down with a cold expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Serena, I never thought you&#39;d actually show your.face here again.&#34; Daphne sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing just a simple mask, Millie shot Daphne a quick glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why wouldn&#39;t l?&#34; she answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daphne let out a loud, mocking laugh. &#34;Have you missed what&#39;s happening online? Have you not seen all the things they&#39;re saying about you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are people saying?&#34; Millie asked, genuinely  interested in Daphne&#39;s motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After several rounds of calm live broadcasts, it seemed Daphne had been waiting for the finals to stir up trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, Daphne simply handed Millie her tablet, the screen open to a page full of trending posts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One glance told Millie everything-negative hashtags were everywhere: #SerenaOutOfTheMusicScene,#SerenaOutOfTheCompetition #BoycottSerena,and #SerenaOrHeavenlyMelody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She barely glanced at the posts before turning back to her equipment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see all that?&#34; Daphne asked, wearing a sly smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw,&#34; Millie replied, her tone even and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I were you, l&#39;d quit the competition,&#34; Daphne sneered. &#34;So you wouldn&#39;t pull down the rest of the team with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s hands stilled as she studied Daphne&#39;s expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re saying you&#39;re only warning me for the sake of the production team?&#34; Millie asked, arching a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right,&#34; Daphne replied with total confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet laugh escaped Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a noble excuse!&#34; she said, easily seeing through the act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone competing had an agency backing them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News that the show wouldn&#39;t be cut off had reached every agency, and Daphne knew it as well as anyone.And it only made her claim almost laughable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daphne had come in second during the last round.If Serena bowed out, with the small gap in votes,Daphne stood the best chance at winning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The semifinals had already picked the top three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though the finals brought back former contestants for performances, the spotlight stayed fixed on the final trio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking Serena out left just a fifty-fifty shot between the other two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re all in the same business--let&#39;s just be honest here,&#34; Millie said plainly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daphne fell silent, glancing automatically at the seats out front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie followed her eyes and spotted Myron,coordinating with the staff from his place in the audience.</p>
