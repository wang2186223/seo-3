                <p>Millie glanced at Brandon, but his eyes stayed on the rain sliding down the window. He didn&#39;t look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did love him. But that was then. Now, she had chosen to stop loving him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no reason to say it aloud though-no need to stir up emotions before tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon turned his head just in time to see Millie stepping out into the rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bennett family&#39;s ties still randeep in the Watson Group, and digging into James&#39; death would take the right connections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed him. She needed the Watson name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon believed that in five months, when he told her everything, she would understand. He believed she still loved him. That she couldn&#39;t live without him.Now Millie was already walking ahead with Giffard and Alexia, disappearing into the rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The downpour was heavy. Even with an umbrella, her clothes clung to her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go get the car,&#34; Giffard said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia handed over the keys to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He jogged off, umbrella in hand, while Millie and Alexia waited under the shelter of a nearby roof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie brushed rain from her pants. Alexia noticed the redness in her eyes and hesitated before asking,&#34;What did he say to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just things from the past. He also talked about the accident... And said he didn&#39;t push me on purpose,&#34;Milie said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s face tightened. &#34;You&#39;re not thinking of forgiving him, are you? He&#39;s awful, Millie. He hurt you so badly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie shook off the last drops of rain and stood up straight. She smiled gently and patted Alexia&#39;s shoulder. &#34;No chance I&#39;ll ever forgive him. Tomorrow morning at 9, we&#39;re getting the divorce decree,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia studied her face, looking for any sign of hesitation. Seeing none, she finally exhaled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squeezed MMillie&#39;s hand. &#34;You&#39;ve been through enough. Don&#39;t look back. He&#39;s not worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie felt a dull ache in her chest. She held Alexia&#39;s hand tighter and nodded, &#34;I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,Giffard pulled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They returned the umbrellas to the kind officer,and then climbed into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Eugene borrowed an umbrella and walked over to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson, how did it go with Mrs. Watson?&#34;Eugene asked as he got into the driver&#39;s seat and wiped the rain off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t answer. He just stared out the window at the rain. He wasn&#39;t even sure how he felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Eugene didn&#39;t press further. He drove off, returned the umbrella, and had a few words with Brandon&#39;s lawyer. Then, he turned the car around and headed back with Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rain kept pouring. At home, Vivian paced the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been trying to reach someone, but the line wouldn&#39;t connect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last message she got said trouble was coming and he might go dark for a while. He also claimed he had cleaned things up for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it!&#34; Vivian cursed under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean, &#39;cleaned up&#39;?&#34; she muttered,eyes glued to the news on TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person who&#39;d been hit by the car was still</p>
                
                
                
                <p>critical. The police were already searching for the suspect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if he got away, he wouldn&#39;t be able to move freely in the city again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, the hunt had begun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank God for this rain. Maybe it&#39;ll wash away some evidence,&#34; Vivian murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she lay on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts drifted to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow... They should be able to get the divorce done smoothly, right?&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had it all planned. Once the divorce papers were signed, she&#39;d marry Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her &#34;last wish.&#34; And Brandon had to agree.Then she&#39;d finally be his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought lit up her face with a hopeful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rain drenched the city, soaking every corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giffard and Alexia dropped Millie off at her apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had taken a taxi earlier, so her car was still parked at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I stay with you?&#34; Alexia asked, her voice laced with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie shook her head. &#34;No need. You were frightened today. Go home, take a hot shower, relax a bit, and sleep well. Don&#39;t catch a cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia nodded. Truth be told, she might just wake Millie up with a nightmare if she stayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll get going then. Call me if anything happens,&#34;she said with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie smiled and nodded to reassure her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood quietly after they drove off, and then turned and walked slowly to the elevator, her steps heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In another car, Eugene asked carefully, &#34;Mr. Watson,where should we go now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t answer right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Brandon&#39;s phone vibrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at the screen. It was Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated, but then answered, recalling something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon,&#34; Vivian said shyly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you now?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m in the car,&#34; Brandon said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not with Millie, are you? I saw some gossip online about... your dinner with her tonight,&#34; she pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I&#39;m with Eugene,&#34; Brandon replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene added smoothly, &#34;Miss Simpson, we&#39;re heading back now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian let out a breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she said softly, &#34;Sorry, Brandon...I got jealous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t respond. He kept watching the rain roll down the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did she still agree to the divorce?&#34; Vivian asked after a pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good,&#34; Vivian whispered. Silence followed.Then, she said, &#34;Brandon... Where are you going now? Do you want me to stay with you tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon lowered his gaze. &#34;It&#39;s been a long day.I just want to be alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh... Okay. Take good care of yourself,&#34; Vivian replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will,&#34; he said, and then hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended. Brandon suddenly felt drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day had dragged on endlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Maybach rolled through the rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To Serenity Villa,&#34; Brandon instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Mr. Watson,&#34; Eugene said, setting the GPS.They arrived soon after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stepped out, crossed the wet courtyard,and entered the house. He turned on all the lights.Still, the place felt hollow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t go to the bedroom. He lay down on the sofa instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at the ceiling, he felt like he didn&#39;t belong to this world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone buzzed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clock had just struck midnight.</p>
