                <p>Millie studied the document in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever Brandon was trying to achieve,compensate her or buy her silence, it didn&#39;t matter. It wouldn&#39;t change anything she had planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with the Elliott family,though.Ask them when you have a chance, maybe?&#34;Charles thought for a while and added, &#34;Maybe it&#39;s just because Jayceon&#39;s a hardcore fan. You might want to send him a few more autographs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave no response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She might look into the Elliott situation later, but right now, only two things mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting ready for the finals of Heavenly Melody and ending her marriage to Brandon once and for all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her schedule for the day was packed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reinserted Serena&#39;s SIM card into her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheridan had already installed a blocking system, so harassing messages and prankcalls were no longer a problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, her inbox had been filled with qulestions from people fishing for information about her connection to both the Watson and Elliott Groups. She ignored every single one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hours slipped by before she knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That afternoon, Millie headed out to pick Ari up from school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spotted the girl easily in the sea of uniforms. Ari had seen her too and was already making her way over, smiling brightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie bent down to hug her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie!&#34; Ari beamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sweetheart!&#34; Millie brushed the dust off Ari&#39;s sleeves, smoothing out her clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you hungry? Want some snacks?&#34; she asked playfully, giving her cheek a light pinch. &#34;Anything but -</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ice cream!&#34; they both said at once, bursting into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari couldn&#39;t eat ice cream for health reasons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had become a running joke between them,one that showed just how in tune they were lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she&#39;d tidied Ari up, Millie brought her over to a nearby gazebo and handed her the water bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari had something on her mind. She&#39;d been thinking about Brandon&#39;s visit the night before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, can I ask you a question?&#34; she asked, finally deciding to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie took the bottle from her and gave her full attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d had a feeling this was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari took a breath, and then asked carefully,&#34;Do you still have feelings for Brandon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t know why Ari would ask that, but her answer came easily. &#34;I don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari looked visibly relieved. Millie couldn&#39;t help but let out a soft laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; she asked gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari looked down. &#34;He came to visit last night. He brought me a bunch of gifts, but I didn&#39;t accept any of them.&#34; She paused, recalling the events of the previous night, and then added, &#34;Afterward, I heard the director saying he made a huge donation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s brows tightened as she listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon had shown up to see Ari last night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A breeze drifted past, stirring the quiet afternoon. Not far away, a sleek Maybach pulled up and came to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the back seat, Brandon caught sight of Millie and Ari near the gazebo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the slightly open window, Ari&#39;s soft voice reached him-clear, uncertain, but sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told Brandon you didn&#39;t like him anymore and asked him to stop making you sad,&#34; she said in a small voice.&#34;I also told him not to visit me again... that he&#39;s not my father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at Millie timidly, she asked, &#34;Millie, are you angry with me for saying that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave her a warm smile and pinched her cheek.&#34;Of course not. Why would I be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held Ari&#39;s small hands in hers. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. Want me to make beef stew for dinner? I just found a new recipe online and clearly you can plate the food creatively to shape cute little animals. Sound good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,please!&#34; Ari beamed. She always looked forward to Millie&#39;s cooking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With their dinner plan settled, they walked back to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,they were on the road, heading home together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should we tail them, sir?&#34; Eugene asked from the front seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon slowly shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t even sure why he had come. Maybe just to see Millie again, even if only from afar. But he was painfully aware that she didn&#39;t want to see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari&#39;s words hung in the silence, leaving a dull ache in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie hadn&#39;t refuted them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then there was the stew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t made it for him in so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, no matter how late he came home, she&#39;d be waiting, always with a warm meal ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d always given him a sense of comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon shut his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like those memories belonged to another life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much longer until the divorce would be finalized?&#34;he asked quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene didn&#39;t need to think. &#34;Today makes twenty-eight days, sir. In two more, the decree can be finalized.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon said nothing. Eugene glanced at him in the rearview mirror, and then asked cautiously, &#34;Are you...reconsidering things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s eyes opened. He met Eugene&#39;s reflection without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look was enough. Eugene quickly shifted his eyes forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My apologies, sir. I shouldn&#39;t have asked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon let the comment go without reproach,returning his attention to the view outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The street near the kindergarten was full of movement-parents greeting their children with wide smiles and open arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched them, something stirring quietly inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long have you been working with me now,Eugene?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since you took over the company at twenty-two.That makes six years,&#34; Eugene responded immediately</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Six years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Millie... she&#39;d been by his side for seven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seven long years. Thousands of days. Countless nights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon rested his head slightly against the window,expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s head to that beef stew place you mentioned before,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir.&#34; Eugene turned the key and drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Millie&#39;s car pulled into the neighborhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the rearview mirror, she watched Ari deep in concentration, carefully piecing together a puzzle.A small smile touched her lips. That quiet, content moment was all she needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Ari still called her &#34;Millie&#34; now, she believed that,someday, the girl would feel ready to say &#34;Mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, the girl only called her &#34;Miss Bennett&#34; at first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought warmed her, but it also reminded her-she needed to make things clear to Brandon again.He had no right to involve himself with Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That child was hers and hers alone-he had no place in her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After bringing Ari home, Millie prepared a warm,hearty dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kitchen filled with laughter as they cooked together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across town, Brandon had visited nearly every top-rated restaurant in Crobert, sampling their beef stew one by one. Yet, none of them tasted the way he remembered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at the bowl in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was something wrong with his taste buds?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Food shouldn&#39;t vary that much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even made by different hands, the ingredients were similar and the flavor should be close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Brandon lowered his spoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something wasn&#39;t right with him these days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was time to see a therapist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The days crept by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The 28th day since they filed the divorce slipped past quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the 29th came and went-ordinary, filled with errands and tasks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Millie returned home from the practice room,drained from a long rehearsal session.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a shower, changed into her pajamas, and glanced at the clock. It was just after midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The 30th day had begun. In less than twenty-four hours, her marriage to Brandon would be officially over.</p>
