                <p>Eventually, Vivian stepped in front of MAillie again, blocking her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help me straighten things out,&#34; Vivian said in the staff hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie couldn&#39;t help but find the whole thing ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, Vivian still carried herself like she was owed something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was no way Millie would lower herself to stand up for someone like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, she turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think about it! The odds aren&#39;t with me right now, but I know how to make a comeback!&#34; Vivian shouted after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t stop there. &#34;Once word gets out about your miscarriage, do you really think you can keep playing high and mighty? You&#39;re only doing good now because I&#39;ve had mercy on you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie almost laughed out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was talking about mercy now? Really?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She honestly had no idea where Vivian found the nerve to speak with such confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Serena!&#34; Vivian called after her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t bother looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think you can cruise your way to the top on this show? Just wait, I&#39;ll be right here when you come crawling back!&#34; Vivian yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, Millie packed her things and got ready to head out. Charles had set up a celebration dinner,and she was going to pick up Ari first. But before she could leave, Vivian created a huge scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the audience was calmly filing out, a man suddenly stormed into the recording studio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This man was the same person who had tried multiple times so far to question Vivian about the demo,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>only to be held back every single time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was the one who had let him in now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie learned this from her assistant, Barbara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He tried getting in several times,&#34; Barbara muttered beside her. &#34;Mr. Evans noticed too. I later heard he was looking for Vivian, but she had people keep him out. They say he&#39;s some obsessedfan of hers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie arched a brow. She paused her packing, wondering what kind of stunt Vivian was pulling now.Then she saw the man charge toward the stage,brimming with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The live stream equipment hadn&#39;t been fully turned off yet, so the audience watching online could still see everything unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was still on her seat, casually packing up her things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the man&#39;s voice rang out.&#34;Vivian!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mic was still live, so his shout echoed through the entire venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audience, who had been making their way out, turned around in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even those watching the stream were drawn back by the sudden commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff who was moments from ending the stream, froze in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want something?&#34; Vivian looked startled for a second, but then quickly composed herself and smiled at the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man lit up with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m your fan!&#34; he yelled, wiping the sweat off his brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon noticed what was going on and began to walk over, but Vivian&#39;s assistant quickly moved in front of him, shaking her head subtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped, frowning, unsure what was really going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I see. Nice to meet you,&#34; Vivian said warmly, reaching out her hand. &#34;Thank you for being a supporter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the casual observer, it all looked like a spontaneous encounter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, a number of people in the audience started feeling concerned for Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to overly obsessed fans, anything could happen. There had already been plenty of similar situations with other celebrities before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to be scared. I&#39;m not here to cause trouble!&#34; the man shouted. &#34;I just wanted to let you know that I&#39;ll always be cheering youon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian gave a polite smile, tilting her head as if genuinely confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw your studio demo of Glimnmer of Love online. It was amazing! I&#39;m honestly blown away by how talented you are!&#34; he went on, his voice rising with emotion. &#34;There&#39;s so much rumor about you today,Vivian, but l just want you to know that you&#39;re not any less than anyone else!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he added, &#34;Serena is a trained singer. Who knows how many years she&#39;s spent honing her voice?But you? You&#39;re just a regular person, and still, you can sing like a pro! Honestly, I think the demo of Glimmer of Love sounds just as good as the live performance of Yesterday!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian looked slightly embarrassed as she said, &#34;Thank you for your support, really... That&#39;s very generous of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not making this up!&#34; the man insisted. Then, without missing a beat, he asked what he&#39;d really come for. &#34;So, did you actually sing the demo for Glimmer of Love yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian looked as if she had no choice but to go along with it. She nodded. &#34;I did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up until now, she had always danced around the question, but this time, her answer was clear and direct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though many fans online had already assumed she was the voice behind the demo, there was a big difference between speculation and a public confirmation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man lit up even more. &#34;I just thought of something! Didn&#39;t you say earlier that you&#39;d be working with a film company to produce a mini-series for Glimmer of Love? You should totally include this demo in it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right, I&#39;ll think about it,&#34; Vivian responded with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the man continued talking excitedly, Millie looked completely in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was what Vivian&#39;s biting comments had been about, her claim that Millie had no chance of taking first place? She planned to pit the demo version of Glimmer of Love against Yesterday?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that demo version was recorded by Millie back when she wrote that song.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make a sale, she had to let people hear how it sounded. So she just did a quick demo, playing and singing it herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was recorded in some random studio at Evans Entertainment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s eyes turned toward Brandon. She noticed him staring at Vivian with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon was feeling mixed emotions at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Vivian&#39;s assistant stopped him earlier, Brandon had started to piece things together. This whole encounter had been staged by Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He and Vivian knew the truth. Vivian&#39;s song was bought from another artist from Evans Entertainment -Eva, and it was Eva who had recorded the original demo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So what was Vivian trying to do now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon had never paid much attention to online chatter. Even if he wanted to, he simply didn&#39;t have the time. His schedule was packed, and rumors about him popped up constantly. He didn&#39;t spend his days glued to a phone screen. That was what the PR team was for. His secretary, Eugene, only informed him when something truly needed his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So at this moment, he had no clue what kind of games Vivian had been playing lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time though, Brandon realized that Vivian wasn&#39;t quite the person he had believed her to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pondering on this, he pressed his lips together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was now waiting for Vivian to come forward and explain everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie noticed the change in Brandon&#39;s demeanor but chose not to say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Barbara&#39;s view of Vivian had also changed completely. &#34;I used to think she was pretty decent, and talented too. But now, it looks like she really is-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear that Vivian&#39;s move was designed to crush the competition and secure the top spot in the first round.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara shook her head, at a loss for words. To her, the whole thing felt cold and calculated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Charles walked over and gently draped a coat over Millie&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught part of Barbara&#39;s comment and gave a faint smile. &#34;We insiders know the truth, but the people online have no clue. As we speak, they&#39;re still praising her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara was stunned. She quickly pulled out her phone to check and sure enough, he was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Internet was flooded with admiration for Vivian&#39;s grace under pressure. Even when a superfan had rushed the stage, she&#39;d simply smiled and shaken his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, her supporters were all over the demo of Glimmer of Love, holding it up in comparison to Yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many online were now saying Vivian&#39;s &#34;less-than-perfect&#34; performance during the earlier live show had only been due to illness, and that Glimmer of Love was every bit as good as Yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t respond to any of it. She just walked out with Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Brandon and Vivian also left the venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the Bentley, Brandon cast a glance at Vivian as she scrolled through her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,his voice broke the silence. &#34;What&#39;s going on with the demo?&#34;</p>
