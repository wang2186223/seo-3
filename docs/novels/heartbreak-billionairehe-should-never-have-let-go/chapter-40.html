                <p>Vivian&#39;s brow knitted as she read through the document; then she checked a few online sites before letting out a light laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing to worry about,&#34; she said,resuming her search through the rack of dresses. &#34;They&#39;re just trying to see how I&#39;ll respond.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her caregiver looked at her, completely lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, Vivian kept her thoughts to herself,but this time she explained a bit further. &#34;If they were really serious about suing me, they would have made the legal notice public instead of sending it privately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still don&#39;t understand,&#34; the caregiver admitted.shaking her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s tone was patient. &#34;They&#39;re fishing for my reaction. If I start panicking like you do, they&#39;ll pounce and demand a sky-high settlement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver&#39;s confusion did not fade. &#34;So what are you going to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian just shrugged and pulled a dress from the closet, still smiling. &#34;Nothing. I&#39;m going to ignore them for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Charles won&#39;t dare to push me. It&#39;s not just because of my connection to Brandon, but also because everyone sees me as a poor, doomed soul.&#34; Vivian arranged her face into a sorrowful look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian tossed the dress toward her caregiver and said,&#34;Iron this before you head to bed.&#34; She turned away,her voice calm but firm. &#34;If Charles has any sense,he&#39;ll keep his mouth shut. The last thing he needs is to get his brothers riled up and ready to rip him apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time slipped away quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone knew it, night had returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Early that morning, Charles had already arrived to collect Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia frowned, insisting Millie needed more time to recover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, it was Giffard who talked her into letting Millie go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Millie and Charles had left, Alexia turned to her brother in disbelief. &#34;Giffard, you&#39;re really just letting Charles take her?&#34; Giffard nodded without hesitation. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But she...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexia, let&#39;s drop it for now. Pushing too hard could sometimes only make things worse,&#34;he retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Alexia still had more on her mind, she just gave a reluctant nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could not deny that, all these years, Millie&#39;s heart had always belonged to Brandon, never seeing Giffard as anything more than a friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to linger on the subject, Giffard quickly changed the topic. &#34;Did you manage to get the video yesterday?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I did. But there&#39;s a bit of a complication,&#34; Alexia admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tia managed to sneak her phone out. She swapped out the phone for a new one she bought and left the original case on before any confidentiality contract could be signed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That way, even if everyone signed the agreement later, any leak would have technically happened beforehand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Alexia wondered how Tia had pulled it off, since all the phones had been confiscated. But it turned out those devices were simply stored in a drawer in the office, and people were coming and going all the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later on, she realized no one seemed too worried about theft because the phones had all been wiped clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With so many IT experts able to recover data these days, it really came down to how thorough the company was about erasing it-and whether the specialist Alexia would find could restore anything useful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia went ahead and asked Tia for the device.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tia handed it over without hesitation, thinking that in a crowd that size during the live show, sneaking out a phone was not exactly impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, nobody had signed any nondisclosure agreements before theswap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If questioned, Tia could just say she was unaware of any problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, and Giffard, do you happen to know a good IT expert? I could use a recommendation,&#34; Alexia asked her brother after explaining everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I actually do. I&#39;ll reach out and see who&#39;s available,&#34; Giffard answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia gave a grateful nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, a sense of guilt seemed to follow her everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though it happened by accident, Millie&#39;s miscarriage was the result of her altercation with Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never once did Millie hold her responsible. She never expressed a desire to keep the child, and she even went out of her way to reassure Alexia, insisting it was fate and not her doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Alexia saw through it, knowing Millie was just trying to ease her burden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It reminded her of how, years ago, Millie had suggested they get matching tattoos to celebrate their survival after the motorbike accident that left her ugly scars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night settled across the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside a grand villa perched on Crobert&#39;s hillside,streams of high-end cars glided up the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People arrived in waves. Clusters of reporters and photographers staked out positions at the foot of the hill, their cameras ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Very few journalists were officially allowed in,but tonight&#39;s affair had drawn Crobert&#39;s most influential people, turning the event into a prime target for the paparazzi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any juicy scoop from the evening could be worth a small fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, from the winding road up to the sprawling villa parking lot, the area teemed with onlookers and flashing cameras.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luxury vehicles rolled in one after another, and for a moment, the night sky lit up with the bursts of camera lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one of the Ferraris, Millie and Charles made their way up the hill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This evening&#39;s charity gala, held to raise funds for children in need, called for more understated style.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had chosen a simple yet graceful silver satin dress that hugged her figure with quiet elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mask still hid her face-not the same as the one she wore during the last live show, but a silver-and-white half-mask that matched her dress and left her lips</p>
                
                
                
                <p>free for tasting wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting quietly in the passenger seat, Millie glanced at Charles while the car climbed higher, the moonlight shimmering over her and giving her an almost otherworldly appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the Evans Group was hosting the event,when Charles&#39; Ferrari pulled up in front of the villa,all eyes went straight to him and the mysterious, masked woman at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Serena?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that Serena? The woman behind the mask!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Evans, what&#39;s going on between you and Serena?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Evans, are you officially declaring a relationship with Serena tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reporters and paparazzi crowded in, microphones pushed as close as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, the event&#39;s security staff acted quickly,stepping in to bring the situation under control once the crowd grew rowdy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles chose not to answer right away. He stepped out first, and then moved around to open Millie&#39;s door and offer his hand, a move that sent camera flashes exploding across the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The questions continued to fly as Charles helped Millie to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him a small,reassuring nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to face the press, Charles remarked, &#34;Yes, this lady with me is Miss Serena Ellsworth, an artist represented by Evans Entertainment. She&#39;s simply accompanying me at the charity gala. That&#39;s all there is to it. Please avoid reading too much into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given Serena&#39;s contract to Evans Entertainment and with the ongoing promotion for Heavenly Melody, it made sense for her to be visible at major events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With online voting for the show&#39;s contestants just around the corner, raising her profile was important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the reporters were hungry for a headline-something more dramatic, something like an official announcement that Serena was now Charles&#39;girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They pushed in even closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles had just begun to show signs of irritation when someone&#39;s voice rang out sharp and loud, cutting through the moment. &#34;Oh my God, is that really happening? Isn&#39;t that Brandon&#39;s car pulling in? Brandon,the one who has only shown up to three social functions in the last seven years, is actually here tonight?!&#34;</p>
