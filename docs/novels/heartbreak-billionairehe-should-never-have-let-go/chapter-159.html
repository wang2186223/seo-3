                <p>Vivian pressed her lips together and wiped her cheeks, though the redness in her eyes remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never lied to anyone,&#34; she said quietly. &#34;I wasn&#39;t a home-wrecker, and I&#39;m not trying to paint myself as a victim. I just... honestly didn&#39;t know Serena and Millie were the same person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tears came again. She tried to stop them, but they kept flowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I joined this show to inspire those battling illness. That&#39;s it. You may think I wronged her, but I didn&#39;t understand the situation. I was clueless. I didn&#39;t even know she was in the competition. I had no idea Millie was the one bidding against me for the tanzanite at the auction. And I certainly didn&#39;t know that gem was hers-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud splatter cut her off as a water balloon hit the ground near her feet, bursting and soaking her shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just answer us! Did you or didn&#39;t you wreck someone&#39;s marriage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos erupted instantly. Shouts rang out from every direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, many had believed Vivian-believed she&#39;d spoken up for the sick, believed she wasn&#39;t the other woman in Brandon and Millie&#39;s marriage. She had their sympathy. Their support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now the truth was unraveling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie, Brandon&#39;s legal wife, had joined the show in disguise. She&#39;d been under fire the entire time,while Brandon was seen frequently with Vivian, fueling endless speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online posts had smeared Millie&#39;s name since day one. And it was likely Vivian had a hand in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People who once stood behind Vivian, who had mocked Millie in her defense, now realized they&#39;d been manipulated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They wanted answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did not!&#34; Vivian shouted, her voice cracking. &#34;Believe me or not, I didn&#39;t do it! If you despise me that much, then fine! I&#39;ll never speak anything online again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the crowd wasn&#39;t listening. They were too riled up to care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Vivian dropped to the ground in a feigned faint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The uproar only worsened, forcing the Heavenly Melody crew to send security to take control of the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was swiftly taken back to her SUV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the door shut and the others walked off, she snapped her eyes open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething,she shoved everything off the seat beside her in one violent sweep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That witch Millie!&#34; she snarled, her voice thick with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone buzzed. Johnny again. Gritting her teeth, Vivian forced herself to breathe evenly before picking up the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after Heavenly Melody wrapped up, the noise refused to die down. In fact, the buzz grew louder online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interviews with contestants after the finals circulated everywhere, many centered on the dramatic finale-Vivian fainting mid-chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some participants even jumped on livestreams, eager to ride the wave of attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But most of the spotlight had shifted. All eyes were now on Serena&#39;s performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Countless influencers dissected her every gesture, lyric, and expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her stage presence was unreal. No one&#39;s going to top that for years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the live broadcast, no one had realized Serena and Millie were the same person. Most viewers were still too caught up in the protests to notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, watching the performance again with fresh eyes, it felt completely transformed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her song wasn&#39;t just a performance, it was a reflection of how the public viewed her, shifting in real time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had accurately anticipated each action and response, even the way the Internet would react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she rose through it, crafting a new identity right under the Internet&#39;s watchful gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reproducing something like that? Impossible. It wasn&#39;t just good. Itwas unforgettable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that we know Serena is Millie, let&#39;s walk through her five songs again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;&#39;Yesterday,&#39; &#39;Us,&#39; &#39;Deep Sea,&#39; &#39;Journey,&#39; and &#39;Sculpture.&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Each one hit so hard. I used to wonder what she must have been through to write songs like that. Now I get it.She is Millie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Imagine standing on that stage, pouring your heart out, while Vivian judged you and Brandon sat in the crowd...for Vivian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From every note,you can tell she loved him. You can hear the pain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop. I&#39;m getting emotional...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve had enough. I&#39;m going to drag Vivian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across social platforms, influencers, fans, and onlookers lit up the Internet with reactions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville, now representing Evans Entertainment, stepped in to clear the air regarding Millie&#39;s identity,but made no move to fan the flames against Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, some netizens, feeling manipulated and embarrassed, headed straight to Vivian&#39;s page to stir up trouble on their own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was probably the backlash Vivian never expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more carefully built the image, the harder it shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the drama unfolded online, Millie and her friends were busy enjoying their victory banquet.Vivian wasn&#39;t even a passing thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This time, we booked a private room. No chance of Brandon crashing it again!&#34; Charles announced proudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t forgotten the last time they&#39;d tried to toast Millie&#39;s singlehood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight,though, the mood was light. Spirits were high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To your win!&#34; Charles raised his glass first, his expression full of admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that she was officially done with Brandon, maybe his window had finally opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d even been working on keeping his temper in check lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Charles didn&#39;t rush. He glanced at Millie&#39;s smiling face, and then looked away. If things didn&#39;t work out,he didn&#39;t want to lose her as a friend either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations, Millie!&#34; the others joined in, raising their glasses with genuine warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had changed out of her stage clothes and removed all her makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small smile, she lifted her glass and emptied it in one go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This past month has been the hardest period of my lishe said, her eyes welling up with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she wasn&#39;t one for dramatic speeches, her emotion was real at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m thankful to every single one of you, for sticking by me, for lifting me up when I couldn&#39;t do it myself.</p>
