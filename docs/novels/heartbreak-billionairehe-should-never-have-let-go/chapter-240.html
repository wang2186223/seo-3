                <p>A quick glance from Millie revealed the drones shifting into position, slowly shaping themselves into a massive ring in the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath that glowing loop, more drones flickered to life, sketching the delicate outline of a woman&#39;s smiling profile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fireworks burst to life, their flames unfurling from the outer edge of the ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They came in brilliant shades of white and blue,flaring like shimmering tassels across the dark canvas above. Wisps of smoke drifted over the woman&#39;s image, giving her the illusion of a gauzy veil -mysterious, breathtaking, and alive with light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of sound followed as streaks of color shot up from the ground, exploding in dazzling blooms that framed the veiled face in the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From every corner of the city, more fireworks joined the spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each sharp boom echoed across Crobert, rolling over rooftops and streets alike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Against the night, the skyline was awash with color,and the drones kept climbing, painting intricate,shifting designs that felt both futuristic and otherworldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never before had Crobert witnessed such a show.Not even the fireworks from Brandon and Millie&#39;s wedding could compare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire horizon shimmered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From sidewalks to balconies, people tilted their heads toward the sky, murmuring in awe, their phones raised to capture the magic before it faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farther away, Charles steered his car down the road,catching glimpses of the spectacle in his windshield before glancing toward the rooftop garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden vibration in his pocket pulled him from</p>
                
                
                
                <p>view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Interested in discussing a collaboration?&#34; the message read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon&#39;s name flashed on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles hesitated, his fingers still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another message appeared. &#34;My brother wanted me to reach out. You have nothing to worry about-our families have plenty in common, and we&#39;d work well together. Among your brothers, you have our full support.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, wry smile touched Charles&#39; lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was Myron&#39;s plan to keep him quiet? To stop him from ever telling Millie how he felt?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was really unnecessary, though. For Charles Millie&#39;s happiness mattered more than anything-and he&#39;d do whatever it took&lt; to protect it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of discussing a partnership didn&#39;t seemn half bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning down a solid business opportunity would be pure foolishness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that in mind, Charles typed a reply to Jayceon before steering his car into a U-turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the car carrying Alexia and Giffard eased away from its spot and rolled onto the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Giffard at the wheel, the glow of the traffic light ahead shifted to red, forcing the car to slow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the passenger seat, Alexia&#39;s gaze drifted between the fireworks bursting above and the man beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Giffard,&#34; Alexia said softly,a trace of worry in her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; he answered without glancing over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long breath escaped her before she finally voiced her thoughts. &#34;It looks like Millie and Myron are serious now. You...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be in Flaville next weekend for the seminar.&#34; His</p>
                
                
                
                <p>voice cut in, ending her sentence before it coud finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted again, but no convincing words came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax.&#34; Giffard kept his attention fixed on the glowing night sky ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This trip has been on my calendar for a while. It&#39;s not changing. And about Millie-I&#39;ll take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All Alexia could do was shake her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>이 know exactly what you&#39;re trying to say.&#34; The light turned green, and the car moved forward. &#34;But even if it&#39;s just because v/e grew up together and she&#39;s always treated me like family, I still have to do this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he dealt with things, Millie&#39;s happiness-and whoever she chose to share it with-would be entirely her own decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Alexia gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still watching the glittering display above, she asked,&#34;Will you still cook for her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie might have thought their household had hired a new chef,but the truth was, Giffard had been the one who cooked her those dishes all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re overthinking, silly girl.&#34; Giffard&#39;s chuckle was warm. &#34;Even if things between her and me don&#39;t work out, it&#39;s not like we will stop being friends. I&#39;m not that childish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Alexia finally let out the breath she&#39;d been holding, though a touch of embarrassment lingered on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Giffard reached over to ruffle her hair before returning his focus to the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Above them, the sky kept bursting into color. Inside a suite at the international hotel, Egbert cradled a glass of red wine, the amber light glinting off a small wooden fox sculpture resting on the table nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, he had caught the live broadcast and learned that Millie had accepted Myron&#39;s proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, helpless smile touched his lips at the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a little late in coming back, and I&#39;ve already missed everything,&#34; he murmured to himself. &#34;Millie...are you certain this is the right choice? Is he really the one for you? And me... who will be the one for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, on the rooftop garden, the night unfolded in dazzling color. In Millie&#39;s eyes, the reflection of drones and fireworks shimmered, rising and falling over the cityscape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze followed the veil-like bursts that drifted over the woman&#39;s profile in the sky, the glowing blooms in the distance, and the ring brought forth by the great whale display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came a sight that made her breath hitch-her own name spelled out against the vast night sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that... me?&#34; Millie&#39;s voice was barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron gave a slow nod, his hand reaching for hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As I&#39;ve always wanted,&#34; he said. &#34;Millie, I want to take away everything that man ever did to hurt you.Every scar he left-I&#39;ll heal it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers closed firmly around hers, holding on with a strength that left no room for doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From this night forward, whenever you see fireworks or a ring, let it remind you of this moment. And when you think of the one you love, know that it&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, there was something fiercely possessive in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie tore her gaze away from the fireworks and focused on him instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In those slightly reddened eyes, her own reflection shimmered back at her from the depths of his pupils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small flutter stirred in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories returned of the day he had taken her to that chamber, showing her all the paintings as if</p>
                
                
                
                <p>revealing a piece of his soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had loved her for so many years, and his patience had matched that devotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat welled in her eyes, and she let a soft smile form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; she said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s own lips curved, though his eyes glistened.He drew her closer, unable to look at anything but her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After swallowing the lump in his throat, he cupped her head and pressed his lips to hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not a gentle kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It came with an urgency that stole her breath, his arms locking around her as though he meant to fuse her into himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overhead, the fireworks roared and scattered in brilliant bursts, but Millie no longer knew where she V/as.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only things she felt were the heat of his body</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and the searing warmth of his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Far below, in the street, Brandon sat behind the wheel of his car, looking up at the night sky-and at the couple locked in that kiss. Every fiber in him wanted to break them apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s voice echoed in his mind, holding him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The promise he had made kept him in place, hoping she would never speak of the past again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip on the steering wheel tightened until his knuckles blanched, the ache in his chest nearly unbearable. Pulling out his phone, he opened Millie&#39;s chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll hand over the Bennett family&#39;s assets without question. I&#39;ll uncover the truth about your father&#39;s death. I&#39;ll treat you right, Millie. Don&#39;t choose him,don&#39;t get engaged to him. Please...wait for me.&#34;</p>
