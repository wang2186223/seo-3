                <p>A policewoman gently knocked on the window, her eyes full of concern as she looked at Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gripped her stomach, feeling sweat break out across her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am, are you alright?&#34; asked the officer, anxiety clear in her voice as she beckoned the bystanders to come and help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie realized the pain had something to do with the baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The symptoms were unmistakably those of a miscarriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, she had jumped and sprinted away from a car speeding through the parkinglot, only to be struck afterward by the same black vehicle while she was in her own car.Could her baby really be slipping away from her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had indeed decided to terminate the pregnancy,but...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic and sorrow flooded her mind without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of losing her child suddenly terrified Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am, please answer me. Open your door!&#34; the policewoman screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s eyes clouded over, and though the pain was sharp and unrelenting, she still managed to push the car door open just before everything went black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, lights flooded every floor of the Watson Group building, casting a glow that reached out into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon reviewed a proposal, exhausted from attending endless meetings throughout the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to make several crucial decisions before theday ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been working non-stop since the afternoon,his expression growing increasingly stern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in the expansive conference room sat silently, unwilling to draw his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon lightly tapped the table with his left hand as he studied the report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s responsible for this project?&#34; Brandon&#39;s tone was calm, yet his authority made everyone uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s me, Mr. Watson,&#34; answered a middle-aged man,standing up nervously as he wiped sweat from his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon glanced at him, lips parting slightly as he instructed coldly, &#34;Explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The middle-aged man wiped his forehead again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, it&#39;s... uh...&#34; he stammered, failing to give a clear explanation and rambling through various excuses.He knew deep down he had botched the project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough,&#34; Brandon interjected,cutting him short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear filled the man&#39;s eyes as he started trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson, please give me another chance,&#34; he begged. &#34;I promise P&#39;ll fix it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon frowned, prompting his secretary, Eugene Barnes, to step forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you proposed the project, you made grand promises,&#34; Eugene said firmly. &#34;Now, who&#39;s responsible for this mess?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just-&#34; The man, well into middle age, began to speak again, hoping to make himself understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No more excuses,&#34; Eugene chimed in harshly. &#34;The Watson Group fully backed this project, yet despite all the resources, you failed miserably. You do know why,don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man opened his mouth to argue, but Brandon threw a document down in front of him.&#34;Corruption in such a small project is outrageous,&#34;Brandon remarked sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The middle-aged man turned pale as he read the document.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to respond, his body trembling, but Eugene gave a signal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doors swung open, and the company&#39;s internal.inspection team entered,escorting him&#39;out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson, I&#39;m sorry. Please forgive me!&#34; The middle-aged man&#39;s desperate voice faded into silence as he was led away,leaving the room eerily quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon cast a cold glance around the room, making sure everyone understood the consequences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meeting adjourned,&#34; Brandon announced, standing and walking swiftly from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene accompanied Brandon back to the CEO&#39;s office.Noticing Brandon sink into the executive chair and rub his forehead tiredly, Eugene instructed an assistant to bring coffee immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon massaged his temples, briefly closing his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhaustion weighed heavily on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew perfection was unattainable, especially.within a massive corporation like Watson Group,where internal problems naturally arose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood that clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But recently, he couldn&#39;t pinpoint why the fatigue felt deeper than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He heard footsteps approaching, followed by a gentle sound of a cup touching the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, drink some water. You&#39;ve been working too late lately, and you need to take care of yourself.I&#39;ve added that special essence you like.&#34; Oddly enough, the voice seemed familiar to Brandon.When Brandon opened his eyes, however, he saw Eugene standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking down, he found only a steaming cup of coffee on the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint tension pulled at Brandon&#39;s lips as he pressed them together in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson, do you not want coffee?&#34; Eugene asked,noticing Brandon&#39;s mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s brow creased slightly, unsure about his own complicated feelngs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s normally Mrs. Watson who gets your water ready,&#34; said Eugene, his voice apologetic. &#34;couldn&#39;t find whatever essence she adds, and you looked exhausted, so I just went ahead and brought you coffee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, it had always been Millie beside him while he was working late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon closed his eyes again, feeling his headache grow stronger.&#34;Should I give Mrs. Watson a call and check with her?&#34; Eugene asked carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That won&#39;t be necessary,&#34; Brandon answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene gave a small nod, and the office slipped back into stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quiet that followed felt strange, almost unnatural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon couldn&#39;t remember the space ever feeling this hushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence began to grate on him, stirring a wave of frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly is happening this month?&#34; he asked,cutting through the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you mean in terms of work, Mr. Watson?&#34;Eugene asked in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, back then, Mrs. Watson usually took care of smaller problems first, like what happened today withthe manager. You only got involved when something really needed your attention, so...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon opened his eyes and cast a look in Eugene&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the unspoken message, Eugene shifted uncomfortably and said, &#34;Mr. Watson, I take full responsibility. I should have handled it better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t come down hard on him. He simply gave a slight shake of his head. &#34;Where&#39;s the contract for the new partnership?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene lowered his gaze even more. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Mr.Watson. The team hasn&#39;t sorted it out yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon let out a slow sigh and motioned for him to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene, clearly relieved, turned and left the room without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brandon stared at the shut office door, he couldn&#39;t ignore the truth. He had ended things with Millie so suddenly that many of the responsibilities</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she used to manage had fallen through the cracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The office sat in a hush, broken only by the soft ticking of the clock on the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp scent of coffee lingered in the air, its bitterness cutting through the stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steam curled up from the mug on his desk, and with it, Brandon&#39;s frown grew more pronounced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for his phone and read over the message he had sent Millie, where he asked her to come back with him to visit his grandparents on the weekend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was still no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could clearly recall the way she had firmly turned him down over the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she still holding onto that anger?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his eyes stayed fixed on the screen, a sudden knock at the door broke his focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced up and saw Vivian standing in the doorway with a bright smile.&#34;Brandon,&#34; Vivian said as she walked in, her voice light. &#34;I thought I&#39;d drop by and keep you company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon slid his phone out of sight and gave her a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s eyes drifted toward Brandon&#39;s phone, but her face remained unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, she sat down slowly, her movements uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon caught the shift in her demeanor and asked,&#34;Is something bothering you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, did Millie get in touch with you today?&#34;Vivian asked, her voice measured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to her, arching his brows to urge her to go on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This afternoon, I posted a short video about joining Heavenly Melody. I only meant to follow the same path she once walked. I didn&#39;t expect the backlash online..&#34; Vivian explained, watching his face for any hint of reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, and then asked carefully, &#34;Did she say anything to you about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s brow tightened. This afternoon? He had spent the entire day locked in meetings and hadn&#39;t kept up with anything online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glance at the clock told him it was already fifteen minutes past nine in the evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s something else I need to mention...&#34; Vivian hesitated before adding, &#34;When I left the studio at a quarter to nine, something felt off. It wasn&#39;t until l parked downstairs just now that I realized I&#39;d been followed by paparazzi the entire way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked genuinely regretful as she pulled out her phone and handed it to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the screen were a series of photos, showing her from the doors of Vivian Floral Design all the way to the Watson Group building. The headline above the images read, &#34;Vivian spotted entering Watson Group late at night-rumored to be meeting Brandon.&#34;Just beneath the photos, the comment section was already buzzing with harsh remarks, many of them ridiculing Millie and speculating about her divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, I&#39;m really sorry. I should have been more careful,&#34; said Vivian, her voice shaking slightly as her eyes began to well up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave a casual wave of his hand, brushing it off as nothing worth worrying about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already made up his mind to make things official with Vivian once his divorce case was finalized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then there was Millie...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the thought crossed his mind, his phone buzzed against the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clock had just struck twenty minutes past nine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for his phone, and there it was-Millie&#39;s name lit up on the screen.</p>
