                <p>Millie had already regained her balance and let go of Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By then, their yachts had pulled in, and the dock workers quickly came over to help unload their catch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy, easy! No need to rush!&#34; Alexia shouted with excitement. &#34;Let&#39;s count everything first. We need to know which team got the bigger haul!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Myron&#39;s help, Millie stepped off the yacht.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up again, searching the shore, but Brandon,who had just been watching them, was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, it felt like she&#39;d imagined the whole thing,causing her to frown in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her baffled state, Myron&#39;s voice came from beside her. &#34;You weren&#39;t mistaken. It really was him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie glanced at Myron, who responded with a soft,reassuring smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure why he just looked over and left,&#34;Myron added with a thoughtful expression in his eyes. &#34;Maybe something finally clicked for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave a thoughtful nod, and then said, &#34;Let&#39;s not overthink it. We&#39;re here to have fun! Didn&#39;t you say a top chef&#39;s coming to cook for us tonight? We should enjoy a proper feast!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron nodded. &#34;Absolutely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They then shared a knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie reminded herself to eat well tonight. She&#39;d need the energy for tomorrow&#39;s product launch,which would be anything but easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had suggested to Myron earlier that they reschedule their weekly date, but he had insisted on keeping today&#39;s plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood why. He wanted her to unwind. And that was likely why he hadn&#39;t made it a private date.He had also invited her friends along for the fishing trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That gesture, more than anything,helped her relax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow!&#34; Alexia&#39;s voice rang out as she rushed over to where Millie and Myron were chatting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, that fish you caught was massive! How did you pull that off?&#34; Her eyes sparkled with genuine astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie chuckled, brushing off everything else on her mind.&#34;I almost ended up in the water.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron nodded beside her. &#34;It yanked on her line so hard, I nearly didn&#39;t catch her in time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter broke out among the group, lightening the mood as they relived the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, nearby, Brandon sat in his car with a cigarette burning between his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s voice echoed in his mind, &#34;If you truly love her,could you bear to see her hurt? If being with you only causes her pain... Wouldn&#39;t letting go be the kinder choice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rising smoke curled around him, casting a lonely air over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s smile popped up in his head. The radiant smile he had just seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t smiled like that around him for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it truly time to let her go?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t have the answer. And deep down, he didn&#39;t want one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cigarette butts lay scattered near his car door, while laughter and music drifted from the lively seaside villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the people shared a meal and played games.Through the French windows, he could see her dancing with Myron. And next to their moving figures sat the small outline of a child, watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked content.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s loud, out-of-tune singing resonated from afar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was wrapped in happiness. Everyone but Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, online forums were heating up with chatter about Elliott Group&#39;s upcoming product launch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Millie and Myron really go out sea fishing to celebrate the new product? That&#39;s gutsy! Already popping champagne? What if it all crashes tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right?! I heard from a source that this time, Millie is not just the spokesperson, she actually led the project. The entire marketing plan was her idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously? Does she even know anything about marketing? Wasn&#39;t she just Brandon&#39;s personal assistant for years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll see soon enough. If things flop, Vivian will have a field day laughing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The product launch had stirred interest from all directions, especially from Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed confident in her judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie barely accomplished anything while she was with the Watson Group. How could she suddenly shine now?&#34; Vivian said to her caregiver. &#34;I bet Myron is trying to impress her by handing her everything.Those designs and marketing strategies aren&#39;t even hers. Once I call her out on cheating, she&#39;ll be left with nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver nodded along, though she didn&#39;t quite understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Vivian wasn&#39;t willing to leave things to  chance. She reached out to Johnny, arranging a little &#34;surprise&#34; for Millie on launch day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Moonlit Estate, Derek and Norma scrolled through the online chatter, shaking their heads at the drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Millie really ends up with Myron, what will Brandon do?&#34; Derek asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He might lose his mind...&#34; Norma murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Back then... things almost turned out differently.&#34; He left it at that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let it be,&#34; Norma concluded. &#34;We&#39;ve done what we can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a hotel suite, Egbert swirled a glass of red wine in hand, scanning the online buzz with an amnused smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie... after all these years, you still have so many admirers. But of all people, why him?&#34; he murmured to himself. &#34;Someone that dangerous..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts drifted to the moments he&#39;d crossed paths with Myron. The man always seemed to play fair,yet somehow came out ahead. And he was often wearing that cheerful, unbothered smile that could drive anyone mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, I hope you succeed,&#34; Egbert said with a smile.&#34;Out of everyone, I trust you more. And, I feel... It&#39;s time to add a little spice for tomorrow and the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the seaside villa, Millie and Myron sat side by side on the cool sand, letting the breeze wash over them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you nervous about tomorrow&#39;s launch?&#34; Myron asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie took a slow sip of her drink, feeling the wind brush against her skin. &#34;I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t look nervous,&#34; Myron said with a chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie turned to him, raising her eyebrows. &#34;What about now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron didn&#39;t respond, and she gave a faint smile.&#34;This launch is my chance to win back what rightfully belongs to the Bennett family. Of course I&#39;m anxious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s gaze softened. He reached out and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, which was blowing across her face. &#34;There was a time, back at the Flesta border, when I crossed paths with someone completely reckless. My airline route was at risk, and I was on edge. But in the end, things worked out perfectly. That person was nothing like what l&#39;d heard about him. He had changed by then, and our partnership went surprisingly well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie laughed. &#34;You&#39;re talking about Egbert, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron nodded with a faint smile. &#34;You figured it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He added, his deep eyes fixed on Millie &#39;I also heard that it was you who changed him. If you could handle someone like him, then this launch is nothing in comparison. Everything has been double-checked,and the whole team believes in the plan. Just trust me, Millie. You will succeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie met his eyes, finding strength in the way he looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she nodded.</p>
