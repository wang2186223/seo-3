                <p>That day, Brandon and Millie had a vicious argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time it was over, her cheeks were wet with tears, while he felt nothing but annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wanting to put distance between them, he turned to walk out. But before he could leave, she called out after him, &#34;Brandon, after all these years, after everything we&#39;ve shared, is that truly what you think of me? That I&#39;d forge documents and lie just to frame someone else and get your attention?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed silent in that moment. Then, he just grabbed his jacket and headed for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet right as he reached the entrance, the sharp crash of breaking glass echoed from behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until later that the maids told the details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Watson&#39;s hands were trembling so much she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>dropped the glass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She felt nauseous and started vomiting, but the doctor said nothing serious was wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Watson, Mrs. Watson has been in low spirits and crying. Would you like to check on her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, he&#39;d written it off as nothing more than a ploy to make him soften.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s gaze locked on the bold letters stamped across the medical report-&#34;Psychosomatic Symptoms.&#34; The truth slammed into him, and he realized he&#39;d been completely wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth now stood exposed, knocking the wind out of him as though the room had been stripped of every last breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew all too well that after her father&#39;s death,Millie had gone from a pampered heiress to an ordinary woman. Even after her mother married Hayden, Hayden had treated Millie with relentless</p>
                
                
                
                <p>cruelty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Hayden ended up in prison, Millie&#39;s relationship with her mother only grew colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon had always knowvn Millie leaned on him for everything, her one source of love, her anchor, her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And still, he had betrayed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t begin to imagine what went through her heart the moment he walked away that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it felt like her entire world had crumbled beneath her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet back then, he hadn&#39;t seen it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, his attention was entirely consumed by looking after Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overhead, the corridor light buzzed and flickered,casting the space in an unsteady glow that made it feel unreal, as if he&#39;d stepped into a scene from a nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How Brandon wished it was a nightmare, one he could wake from to find her still there, with everything unbroken and time left to make it right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the sharp sting from his fingernails digging into his palm made it painfully clear this was no dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single image flashed in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the profile picture of the mysterious sender when Millie had shown him those provoking messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, he gave it only a passing glance,dismissing it because the profile wasn&#39;t Vivian&#39;s, and deciding Millie must have been lying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now the truth slammed into him-he&#39;d seen that profile before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been at the charity gala. When he returned to his seat, his eyes had drifted to Vivian&#39;s phone, and there it was... Vivian&#39;s alt account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon shot to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The abrupt movement sent a wave of nausea through him, his vision dimming for a split second, yet that image in his mind only became clearer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clarity hit him like a man gasping for breath after nearly drowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stormed into Vivian&#39;s hospital room, closing the distance between them in long, determined strides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that very moment, Vivian was in the middle of messaging Oakley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley was the one who had arranged her attending doctor, and now, feeling betrayed, she was furiously firing off texts demanding answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking Brandon had already left, she didn&#39;t even glance up when he walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Brandon, eyes blazing red with fury,pulled the phone from her hands that she reacted,lunging for it. &#34;Brandon,give me my phone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was using her alt account to talk to Oakley,and there was no way she could let Brandon see what</p>
                
                
                
                <p>was on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, she was meticulous, deleting her messages right after each exchange, but this time,the most recent ones were still sitting there since they were still in the middle of their conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian lunged forward and attempted to grab the phone,but Brandon pinned her in place with one firm hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked over the screen, catching her insults toward someone named &#34;Blade Joker,&#34; and let out a cold,humorless laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without pausing, he began scrolling through her contacts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing, Brandon!&#34; Vivian screamed.&#34;You can&#39;t go through my phone like that. That&#39;s an invasion of my privacy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon brushed her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,he found the contact he was looking for, Millie and opened the chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation thread held nothing but the automatic greeting message after the friend request was accepted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon understood instantly that the messages were gone because Vivian had erased them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Millie had shown him the chat logs, the timestamp on the greeting message matched this one perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when he&#39;d looked through Vivian&#39;s conversation with Blade Joker, the earlier exchanges were missing entirely. Still, from the tone and context of her recent messages, it was obvious this wasn&#39;t their first conversation, hinting that Vivian routinely deleted her messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing, Brandon?&#34; Vivian&#39;s voice pitched higher, her panic spilling over into a desperate shout meant to hide her unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Brandon pushed her back against the wall, his gaze blazing. &#34;Did you send messages to stir up trouble for Millie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I didn&#39;t!&#34; Vivian blurted automatically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve already seen the proof!&#34; Brandon shot back, his jaw tight. For the first time, he looked at her and felt nothing but disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was all her lies-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian!&#34; Brandon&#39;s voice cracked like a whip. &#34;Don&#39;t think wiping them locally makes them vanish. I can pull the cloud backups. I can recover every single file from your phone. So are you going to admit it now,or should | dig it all up myself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confronted with this version of Brandon, Vivian&#39;s bravado faltered completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knéw exactly how vicious her messages to Millie had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if Brandon uncovers them...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon seeing that Vivian refused to come clean,Brandon&#39;s expression hardened as he pulled out his phone and called Eugene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene wasted no time showing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t do this!&#34; Vivian screamed. &#34;It&#39;s my personal privacy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon let out a cold sneer. So now she thought throwing around privacy rights would intimidate him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson.&#34; Eugene greeted as he arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon extended the phone toward Eugene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll talk!&#34; Vivian broke down, her voice shaking through her sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way she could let Eugene get his hands on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she usually used a different device for things like this, this one still held plenty of dangerous secrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Watson Group had top-tier data recovery specialists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She preferred to reveal only what she chose, rather than risk Brandon taking her phone, digging through</p>
                
                
                
                <p>its data, and uncovering everything she&#39;d been hiding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down Vivian&#39;s face as she reached toward the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Brandon didn&#39;t block her and simply watched with a cold stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian unlocked a hidden folder, fingers trembling as she keyed in the password.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could open anything, Brandon snatched the phone right back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked to the folder name-&#34;Trophies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The implication couldn&#39;t have been clearer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon leveled Vivian with a stare so cold it felt like it could freeze the air between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian didn&#39;t dare meet his gaze; she kept her head bowed, her crying soft and pitiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the folder was a collection of images, neatly arranged by date.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious she had taken screenshots before erasing the messages every time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first read, &#34;You should know who l am. Do you like the flowers in your living room today? I sent them. He said they were beautiful.&#34;</p>
