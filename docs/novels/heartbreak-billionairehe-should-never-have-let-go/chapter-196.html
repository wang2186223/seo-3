                <p>Rita clutched the documents in her hands and gave a nod. Then, she and Brandon moved to a quiet corner of the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard you&#39;re a doctor here.&#34; Brandon spoke first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita nodded again in confirmation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly do you want to ask me?&#34; She looked at him. &#34;Or... what&#39;s been troubling you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stared at her for a moment. Finally, he said,&#34;I&#39;m confused about something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita gave another nod, signaling for him to go on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon&#39;s gaze didn&#39;t stay on her. He looked somewhere distant, his expression tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I love someone deeply, but I&#39;ve also hurt her badly...What should I do?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita looked at him, unsure if he was referring to Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What choices do you have now?&#34; she asked gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She wants to leave, but I don&#39;t want her to go.I want her to stay with me, so l used some... methods to keep her.&#34; His voice lowered. &#34;Shameful methods.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fell silent. Then, turning to her again, he asked, &#34;If it were you, what would you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita let out a long sigh. &#34;Loving someone doesn&#39;t mean chaining them to your side. If she wants to go,let her. If you truly love her, could you bear to see her hurt? If being with you only causes her pain...Wouldn&#39;t letting go be the kinder choice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stared at each other, the silence between them filled with unspoken emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the outside, it might have seemed like there was a clear answer. But Brandon wasn&#39;t ready to accept it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only now did he realize-it was never that Millie ---couldn&#39;t let go of him. it was ham who couldn&#39;t let go of Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she had already made her choice. She had chosen Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, he nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Brandon said, and then took the file folder and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat alone in his car, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, his temper had gotten the better of him.Things had spiraled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was time to make things right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a long breath, he pulled out his phone and called Eugene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson?&#34; Eugene answered quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Notify all relevant departments to draft a plan. We need to sever all connections between Vivian and Watson Group,&#34; Brandon said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; Eugene sounded confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any issue related to the recent stock fluctuation-and any of Vivian&#39;s future projects-must be kept completely separate from the Watson Group. No overlap, no mutual impact,&#34; Brandon said. His voice was steady again, like his old self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s project was too much of a gamble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had warned her, but she kept going. He couldn&#39;t stop her. So, he had to cut ties to save the Watson Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, set up a new back-up project for her. Make sure the funds are handled properly,&#34; Brandon added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was his final gesture of leniency toward Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Millie... He lowered his gaze, not daring to think too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hoped time would soften the edges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to start the engine, he spotted the doctor who had handled Vivian&#39;s diagnosis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like the right time to clear some doubts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stepped out of the car and walked over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor now had his back to him, chatting with someone over the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, we&#39;re only able to cover up this much. Even though it&#39;s a private facility, and we&#39;ve got more leeway, we still can&#39;t forge a full diagnosis without any symptoms. Last time, someone wanted a fake their medical record too, but they&#39;d actually slit their wrists-so that was easier to explain. If your-&#34; the doctor said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon hadn&#39;t meant to eavesdrop. But at the mention of wrist-slitting and fake medical records,he froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be Vivian?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then remembered the mailing issue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she changed the address on purpose-to stop him from getting the report?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word,Brandon turned and left. He called Eugene again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson?&#34; Eugene answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look into who Vivian has been spending time with recently. Also, investigate the psychiatrist who handled her case,&#34; Brandon said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; Eugene got to work immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon returned to the car, his brows furrowed as he stared at the document he had just received.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Vivian faking it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started the engine and drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time passed quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day, as Brandon was heading to Watson Group,a notification lit up on his phone. &#34;Breaking: Millie and Myron spotted getting cozy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photo showed them on a yacht, out at sea,fishing together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it wasn&#39;t your typical fishing trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were holding the same pole, pulling something up from the water. They stood close-too close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s phone buzzed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Darden. &#34;Hey buddy, did you see the news?Millie and Myron went sea fishing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stared at the message for a moment, and then replied, &#34;I saw it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden messaged again. &#34;But didn&#39;t you say she was busy with her adopted daughter? Why&#39;s she out there fishing with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got the address and drove straight there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie and Myron were returning with a cooler full of fish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d catch so many!&#34; Millie said, wide-eyed with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron had invited her on their second weekly date.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She almost turned it down. The new product launch was tomorrow, and Ari was still in the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And who went sea fishing on a date anyway?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been five days since Ari&#39;s surgery. Doctors suggested five to ten days of close medical observation, and Millie wanted her to stay a little longer just to make sure she was really fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; already thought of that,&#34; Myron had said with a smile when Millie voiced her concern. &#34;I&#39;ve got a beach house nearby. A doctor and a chef are already there. We&#39;ll take Ari along, and after fishing, we&#39;ll cook and eat together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even consulted Alexia and her brother, making sure Ari&#39;s health could handle such an outing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, it became a group outing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They split into teams and turned it into a competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia shouted in excitement with every catch, and with Giffard beside her, they also caught quite a lot.But the stars of the day were Millie and Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their cooler was the fullest by far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked back along the deck, Millie stepped on a slick patch of water and lost her balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Careful!&#34; someone shouted. In a flash, Myron caught her arm, steadying her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gasped and instinctively held onto him. It looked like she had fallen right into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, she felt something sharp-like needles pricking her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned around. Brandon was standing nearby,parked along the shore, eyes fixed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was watching everything.</p>
