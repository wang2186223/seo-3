                <p>With Brandon</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Vivian made her way to Crobert Hospital, the Internet was filled with comments about her diagnosis. Her name appeared across countless threads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest, I think Vivian&#39;s brave. She&#39;s clear about her feelings as well as boundaries. Quite impressive, actually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. A lot of people like Brandon. As long as she&#39;s not wrecking his marriage, her feelings are her own business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her older videos and that livestream from Crest Villa gave me a glimpse into rich people&#39;s lives. It&#39;s sad she won&#39;t be around much longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s Brandon&#39;s wife, though? Sheshould just let him be with Vivian. The girl has only six months left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know her. It&#39;s Millie Bennett, a musician. She stopped working after she got married and became a full-time housewife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Crobert Hospital, Millie&#39;s phone kept buzzing.Calls and messages came one after another. Some people acted concerned. Others wanted information.A few tried to mock her. All of it was about Vivian and Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had read just enough of the headlines to understand what was going on with Vivian&#39;s illness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t click on anything else.&#34;Any pain?&#34; She saw the strain on Millie&#39;s face and,without needing to be asked, reached out to help her rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave a small smile and shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had made up her mind. Some things simply had to be faced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia understood, but she just sighed and helped.Millie up. They took the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator doors soon opened at the ground floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hospital was packed. Even more than usual.Millie noticed a few reporters scattered in the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So many people today. Probably another celebrity here for a check-up,&#34; Alexia said. &#34;They always bring this kind of attention...&#34; She stopped at once, her face changing. She had seen something and quickly tried to lead Millie in the other direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was no point. Millie had already spotted them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t matter anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the divorce was finalized, Brandon would no longer be a part of her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She checked the time. When she looked up, she saw Alexia walking toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you feeling?&#34; Alexia asked, concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stood tall, striking in a way that drew attention without effort. The noise and movement around him didn&#39;t touch him-his hair perfectly in place, his suit smooth and sharp, like the chaos didn&#39;t dare come close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian stood beside him. She looked small and weak,her face pale, which made her seem even more fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lost her balance slightly. Brandon stepped in to catch her, shielding her from the cameras and the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t look,&#34; Alexia said quickly, stepping in front of Millie, her tone sharp with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexia, let&#39;s go,&#34; Millie said, her voice calm. She had made up her mind; Brandon didn&#39;t need to know she was there, and she had no interest in crossing paths with him now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why should we go?&#34; Alexia snapped, growing more furious. &#34;You&#39;re not divorced yet. He&#39;s still your husband. And he&#39;s here holding another woman like</p>
                
                
                
                <p>it&#39;s nothing.It&#39;s shameless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Husband...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked away, sighing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time she had secretly smiled just thinking about Brandon being her husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But not anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t feel well, Alexia. Let&#39;s just go,&#34; Millie said,changing the topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia gave her full attention now and stopped looking in Brandon and Vivian&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They left. Across the lobby, Vivian glanced over. A flicker of pride passed through her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Brandon. I didn&#39;t mean to drag you into this mess,&#34; she said, a tinge of remorse in her voice.&#34;I know you hate being in the spotlight...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; Brandon replied. &#34;Let&#39;s go see the doctor first.&#34; His face stayed calm, but something stirred in his thoughts-something brief, hard to name.They stepped into the consultation room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian handed over her medical record to the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor read through it, slowly,and frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This looks serious,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian gave a faint smile. &#34;I know,&#34; she said quietly.Then she took a slow breath. &#34;Please prescribe something strong for the pain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In your current condition, I suggest you stay in the hospital and begin treatment,&#34; the doctor said. &#34;You should try. There&#39;s still a chance we can extend your life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the point?&#34; Vivian gave a sad smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brushed away the tears building in her eyes, and then said quietly, &#34;I don&#39;t want treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s fingers curled tighter around hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a small shake of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor, I just want to spend the last phase of my lifewith some dignity,&#34; she said. &#34;So, please prescribe some strong painkillers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor sighed deeply but finally nodded in understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, reporters were taking photos and recording videos without pause before posting them online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People watching were emotional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good heavens, this is a real person whose life is ending.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I cry when I&#39;m in mild pain. I can&#39;t imagine what late-stage cancer feels like. But she still manages to smile. She&#39;s really strong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t hold back tears when she said she wouldn&#39;t go through treatment. Only people who&#39;ve faced serious illness understand this feeling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Public sympathy for Vivian reached its highest point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian soon got her medicine, and as she andBrandon walked out of the hospital, Millie was sitting on a bench nearby. She was waiting for Alexia, who had gone to get the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Millie could respond to what wNas happening,paparazzi noticed her and rushed over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The camera flashes came all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon saw her too. He frowned and asked, &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stood up, glanced at Brandon, and then at Vivian&#39;s hand resting on his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t speak yet. The crowd didn&#39;t give her the chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Watson, did you come because of what&#39;s online? Are you trying to catch them together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think of your husband being out in public with someone else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Watson, what are you planning to do about Vivian?&#34;People quickly decided that Millie had shown up on purpose-to face Vivian directly, to start something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Brandon thought the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian is sick. Didn&#39;t you know?&#34; he barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s voice was brimming with menace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie felt like laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was what he believed-that she was picking a fight on purpose with someone who was ill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon really didn&#39;t know her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Millie didn&#39;t answer, the reporters turned to Vivian, asking questions about breaking up someone&#39;s marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon looked at Millie again. &#34;Millie!&#34; he called.He wanted her to defend Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like always, he expected her to do what he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the will to please him was gone.She was walking away from him-there was no reason left to obey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie placed her right hand over her stomach. The dull ache was still there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to visit a friend,&#34; she said finally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to say more. Her pregnancy wasn&#39;t something she wanted to share-not before the divorce was finalized, not with all eyes on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reply to his question earlier was simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having answered Brandon, Millie turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the reporters didn&#39;t back off. They crowded in around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Watson, people online are asking you to step aside and let Mr. Watson be with Vivian. What do you say to that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian doesn&#39;t have long. Are you still going to fight her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs.Watson-&#34;Millie didn&#39;t bother responding; she just wanted to get away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd, thrilled to see the three of them in the same place at last, had no intention of letting it end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stood still, saying nothing, and that silence gave someone the boldness to shove Millie with force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She staggered, her arms moving at once to shield her stomach.</p>
