                <p>Millie&#39;s eyes rested on Myron standing before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had always been gentle, respectful, and considerate toward her, never once causing her pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought eased her heart, and a soft smile appeared on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; she said, keeping her hands on the ones that were gently holding her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ring on her finger caught the light and gave off a faint sparkle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past was behind her now, and now she was Myron&#39;s fiancee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have some water,&#34; Myron said, pouring a glass and offering it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie reached out to take it, letting her gaze drift to the view beyond the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the Elliott Group, isn&#39;t it?&#34; she asked,glancing around at the small side room connected to his office-a private spot clearly meant for his midday breaks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right.&#34; Myron gave a soft laugh and nodded before moving to the desk where an open stack of documents waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious he&#39;d been in the middle of work before noticing something was wrong and coming straight over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That awareness brought with it a feeling she wasn&#39;t used to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her cup in hand, Millie got to her feet and began wandering around the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her past visits here had been brief, always for business, since she usually worked out of her own rented office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today was different-she&#39;d fallen asleep in the car,and Myron had carried her here himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped in front of the tall floor-to-ceiling window,taking another sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It surprised her torealize how long she had slept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It reminded her of the times Alexia used to joke that she had a perfect sense for falling asleep on subway but waking up right before her stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the truth was, she had never truly slept deeply-only dozed off and on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about those days, Millie once again felt the weight of how much time had changed her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door pulled her from her thoughts,and she turned to see Myron&#39;s assistant standing in the doorway with a tray of snacks in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warm smile crossed the assistant&#39;s face as he gave Millie a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dinner&#39;s almost ready, so Mr. Elliott asked me to just</p>
                
                
                
                <p>bring you some light snacks to eat,&#34; Mack Stewart,the diligent assistant, explained while setting the tray down on a nearby table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie acknowledged him with a polite. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning her smile, Mack gave a small gesture toward Myron before turning to leave the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead-give them a try,&#34; Myron said without looking up from the papers in front of him. &#34;Adriana&#39;s been hunting down these treats, thinking they could be added into the package. She and Jayceon? I&#39;m not exactly sold on their cooking, but I&#39;ll admit they know where to find good food.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment brought to mind the time when Jayceon had tried to make scrambled eggs for them,which turned out to be a total disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small laugh escaped her as she glanced down at the neatly arranged snacks, which looked far more appealing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up a piece of pastry and took a bite. It</p>
                
                
                
                <p>was actually good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is delicious,&#34; Millie said with genuine appreciation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Glad to hear it,&#34; Myron replied, a faint chuckle in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to disturb him while he worked, she mentioned she might take a walk around the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking up, he nodded in approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she stepped outside, Mack caught sight of her. &#34;Miss Bennett, would you like me to join you for a tour?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head lightly, waving him off to show she was just wandering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In that case, I have something for you,&#34; Mack said,handing her a leash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s eyes dropped to it and quickly traced the other end-where a plump orange tabby cat sat patiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Elliott said you&#39;re fond of cats. This is Orange,our company&#39;s lucky mascot. It&#39;s friendly and likes to roam around. Let it give you a tour,&#34; Mack added</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious, Millie crouched down and gently scratched under the cat&#39;s chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meow!&#34; The cat purred and rubbed its head against Millie&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought crossed her mind that Ari would probably adore this cat too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small nod, she accepted the basket of cat treats from Mack. &#34;Alright, thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Orange. Show me around,&#34; she said to the cat with a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meow!&#34; it answered before munching on a freeze-dried treat from her palm, and then flicked its tail and walked ahead as if it understood her perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they moved through the building, some employees at the Elliott Group either didn&#39;t even recognize her, some greeted her with friendly smniles,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>occasionally bending down to pet the cat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie let the cat guide her as she wandered about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Elliott Group had a warmer, more welcoming atmosphere compared to the Watson Group, which focused heavily on efficiency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many areas in the Watson Group had a cold, purely businesslike interior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here, each floor of the Elliott Group had its own personality-some leaned toward efficiency, while others felt playful and imaginative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear the style of each floor reflected the taste of its department head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon and Adriana each had their own office and separate floors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon rarely came by, preferring to work elsewhere, but Adriana happened to be in that day and greeted Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meow!&#34; The cat proudly lifted its head as it led Millie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to another floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stepped out of the elevator and found the entire space filled with cat-themed merchandise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Orange!&#34; someone called out when they spotted the cat, hurrying over to scoop it into their arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meow!&#34; Orange purred in delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person looked up at Millie with a smile. &#34;Miss Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave a polite nod, curiosity sparking. &#34;What is this place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This little one inspired an entire jewelry collection,&#34;the person responded, holding Orange securely.&#34;Come with me, Miss Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked together, the person continued,&#34;This is Orange&#39;s Eye, an emerald.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze landed on the piece, and the resemblance to the cat was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This one&#39;s shaped like a tail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And that&#39;s the paw design.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, this charm was modeled after cat testicles-made to look like a pair of playful bells. Of course,Orange doesn&#39;t have them anymore since he&#39;s been neutered...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meow!&#34; Orange let out a sharp, offended cry</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, alright, I&#39;m sorry,&#34; the person said quickly,trying to soothe the cat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie chuckled and handed over a few treats for the employee to give Orange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Orange appeared, more employees drifted over to join them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our accessories sell really well. Here, Miss Bennett,&#34;one of them said, holding out their phone to show her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen displayed countless photos of pets wearing the products around their necks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some people had repurposed them into keychains or bag charms, while others strung several together to create bracelets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The cat bell charm is especially a favorite,&#34; another employee said with an easy smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie took her time studying each design, genuinely impressed by their originality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lingered there, still looking over the display,when someone stepped into the view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her gaze, she saw Myron holding the cat and gently scratching its chin. &#34;We should head out,&#34; he said with a small smile. &#34;Charles and the others are already waiting for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, he added, &#34;You can take Orange along to play with Ari if you&#39;d like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they left, he clipped a cat bell charm to her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lit up as she admired the cute tiny accessory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on,&#34; Myron said. &#34;Let&#39;s not keep them waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing out the window, she noticed the sky had deepened into dusk-it really was time to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over at the restaurant, Charles and Giffard were already seated, with Alexia beside them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s eyes moved from Charles to Giffard before a long,quiet sigh escaped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie said yes to Myron, and now the question hung over them about where the two of them would go from here.</p>
