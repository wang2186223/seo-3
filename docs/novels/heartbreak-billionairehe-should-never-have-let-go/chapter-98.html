                <p>Babette narrowed her eyes at Millie. &#34;So, you&#39;ve decided to abandon the Bennett family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie took a step forward, closing the space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that a threat?&#34; she asked, her voice cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette gave a low, mirthless laugh. &#34;Hasn&#39;t it always been a threat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;I thought this was a negotiation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette sneered. &#34;You&#39;re just a woman clinging to the Watson family to survive. What makes you think you have the right to negotiate with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, she waved her phone, the screen lit with a message from Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she pointed toward a side door, where Brandon stood, deep in conversation-with Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even dressed plainly, there was no mistaking her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s lips curled faintly. Just moments ago, Brandon had refused Vivian&#39;s calls in front of her. And now here he was, bringing her in person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon hasn&#39;t loved you for a long time,&#34;Babette said flatly.&#34;Your time in the Watson family is almost up. What are you planning to do-wait for Vivian to die, pretend nothing happened and then keep playing the role of Mrs. Watson? It&#39;s not going to happen. Trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie didn&#39;t look away. Her eyes were still fixed on Brandon, who leaned in close to Vivian, pointing at something on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their closeness, even in the dim light, was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Had enough?&#34; Babette asked, her voice cutting. &#34;Vivian and I are working together. Taking over the Bennett family&#39;s remaining ties inside the Watson Group will be easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie finally turned back to face her. Babette smiled. &#34;Your family&#39;s glory died with James.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she saw the flickerin Millie&#39;s expression, Babette&#39;s laughter grew louder, more biting. &#34;How does it feel? Do you hate me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But underneath the taunt, there was something else in her eyes-something heavy, something close to sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate you more than you&#39;ll ever know,&#34;Babette whispered. &#34;Didn&#39;t you win him, Millie? Let&#39;s make a bet. If you win, I&#39;ll leave the Bennett family&#39;s old connections alone. But if you lose, you have two options-let me take over those connections... or tell me the truth about what happened in Flesta all those years ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swirled the wine in her glass. &#34;We&#39;ll bet on this wine. See all those glasses on the table? Choose the one you think is &#39;Miss&#39;. Pick correctly, and you win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stared at her, a wave of sadness rising in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t the Babette I once knew,&#34; she said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The proud, poised Babette would never have resorted to such low tactics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had she changed? And why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, are you afraid to bet?&#34; Babette&#39;s voice had hardened, but there was a tremor in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie smiled faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Egbert&#39;s vineyard in southwest Flesta,&#34; she began,&#34;isknown for producing wines with smooth texture and rich, fruity notes. He crafted this wine himself, four years ago. It&#39;s ruby red-clean, with a deep finish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette&#39;s smile began to falter as Millie spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This,&#34; Millie continued, gesturing toward the table, &#34;is a private collection. You wouldn&#39;t risk serving an inferior wine at your own party. Not when you&#39;re trying to secure yourplace in Crobert&#39;s elite circles.You wouldn&#39;t fake something Egbert gave you, either. Shall I go on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette said nothing. Millie walked slowly to the tasting table, scanned the glasses, and selected one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a small sip, and then returned, glass in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wine shimmered like a jewel under the lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she saw the flickerin Millie&#39;s expression, Babette&#39;s laughter grew louder, more biting. &#34;How does it feel? Do you hate me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But underneath the taunt, there was something else in her eyes-something heavy, something close to sorrow.</p>

                <p>She swirled the wine in her glass. &#34;We&#39;ll bet on this wine. See all those glasses on the table? Choose the one you think is &#39;Miss&#39;. Pick correctly, and you win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stared at her, a wave of sadness rising in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t the Babette I once knew,&#34; she said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The proud, poised Babette would never have resorted to such low tactics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had she changed? And why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, are you afraid to bet?&#34; Babette&#39;s voice had hardened, but there was a tremor in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie smiled faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Egbert&#39;s vineyard in southwest Flesta,&#34; she began,&#34;isknown for producing wines with smooth texture and rich, fruity notes. He crafted this wine himself, four years ago. It&#39;s ruby red-clean, with a deep finish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette&#39;s smile began to falter as Millie spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This,&#34; Millie continued, gesturing toward the table, &#34;is a private collection. You wouldn&#39;t risk serving an inferior wine at your own party.

Shall I go on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette said nothing. Millie walked slowly to the tasting table, scanned the glasses, and selected one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a small sip, and then returned, glass in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wine shimmered like a jewel under the lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In his early days, he was cruel-everyone knew it. He went through business deals and walked away like they were games. What made you different? What did you do, Millie? What did you give him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked at her calmly, her grip steady on the glass. &#34;You said it yourself, Babette. It wasn&#39;t me. It was the Watson Group&#39;s technical breakthrough that changed everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words she had used to discredit Millie had now been turned back on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in doing so, they revealed the fact that Babette had believed Millie was at the heart of it all without even realizing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Red-eyed, Babette stared at her in silence. Millie didn&#39;t return the gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she asked quietly,&#34;what&#39;s the verdict? Did I win? If so, then the Bennett family&#39;s-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t win!&#34; Babette suddenly screamed. Her voice sliced through the hum of the crowd, drawing eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that glass is &#39;Miss&#39;-but so what?&#34; Her laugh was sharp, almost manic. &#34;The Bennett family is gone, Millie. It&#39;s nothing now. What remains now is just a department under the Watson Group&#39;sthumb.Your father is dead. Even if you picked the right wine, what does it-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Babette could finish, Millie calmly lifted the glass and poured the ruby liquid over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wine streamed down Babette&#39;s cheek, staining her skin, soaking her gown. The deep red clung like blood to her designer dress.</p>
