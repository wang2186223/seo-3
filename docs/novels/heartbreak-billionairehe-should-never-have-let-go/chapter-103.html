                <p>As the music swelled, Serena&#39;s dance, voice, and shimmering lyre wove together, casting a luminous,otherworldly spell across the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved like a vision conjured from a dream-so light, so mesmerizing, the audience barely dared to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All at once, the audience and the livestream viewers fell under her enchantment, captivated beyond words</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon, who had been a bundle of nerves at the start, now sat transfixed, his eyes wide with amazement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was flawless!&#34; he blurted, unable to contain his awe. &#34;Two languages, two instruments, two completely different stage styles-and she&#39;s blended them into this seamless, beautiful journey. There&#39;s nothing forced about it! The song&#39;s name is &#39;Journey,and it fits perfectly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He practically vibrated with excitement, unable to sit still as Serena&#39;s fanboy energy took over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Adriana forgot to bicker with her brother this d Rise time,completely caught up in the sheer spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside them, Myron lingered in the shadows, lips curving into a subtle, knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd buzzed with astonishment, and online,where arguments had raged just moments earlier, the comment section exploded with admiration instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s out of this world!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing left to say that captures how I feel!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watching her play the lyre was simply mesmerizing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, every heated argument faded into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was only the opening act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night held far more surprises in store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the stage went dark again, Serena&#39;s performance soared to even greater heights. Panoramas of distant lands appeared, painting the backdrop with scenes from another world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Iconic moments from classic operas flickered across the screen, captivating the entire audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Serena reappeared, dressed in a sweeping gown Would Rise that shimmered beneath the spotlights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mask adorned her face, heightening the sense of drama, and she carried a violin with regal poise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena drew her bow, and the violin burst to life,weaving an utterly spellbinding tapestry of sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the song swelled, Vivian&#39;s easy smile curdled into a strained grimace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d all practiced together, but every contestant kept a personal trick up their sleeve-as long as it passed staff approval, anything went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the semifinals underway, alliances had dissolved;there were no teams now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each person was out for themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaw clenched, Vivian darted a covert glance around the table, and then fired off a discreet message to Oakley. &#34;Didn&#39;t you promise to talk to Napier and keep Charles in check? What&#39;s happening? Why is there nothing wrong with the live stream?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley&#39;s response came back just as fast. &#34;How would I know? | already told Grandpa about Charles messing around with Serena-about her getting pregnant,too.He was pissed. But after that mess with Millie, I tried again, and guess what he said?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He just shrugged it off. He told me to focus on the company and stop bringing him any more dirt on Charles. I&#39;m so fed up!&#34; Oakley paced restlessly,frustration simmering just beneath his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d thought everything was locked down-Napier had always been eager to help, yet suddenly,the man was acting like none of it mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where had things gone off the rails?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He replayed the timeline in his mind, every detail grating on his nerves. The shift started right after Serena and Napier&#39;s meeting at that auction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course-Serena!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>HHe shot a sharp, calculating look toward the stage,watching Serena bask in the spotlight. A knot of resentment twisted inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Vivian&#39;s message flashed across his screen again. &#34;I don&#39;t care. Make something happen, Oakley.We&#39;re in this together. If Serena gets ahead, we&#39;re both finished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley bristled, his jaw tightening. He still hadn&#39;t forgiven Vivian for seling him out last time, but he tamped down the urge to snap at her. Instead, his Would Rise reply was curt and tight. &#34;I get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pocketing his phone, Oakley stepped away from the sidelines and headed straight for the control room, his mind racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he was going to sabotage Serena, there was no move more direct and effective than pulling the plug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was already the fourth live show-if Serena managed to reach the finals now, neither of them would ever catch up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was convinced now-someone in his crew was leaking information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How else could Charles keep preempting his every move?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a scowl, he crept toward the master switch,heart thudding as he reached out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy fist crashed into his jaw before he could touch it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn!&#34; Oakley hit the floor hard, dazed, pain radiating through his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles stepped from the shadows, a self-satisfied grin tugging at his lips as he casually shook out his knuckles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Told you, Oakley. You&#39;re way too predictable,&#34;Charles drawled, voice edged with mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley scrambled up, fists clenched, but before he could make a move, a wall of bodyguards swarmed out of the darkness, hemming him in from every side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles let out a booming laugh, genuinely amused by the fury twisting Oakley&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Oakley. Stop resorting to these cheap tricks.&#34; He sneered, pausing for effect. &#34;If you want to win, maybe try using your head for once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley huffed, his eyes rolling skyward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The irony of Charles-renowned for his explosive outbursts-lecturing him about using his head was almost laughable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You lucked out with Serena, didn&#39;t you? Let&#39;s see how you handle things without her for once!&#34; Oakley shot back, voice bristling with challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles arched a brow, unbothered. &#34;You want a girlfriend? Go get one. Not my problem,&#34; he remarked,waving a lazy hand at his subordinates to stay sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then smirked, snapping, &#34;Some of us have actual charisma. Wouldn&#39;t expect you to get it,though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, Charles turned and strode toward the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused at the edge, eyes fixed on Serena under the spotlight, a sly satisfaction playing at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t told Oakley the truth-that there was nothing going on between him and Serena. But who cared? There was nothing better than watching him pissed and frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Serena&#39;s performance swept into its fourth act, capturing the essence of yet another country with every bold,passionate movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The spotlight found her in a scarlet dress, her solo tango radiating such energy that even without a partner, the romance of the dance seemed to swirl around her like living fire. The accordion&#39;s notes flickered through the theater, electrifying the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39; gaze locked on Millie as she commanded the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t anticipated a break like this, but he recognized a gift when it landed in his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie-once obsessed with the Watson Group and shackled to restoring the Bennett family&#39;s glories-had been forced by their alliance to rely on him for the first time. He&#39;d grabbed that chance with both hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick glance at his phone revealed a frenzy: Evans Entertainment, Seville, and Alexia had whipped the public-opinion machine into a storm, fueling the hype online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had seemed an uphill battle was now tipping effortlessly in their favor, all because Millie&#39;s performance was too dazzling to deny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles pocketed his phone, unable to suppress a sharp,satisfied laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Internet had labeled Millie a pitiful, clingy housewife-someone desperate to clutch at the Watson family&#39;s money. They couldn&#39;t have been more wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was simple-whoever Millie stood with would rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles knew it firsthand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d spent years scraping for scraps behind his older brothers, barely a blip on his grandfather&#39;s radar. But since joining forces with Millie on Heavenly Melody,everything had changed. For the first time,his family saw him as someone worth betting on.</p>
