                <p>Millie had seen this day coming since she&#39;d slipped that unique clause into the agreement from the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d sat down with a lawyer well before moving on with her plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s name sat neatly at the bottom of the agreement they had signed. As long as nothing went awry, the approval could go straight through company channels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene studied his copy of the paperwork,worry flickering across his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no question of authenticity-Millie still had the original, and Brandon kept his version, giving,Eugene all the proof he needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Watson, this...&#34; Eugene said, only to trail off as the staccato rhythm of high heels echoed closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette&#39;s voice cut through, full of curjosity &#34;Eugene? Millie? What are you two doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With practiced ease, Eugene tucked the document out of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hosting her now-famous wine tasting, Babette had joined the Watson Group for good-not part of the finance team, but overseeing overseas business especially concerning Flesta and pitching in with her father&#39;s division.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She approached with purpose, a document clutched in her hand, and joined them without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp glance landed on Eugene as Babette asked,&#34;What&#39;s all this about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her attention snapped to Millie. &#34;Brandon&#39;s in the hospital, you know. So what brings you here right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether Brandon was ill or not made no difference to Millie&#39;s agenda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today was about settling property matters-a step she&#39;d planned well in advance, complete with legal counsel ready to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping things tidy and free from Babette&#39;s interference was Millie&#39;s goal; she just wanted the Bennett family&#39;s assets back, no drama attached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle gesture from Millie urged Eugene to move the conversation somewhere more private.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette blocked their exit, suspicion flashing in her eyes. &#34;Where are you sneaking off to? Up to something behind closed doors?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without flinching, Millie replied, &#34;There&#39;s nothing secret here. I&#39;m separating what&#39;s mine from the Watson Group, that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette asked further, her voice sharp, &#34;You mean even that division?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Naturally.&#34; Millie&#39;s answer came cool and quick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh burst from Babette. &#34;Are you out of your mind, Millie? That department&#39;s already absorbed by the Watson Group. There&#39;s no pulling it out now-it doesn&#39;t belong to you anymore!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babette.&#34; Millie didn&#39;t hesitate. Taking a step forward, she leveled a cold gaze at Babette. &#34;Asset division between Brandon and me isn&#39;t your concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flush of anger crept up Babette&#39;s cheeks. &#34;You-!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie, unfazed, turned away and addressed Eugene,saying, &#34;Let&#39;s pick up where we left off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to give ground, Babette shot Eugene a look that dared him to say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brushed her own paperwork aside, pulled out her phone, and dialed Brandon. &#34;Just wait, Millie.Brandon&#39;s not about to let you walk off with anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s gaze flicked to thephone in Babette&#39;s hand,expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene spoke up, a note of caution in his voice.&#34;Mrs. Watson, this has to go through Mr. Watson personally. Even with these papers, his approval is required.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick glance passed between Millie and Darrion,silent understanding flashing between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both had expected Brandon would need to sign off before anything was finalized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Millie would have preferred to wrap things up without any more detours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calm resolve, she addressed Eugene, saying,&#34;From now on, just call me Millie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Eugene wavered. In the end,he nodded and made compromise. &#34;Yes, Miss Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette rolled her eyes with a huff. &#34;What a hypocrite!&#34; she grumbled under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Babette&#39;s call connected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s voice filtered through, steady and cool.&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting a second, Babette chimed in,&#34;Brandon, Millie&#39;s here, trying to take the  department. She&#39;s in the office right now-are you aware of this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy pause followed; Brandon said nothing at first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie waited quietly, her eyes on Babette, listening as the call played out on speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds ticked by in thick silence. Babette grew impatient. &#34;Brandon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Brandon&#39;s answer came, firm and final.&#34;She&#39;s not getting it. Tell her that&#39;s from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, the line went dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grin of victory spread across Babette&#39;s face.&#34;There you have it. Did you catch that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave Eugene a steady look. &#34;Then we&#39;ll go through the courts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a hint of rattle disturbed her poise; to her, this was just business as usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One brief nod to Darrion signaled the end of the meeting. Together, they turned and walked out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the elevator doors slid shut, Babette&#39;s warning rang out behind them. &#34;Millie, don&#39;t waste your timne!It&#39;s not gonna happen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither spoke as they rode the elevator to the lobby,silence hanging heavy until they walked out of the Watson Group building. Only then did Darrion break the silence. &#34;Miss Bennett,we always knew this was a likely outcome. It&#39;s no surprise the Watson Group won&#39;t hand things over easily. We&#39;ll just move forward with the legal process. Given the evidence and documentation you&#39;ve provided-your odds are strong, whether through settlement or purchase.Still, litigation will take longer than a direct division.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cars drifted past on the busy street, their lights reflected in Millie&#39;s eyes as she watched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a quiet nod in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Legal proceedings had been part of her plan all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What caught her off guard was how Brandon had flatly refused, leaving no room for compromise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought back to all those nights he&#39;d promised her-swearing the Bennett family assets were only under Watson Group&#39;s care for the time being.He&#39;d pledged to find answers about her father&#39;s death and help restore her family&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he wouldn&#39;t even let her reclaim what was rightfully hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Promises from men, she realized, were often just fleeting words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least she&#39;d never pinned much hope on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Millie, today was just a box to be checked-one more step in a plan that was always hers alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be counting on your expertise from here on out,Mr. Clark,&#34; Millie remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darrion replied smoothly, &#34;It&#39;s my responsibility. Still,Miss Bennett, you should brace yourself-this won&#39;t be settled overnight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nod from Millie showed her understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their conversation ended there, and Millie made herway back to her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she slid into the driver&#39;s seat, her phonevibrated with an incoming message. &#34;| know a skilleddivorce attorney. He&#39;ll be in touch with you thisafternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost immediately, another text arrived.&#34;Babette&#39;slatest post made your situation clear to me. l&#39;m hereto help-no hidden agenda,l promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The messages were signed by Myron</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d even included a screenshot of Babette&#39;s socialfeed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette&#39;s post read,&#34;Running off with her tailbetween her legs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath her words,a photo captured Millie&#39;sretreating figure as she stepped into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Brandon came across Babette&#39;s latest post as he scrolled through social media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown creased his brow as he switched to her chat and fired off a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take it down. Don&#39;t air today&#39;s business in public,&#34;he instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette grumbled her complaints, but she ended up deleting the post anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to his messages with Millie, Brandon started typing, &#34;That wasn&#39;t my idea-she posted on her own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thumb hovered over the send button. In the end,he left it unsent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would it even matter to Millie? She probably wouldn&#39;t believe him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, Brandon deleted the unsent message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fever was gone now, and a night&#39;s rest had started to bring him back to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Babette called earlier, his assistant had beer sorting out his hospital discharge papers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, Brandon always knew the Bennett assets were rightfully Millie&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he couldn&#39;t bring himself to release his hold on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logic settled back in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already run through the possibilities: a court battle could last three months on a fast track, or half a year on a standard schedule-with plenty of time for both rounds of trial, easily covering the next five months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden&#39;s words from the night before echoed in his mind-&#34;Millie was furious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over these next five months, he would have to stay close to Vivian, but he couldn&#39;t let Millie slipaway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five months from now, Brandon planned to put the whole truth in front of Millie-no more secrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days blurred together, and before long, the finals for Heavenly Melody were almost here.</p>
