                <p>The trio headed to the private elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they ascended, Babette and Eugene quickly filled Brandon in on the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before the elevator doors opened, Babette,acting on impulse, asked, &#34;Did you and Millie really get divorced?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed further. &#34;Is what she posted real? Did the two of you actually sign the papers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t respond right away. He then nodded without looking at her, stepped out and made his way toward the meeting room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette followed, trailing behind with a conflicted expression. She opened her mouth to speak but said nothing,quietly catching up to face the crowd inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Millie and Myron had just finished lunch and were now visiting one of Elliott Group&#39;s jewelry stores.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked, Myron explained the various divisions within the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over lunch,he had learned about the agreement Millie had recently signed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t kept it a secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, her win at Heavenly Melody had brought her commercials here, and she wasn&#39;t rigid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood that Brandon would back Vivian, and in her eyes, accepting help and forming practical,mutually beneficial relationships was only logical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief tour of the regular businesses, Myron led her down a winding corridor to a quieter part of the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They passed several security checkpoints before pausing at the last one for a short conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you hear what happened at Watson Group?&#34;Myron asked, glancing at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded. She had expected fallout once the divorce became public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;&#39;I&#39;ve said before,&#34; she replied calmly, &#34;that his affairs have nothing to do with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not what I meant.&#34; Myron smiled. &#34;Tomorrow,when the market opens, Watson Group&#39;s stock will probably take a hit. Don&#39;t you want to do something about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie met his gaze with a steady look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are certain things I don&#39;t want to be part of,&#34;she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And yet there will always be people who do,&#34; Myron replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They held each other&#39;s gaze. Millie knew exactly what he meant. He must have predicted everything when he saw her announcement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a public divorce, rumors about a massive settlement were inevitable. The stock price was bound to fluctuate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why he had said, &#34;I thought you might want to wait a little longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was perceptive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems I need to reevaluate you, Mr. Elliott,&#34; Millie said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m flattered,&#34; he answered with polite charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They exchanged a subtle, knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smart people always knew when to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the click of high heels echoed down the hallway. Adriana approached with a bright smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There you are,&#34; she greeted warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie turned from Myron and returned the smile.&#34;Hello,Miss Elliott.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just call me Adriana,&#34; she said and hen led them farther in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They made their way to a compact storeroom filled with gemstones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are the new pieces we plan to launch,&#34; Adriana explained. &#34;I was managing them, but Myron just told me he&#39;ll be overseeing them now, in line with our agreement with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie glanced at the six gemstones on display. Each one was remarkably rare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your contract with Elliott Group guarantees the corresponding endorsements,&#34; Myron said as he guided Millie to examine them up close. &#34;The marketing for this collection is in your hands now.Let&#39;s see what you can do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gems sparkled under the showroom lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked up at him. &#34;How much creative control do I have?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Total freedom,&#34; he said with a confident smile.&#34;You&#39;re free to approach it however you like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s lips parted slightly. She didn&#39;t quite understand why he was offering her so much leeway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since he confessed his feelings, she hadn&#39;t fully grasped his intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked back at the gems and said, &#34;Don&#39;t worry.You&#39;ll be more than satisfied with the results.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m counting on it,&#34; Myron replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, chaos was erupting inside Watson Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What began as gossip had quickly spread to the finance world. Now, major financial bloggers were dissecting Brandon and Millie&#39;s divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One well-known blogger posted, &#34;We&#39;ve seen this pattern before. A public divorce leads to stock splits,and the wife cashes out at the peak. These so-called &#39;sky-high divorce settlements&#39; tend to rattle the market.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comments poured in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember when I got hit with three limit-downs because of a divorce scandal. Never again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same here. I was stuck holding stock I couldn&#39;t even sell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are Brandon and Millie about to pull the same move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No idea. But seriously, I should&#39;ve known something was up when Brandon kept going out in public with Vivian. She&#39;s practically on her deathbed, and she&#39;s still clinging to him. Can&#39;t she let Millie and Brandon live their lives? She&#39;s dragging down the whole company!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When the market opens tomorrow, it&#39;s every man for himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the Watson Group meeting room, Brandon&#39;s expression had turned stormy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room buzzed with conversations, video calls, and nonstop questions from all directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We just got a call from Eldoria,&#34; someone reported.&#34;They said Millie used to handle communications.Now that the divorce is public, they don&#39;t know how to proceed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Watson, partners from Vascuosia are asking what Millie&#39;s next role will be and how the transition is being managed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s more...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the tension mounted, a Rolls-Royce Phantom pulled up outside the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His features blending seamlessly with the locals-except for his eyes, which had a faint reddish hue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless you were paying close attention, you wouldn&#39;t notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked into the building and took the elevator to the meeting room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he reached the guarded door, the staff member quickly went inside to announce him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the doors opened and the man walked in. &#34;It&#39;s been a while, Brandon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the far end of the table, Brandon&#39;s brow tightened at the familiar voice. He looked up, his eyes narrowing at the figure now standing in the doorway</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him,Babette immediately stepped forward with a welcoming smile. &#34;You&#39;re here, Egbert.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw the news and thought we should talk about our collaboration,&#34; Egbert said, his gaze fixed on Brandon.&#34;You know how that contract came to be in the first place, after all.&#34;</p>
