                <p>Alexia stared at the filing receipt, surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Millie had been close friends for more than ten years, and in all that time, Alexia had seen just how hard Millie loved Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time Millie could have died for him, and nobody would have questioned it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got married a year ago. Alexia had smiled at the wedding, even though something about their pairing felt off. But still, Millie had gotten what she wanted.That had been enough for Alexia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now this...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t love him anymore,&#34; Millie said, before Alexia could ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked over and gave a small, calm smile.In that smile, Alexia caught a glimpse of the old Millie -the one from before everything collapsed, before grief carved deep lines into her, before her father&#39;s death and the fall of the Bennett family changed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It brought Alexia a strange sense of calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon doesn&#39;t know I&#39;m pregnant,&#34; Millie said calmly. &#34;And before the divorce becomes final, I don&#39;t want to take any risks. It&#39;s better if he doesn&#39;t know.&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If either party changed their mind before the divorce was finalized, they could take back the application,and the procedure would no longer go through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that was when Alexia knew that Millie wasn&#39;t playing around about divorcing Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking it all in, Alexia did what needed to be done: she booked Millie&#39;s medical tests and then advised carefully, &#34;Wait a few days before the surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie frowned in confusion.&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know your blood type-Rh-negative. It&#39;s rare.We need time to prepare blood, just in case. I&#39;ve already contacted the blood bank. They said it might take a week.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie went quiet. The sadness in her eyes was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had gotten that blood type from her father. And now she missed him all over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he were still here...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Millie nodded slowly. A smile tugged at her lips, but her eyes turned red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You also have early signs of miscarriage. You need to be careful these next few days,&#34; Alexia added,her voice full of concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d grown up together, and Alexia knew Millie&#39;s sadness too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held Millie&#39;s hand. &#34;Wait for me. My shift&#39;s almost over. I&#39;ll go home with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded, and then went to wait in the hallway.She looked down at her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Early signs of miscarriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did the baby know what she&#39;d decided and want to leave first?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pursing her lips, Millie walked toward the lab for the tests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone buzzed. It was a bank notification.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had opened a new account-one that Brandon wouldn&#39;t know about. She was keeping her money cleanly separate before the divorce was finalized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every cent she earned from now on would live in that account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second message followed. &#34;Payment for composition and lyrics has been completed.Finance has sent the transfer. Kindly confirm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she married Brandon, Millie had worked quietly as an anonymous songwriter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Music had always been her first love. Back when herfather was alive, life had been generous, and she lacked nothing. As the Bennett family&#39;s only daughter, she had the freedom and the means to grow her gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The turns her life had taken had taught her things she hadn&#39;t known she needed to learn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe her father never thought that the pastime he once encouraged would one day be the very thing.keeping her afloat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie paused, and then typed back, &#34;Money received. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reply came quickly. &#34;It&#39;s what you deserve.You&#39;ve written a lotof hits over the years. Why don&#39;t you return? There&#39;s a new show coming up. It fits you perfectly. I&#39;ve sent details to your email. Reserved a contestant slot just for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie opened her email. A new message sat at the top, inviting her to join a music competition show.The format was familiar, like others she had seen before, but this one wanted something original.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She typed out a quick reply. &#34;I&#39;ll think about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she set her phone down. A light cramp curled in her lower belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought of her father again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second time today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,the Internet was buzzing with updates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>#VivianSimpsonStomachCancer</p>
                
                
                
                <p>#FloristVivianSimpsonCountdown</p>
                
                
                
                <p>#LastSixMonths</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The most trending post was a video featuring a reporter summarizing the news about Vivian.&#34;Sources confirm that the well-known floral designer,Vivian Simpson, has been diagnosed with stomach cancer. She&#39;s been given six months to live. But instead of retreating, she&#39;s choosing to document her remaining time-she wants to share her life with the world as it winds down.&#34;The video cut to Vivian. She looked at the camera with a sad smile. &#34;In these last six months, I&#39;ll be posting updates about my life. I&#39;m not doing it for attention. I just want to offer some comfort to others going through the same thing. I hope you all stay strong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the reporter came back on screen. &#34;There have long been whispers about Miss Simpson and Mr.Brandon Watson, CEO of Watson Group. But Mr.Watson is married. It remains to be seen if he&#39;ll reconnect with Miss Simpson during her final months.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the background, Vivian seemed to have heard that part. She stepped forward, stopped beside the reporter, and gently cut in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She faced the camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not ashamed to say I like Brandon. He&#39;s an incredible man,&#34; shesaid. &#34;I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only.one who feels that way. But I want to make it clear-I&#39;m not going to break up someone&#39;s marriage.That&#39;s not who l am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having said that, she walked off, leaving the reporter behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wove through the small crowd with a smile and climbed into a waiting car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The foreign caregiver from Flaville passed her a glass of water, hand paused in midair, unsure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look like you want to say something,&#34; Vivian.said, her voice cold. &#34;Go ahead. The driver&#39;s one of ours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver leaned in and lowered their voice.&#34;Miss Simpson, your diagnosis... it&#39;s a stomach ulcer.Having our facility change that into cancer is already risky. But now you&#39;re sharing it with the public online?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian gave a sharp laugh, startling the caregiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your facility-is it a licensed medical facility?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver nodded.&#34;And does it manage my medical record privately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver gave another nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that what my medical record says-that I have six months left because of terminal stomach cancer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver hesitated before nodding again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly!&#34; Vivian leaned back with a smile. &#34;It&#39;s official, then. No one can question it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you don&#39;t actually have stomach cancer. What happens later...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are two ways out,&#34; Vivian said, cutting in. Her voice was sharper now, her eyes harder. &#34;One: I make a miraculous recovery during treatment at your facility or somewhere else, maybe because of all the love l&#39;ve received. Two: your facility gets blamed for a diagnostic error and months of wrong treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her face fully to the caregiver, looking more intimidating. &#34;Which option do you prefer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver looked panicked but forced out theat most words. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Miss Simpson. I understand.You&#39;ve already thought everything through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian gave a short, cold smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where should we go next, Miss Simpson?&#34; the caregiver asked in an attempt to lighten the mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian glanced at her phone. &#34;Crobert Hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver stiffened.&#34;But-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax. I&#39;m only going in for pain relief with my medical record,&#34; Vivian said, and then reached for her phone and sent Brandon a message, telling him to meet her at the hospital later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost instantly, he replied, &#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Millie stood in the hospital restroom, a steady ache pulling at her lower stomach. In her hand was a tissue, the smear of blood clear against the white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an early sign of a miscarriage.</p>
