                <p>&#34;Wow! That&#39;s incredible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd inside the venue wasn&#39;t the only one left speechless. The online audience exploded with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie hadnever spoken up in public about Brandon and Vivian&#39;s affair before, but this marked her first bold response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a face-off, clear and unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A showdown playing out live!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always thought Millie was someone who&#39;d just stay quiet and take the hit, but now she&#39;s standing up with some serious courage!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, I live for this drama. Watching them go head-to-head on camera is pure gold!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie&#39;s fearless! Right here at Elliott Group&#39;s event, with Myron chasing after her, she still puts up her wedding photo for all to see. That&#39;s bold!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Social media feeds buzzed with nonstop chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie read the comments flying by and listened to live updates throug her earpiece, her eyes sparkling with quiet satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Vivian wanted to stir trouble by live-streaming from Millie and Brandon&#39;s old place, Millie was more than ready to turn the tables.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Vivian loved that wedding photo? Perfect. Millie made sure it was front and center for the world to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing the camera, Millie flashed a knowing smile and asked, &#34;Vivian, you never answered me. Do you like the display?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,all eyes were on Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian hesitated and then forced a grin, but it didn&#39;t have the same confidence as Millie&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s lovely,&#34; Vivian replied, her tone laced with false sweetness. Her eyes shone with a practiced vulnerability as she added, &#34;I just didn&#39;t realze you&#39;d held onto that,photo. Maybe Brandon&#39;s still onyour mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave a gentle nod and then replied, &#34;Some people are simply unforgettable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seven years together, two children, and every wound he left behind. None of that ever truly faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s confident smile began to crack. She glanced awkwardly at the flowers, leting out a small cough as if to play the part of the innocent, wounded party, hoping viewers would see her as the one being wronged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Vivian changed tactics.where should I go next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out another delicate cough, milking her role as the &#34;wronged beauty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The bathroom? The study?&#34; she mused, dragging out the suspense. Then Vivian tossed out a bolder suggestion, eyes wide and seemingly sincere. &#34;Or should I take everyone on a tour of your bedroom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the surface, Vivian&#39;s face stayed sweet, but a flash of defiance glinted in her eyes, like someone fighting to protect what she believed was hers.①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment section exploded once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Viewers couldn&#39;t get enough of the tension between the two as they eagerly waited for Millie&#39;s comeback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But MAillie just answered with a dazzling, unbothered smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian, you&#39;ve got it all wrong. That used to be our home and our bedroom,but not anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s tone was light, steady, and completely fearless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon is my ex-husband. Everything on display today belongs to the past. I&#39;m no longer married to Brandon. That</p>
