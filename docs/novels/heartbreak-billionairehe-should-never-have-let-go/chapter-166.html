                <p>Millie smiled. &#34;Well... Let&#39;s save that firework show for when things become official between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron was briefly taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie met his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I accept your offer. Let&#39;s try to get to know each other better,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past few days, he had never crossed any lne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t pressured her or made anything difficult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most importantly, Ari really liked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gently held the little girl&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Elliott family also had a warm and welcoming atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, Millie decided to give both Myron and herself a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie lowered her eyes. &#34;It&#39;s just... You know my situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched as Ari let go of her hand and ran off to see the fireworks. In a quiet voice, she said, &#34;Things are complicated on my end, and my health... I may not be able to have more children. Ari might be my only one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about that,&#34; Myron said with a gentle smile. &#34;As long as you&#39;re willing to give me a chance,that&#39;s enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He already understood her circumstances well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they became official, he&#39;d try his best. Who knew what the future might bring?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if there were no more children, they still had Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t fallen for him yet, hadn&#39;t fully accepted him, and their relationship wasn&#39;t set in stone-but the fact that she was willing to try meant everything to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would give his all just to earn a piece of her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Millie said with a nod, glancing toward Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s gaze stayed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fireworks lit up the sky, casting long shadows of the two standing side by side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stood in silence,watching the distant figures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw one of them drift away, searching for something, while the other two remained behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him, Vivian broke the silence. &#34;I heard your grandfather&#39;s here... He&#39;s not well. Did he cause it?&#34; she asked softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon turned to her pale face, unsure how to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian looked back at him, worry written on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, she had made arrangements with her caregiver to stage a scene. She had steeled herself and cut her own wrist just seconds before Brandon arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though it had bled a lot, the cut wasn&#39;t deep. The doctor had stitched it up quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, she already knew exactly how Brandon got injured-because she had been standing nearby, quietly watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s mind was still on Millie-especially after learning that Serena and Millie were the same person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian felt bitter resentment. But she couldn&#39;t go after Millie directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that she had injured herself, this was the moment Brandon would feel the strongest guilt and sympathy for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more understanding she acted, the deeper his guilt would run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian believed that guilt, if used well, could get a woman almost anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that in mind, she reached out again, trying to help him press the ice pack on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he pulled away and said, &#34;I know a mental health facility with good privacy. Want to check it out tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian froze for a moment. Then she realized what he meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mental health retreat? She looked down at her wrist. Was it because of this? But she felt fine-she knew she was fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, and then asked for the name of the facility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he told her, she replied, &#34;Let me think about it. I&#39;ll let you know tomorrow, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave her another look, and then nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, fireworks lit up the open ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three people were still watching nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Brandon felt a sharp pain in his chest. It became hard to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like something important was slipping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly,the fireworks faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw the trio cleaning up the area and leaving. But the pain in his chest wouldn&#39;t go away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day finally came to a close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been full of life, and the excitement spilled into the next morning- because the edited version of Heavenly Melody&#39;s grand finale had just gone live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That morning,Evans Entertainment released a statement to address resurfacing rumors about Serena and Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t people say Serena had a miscarriage because of Charles? Now that Serena is Millie, does that mean there&#39;s something between Millie and Charles?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The statement came as a video recorded by Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There were rumors that Serena lost her baby and that baby was mine; and it all began with a leave note,&#34;Charles explained, holding up the forged medical record.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued, &#34;At that time, Millie was badly injured. Anyone who watched the live show or the edited cut could see it. Those weren&#39;t makeup effects-those bruises were real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He added, &#34;She was so hurt that she couldn&#39;t even leave the hospital, let alone rehearse for the show. But due to a confidentiality agreement, I had to fake a medical record as a leave slip for Serena. That led people to believe we were somehow involved. That&#39;s how the rumor started. Millie and I have worked together since before her marriage to Brandon. Ours is a professional relationship. I hope the rumors will stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the video aired, the online chatter quieted down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reason was simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither Charles nor Vivian wanted things to blow up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles didn&#39;t want Millie&#39;s name dragged through the mud all over again. Vivian, who knew exactly how Millie lost her child, also didn&#39;t want anyone digging too deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,the rumor quickly faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With fresh stories popping up every day, the public&#39;s attention quickly moved on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere,Brandon hadn&#39;t slept all night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thoughts of Millie-both as Millie and Serena-kept running through his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He replayed past moments again and again, feeling more miserable with each one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to reach out and tell her the truth. He wanted to say, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Millie. Please come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he saw a message fromn Vivian in the morning, he held himself back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The swelling on his face had gone down, but Millie&#39;s slaps had left clear marks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d already told Eugene to cancel his morning meetings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked down at the message again.Vivian had agreed to visit the mental health facility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five months, Brandon reminded himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he got up, drove to pick her up, and the two of them headed to the facility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they entered the building, in a nearby office, Rita was on the phone with Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing Millie was moving on and embracing changes in her life brought a sense of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The last few times you came by, I could tell you were getting better,&#34; Rita said, just as she looked up-and saw Brandon wvalk in with Vivian.</p>
