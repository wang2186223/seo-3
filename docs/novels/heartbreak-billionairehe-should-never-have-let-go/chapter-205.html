                <p>Vivian hesitated for only a beat, and then quickly fired off a message to Johnny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he saw it, Johnny leapt into action,spinning the story in every direction at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pointed out that while Vivian never received a scrap of help from the Watson Group, while Millie took the Elliott Group&#39;s backing without a second thought. Was that really fair? Everyone knew Myron had been circling Millie for weeks now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also emphasized that all Vivian wanted was a simple wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And finally, Johnny rallied support for Vivian&#39;s luxury villa floral series project, urging everyone to check out her newest line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this fresh narrative, public opinion flipped on its head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sympathy for Vivian flooded in, and before long, the top comment read, &#34;Millie only gets her moment in the spotlight thanks to Elliott Group&#39;s endorsement.Vivian has made everything herself. Whether it&#39;s Love of Vivian or her new project, these are Vivian&#39;s own creations. What does Millie even have that compares?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Internet exploded into a frenzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie saw Vivian&#39;s tactics unfold with a relaxed,almost amused smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had known Vivian would never let herself be sidelined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville quickly rallied the group, setting the conversation in motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, Millie sent her message. &#34;Our priority is to protect consumers. Buyingis a personal choice-no one should be made to feel guilty about not buying anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville wasted no time, pushing those points hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First, Millie&#39;s collaboration with the Elliott Group was earned fair and square-her win at Heavenly Melody was public information, her hard work visible to all.Every design in the collection and the display had taken real effort; no one could say she hadn&#39;t earned her success. Second, people bought what they liked.No one deserved criticism for making their own decisions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Elliott Group released a statement soon after,making it clear they stood firmly behind their customers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With so many people already having purchased items from the Blue series, the brand&#39;s open support put buyers at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some buyers found themselves suddenly labeled as Millie&#39;s fans and being harassed by haters because of it, which was really annoying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calling me a fan just because I bought something she endorses? That&#39;s absurd. I picked it up because the design was beautiful and I really liked it. I don&#39;t even know who Millie or Vivian is!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Vivian wants a wedding, why can&#39;t they just get married and get it over with? If her family&#39;s against it,they can always tie the knot overseas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most poeople didn&#39;t bother getting involved, choosing to ignore the latest wave of online drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Derek stepped forward to address the mesS.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He posted a video statement. &#34;What I&#39;m offering here is crucial to both parties. The stakes are massive. If it weren&#39;t absolutely necessary, neither Millie nor Vivian would ever agree to this competition.This is about skill-plain and simple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also revealed part of Millie&#39;s contract, making it clear she&#39;d have to pay three times the price to buy back what she wanted if she lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Derek never revealed the complete contract, it was obvious to everyone that anything entered into a match like this had to be priceless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Derek&#39;s intervention, the online furor began to cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midnight came and went, ushering in the next round of voting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the polls opened, the numbers skyrocketed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike yesterday&#39;s landslide in Millie&#39;s favor, this time her votes and Vivian&#39;s raced forward side by side-locked in a dead heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie took in the scene, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was far from an easy opponent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian might be pouring her energy into the &#34;Love of Vivian&#34; project, but everyone knew the real foundation of her reputation was that high-end villa floral design series-the one that had catapulted both her and her brand into the spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But beneath the shine, Millie understood the truth- this luxury line wasn&#39;t a gold mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The potential for profit was limited. After all, only those who actually owned luxury villas could even consider paying for these extravagant designs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was no secret that Vivian&#39;s business had surged years ago thanks to Brandon&#39;s connections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But most affluent clients preferred to keep their personal lives private from the public, and that included the interiors their houses. No one wanted their opulent decor paraded in the media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, with the future uncertain, Millie wondered how long Vivian could keep finding more clients for her signature work. Would Brandon keep opening doors for her, or would that support dryup?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed those thoughts aside. Whatever deals Vivian struck behind closed doors were none of Millie&#39;s business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that mattered was winning, one round at a time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie lingered in her thoughts until her phone buzzed  You Can Eve against the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced down, thumbed it open, and saw Myron&#39;s name flash across the screen. &#34;Don&#39;t be mad.Check this out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath his message was a short video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In it, Myron&#39;s plump ragdoll cat sprawled belly-up on the sofa, all four paws sticking straight in the air-each one balancing a bright yellow rubber duck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cat lay so still, Millie almost mistook it for a plush toy, if not for the subtle twitch of its fluffy tail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, Myron lounged in soft pajamas,quietly squeezing a rubber duck until it gave a squeak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cat hissed indignantly, tail swishing in protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie let out a quiet laugh, the corners of her mouth curving up at the sight of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a smart and charming little cat!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment&#39;s thought, she remarked, &#34;Ari would definitely love this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, after a beat, she added, &#34;Honestly, i kind of love it too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing back at the video, she couldn&#39;t help lingering on the image of Myron-so casual in soft loungewear, a world away from his crisp, businesslike self. The gentle, domestic side of him gave her a warmth she hadn&#39;t expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone buzzed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s message popped up. &#34;I love it too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about his words made her pause, as if there was more beneath the surface-a note she couldn&#39;t quite name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the feeling wash over her, and then set her phone aside and slipped quietly into bed, a small smile lingering on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s irritation over Vivian&#39;s latest antics had faded replaced by a rare sense of calm. She even found herself in the mood to spend time with Myron&#39;s cat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, she drifted into a deep, dreamless sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Brandon sat in a shadowed corner of Blue Lounge, eyes glued to his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him, Darden sipped a drink, still scrolling through the replay of Vivian&#39;s live stream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So this is why you asked me to lend Vivian my villa?Was that for her project?&#34; Darden finally broke the silence, his tone heavy with unspoken judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave a silent nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden exhaled, setting his glass down with a dull thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The more you back Vivian now, the more impossible it&#39;s going to be for you and Millie to patch things up later. You really think this is the right move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t answer right away. He stared into his drink, Myron&#39;s words from the previous night stil ringing in his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drained his glass in one determined swallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian&#39;s getting reckless,&#34; he admitted, his eyes flickering toward the glow of the ceiling light. &#34;But l don&#39;t have a choice. I have to help her. Letting Millie win just isn&#39;t an option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Millie walked away victorious, Derek would hand her the Bennett family inheritance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if that happened, Brandon knew he&#39;d lose the only leverage he had left. She&#39;d leave-without even letting him say what he needed to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But if you keep this up... do you really think you and Millie can ever fix things?&#34; Darden&#39;s words struck right at the center of his tangled thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stayed silent, staring through the rainbow-hued lights overhead, feeling nothing but a heavy grayness inside his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t answer. All he could do was cling,stubbornly, to the one thing he still believed was right.</p>
