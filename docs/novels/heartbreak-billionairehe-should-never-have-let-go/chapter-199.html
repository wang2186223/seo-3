                <p>Since everything was being live-streamed, the moment the clip appeared, a wave of excitement swept through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone who still doubted the mermaid video was a marketing stunt for Elliott Group&#39;s new product had their doubts wiped away. The new naked-eye 3D video made that clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny&#39;s team jumped into action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This promo is nice. But it still doesn&#39;t top the mermaid video,&#34; someone said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; another agreed. &#34;That one was better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The mermaid clip told a love story. This one&#39;s just standard advertising.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads nodded all around. Reporters turned toward Millie. &#34;Honestly, this video feels kind of plain. Have you seen the mermaid one going around online?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This clearly can&#39;t compete with the mermaid video.What&#39;s your plan to fix this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Millie could answer, a flashy red Mercedes screeched to a dramatic stop nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the driver&#39;s seat stepped out a man wearing a smug smile. It was Oakley Evans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked straight toward Millie. The crowd parted for him, sensing something was about to go down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley sneered. &#34;Millie. Or do you prefer Serena?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie met him with a soft smile and a slight nod. &#34;Mr.Evans.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cold stare didn&#39;t budge. &#34;You helping my hot-headed brother with Heavenly Melody gave me quite the headache.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie kept smiling. She said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley stepped closer. &#34;Now that Elliott Group is launching a new product, I&#39;m curious. What trick will you pull next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie lowered her gaze for a moment. Then she looked up and said, &#34;I promise it&#39;ll surprise you, Mr.Evans.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh?&#34; Oakley raised a brow and sized her up.&#34;doubt that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Believe it or not, that&#39;s up to you, Mr. Evans,&#34; Millie replied calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head slightly, and then looked him in the eye, her smile fading just a little. &#34;So, Mr. Evans,did you come here to cause trouble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley let out a laugh. &#34;Exactly. You caught on quick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze turned sharp. &#34;I want to see how you plan to sell those jewels when this promo video flops. I&#39;ll wait for you to come crawling, trashing Charles and begging me. Maybe then f&#39;ll be generous enough to help a little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie only smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked dazzling under the camera&#39;s lens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word to Oakley, she signaled to her team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The paused video resumed. The crowd turned back to the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The party scene continued, and suddenly, the necklace snapped. The gemstone fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As it dropped, the music rose to a soft climax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The necklace shed its outer layers, revealing a pure blue sapphire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sank into the sea, where a little mermaid caught it.She swished her tail, lifted the blue gem, broke the surface, and admired its glow. Then, she turned and saw the prince. The gem in her hand mirrored the deep blue of his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, these two scenes are connected?&#34; someone shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re both part of the Elliott Group campaign!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Millie plan all of this?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reporters spun toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stood still, still smiling-her gaze locked on Oakley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression soured. But he muttered, &#34;Still not that impressive. Nothing special.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie dipped her head slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned to the crowd and said, &#34;Everyone,please follow me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd followed as she walked off, clearing the intersection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They entered Elliott Group&#39;s property.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the road stood another Elliott Group store,also fitted with a large outdoor 3D screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Between the two stores was a short, dead-end road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No cars passed through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the screen on the other side lit up, syncing with the one they had just watched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One side showed a modern party. The other, an underwater world. And the road in the middle-under special lighting-turned into an ocean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow!&#34; gasped the reporters, cameras flashing nonstop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Millie gently shook the bell in her hand.A gemstone-shaped platform rose from the side, lit by soft beams of light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked at the crowd. Holding a gemstone necklace, she walked toward the platform.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she stood at the center, the lights focused on the jewel in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the two screens glowing on either side,the road beneath her shimmered like the sea, She looked like she had stepped into a fairytale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The necklace sparkled brightly, tying the entire scene together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reporters were stunned, broadcasting every second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe this will look even more magical at night,&#34;Millie said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Every piece from our Blue series is specially designed to reflect light. The focused beams bring out its brilliance completely. Just like this one, other pieces will have a similar effect. We&#39;ve arranged with the city to close this road for two hours every night.Everyone&#39;s welcome to come, take photos, and enjoy the view.&#34; Her smile was warm as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the live broadcast still rolling, Millie&#39;s words immediately spread fa and wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two outdoor 3D screens. A glowing visual ocean scene street. A perfect photo spot. It was made for the camera-and people loved it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Especially Millie&#39;s live demonstration-it was simply beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These were mid-range products.Not cheap,but still within reach for many.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the story behind it was also beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Comments online began to explode. &#34;Everything matches-the gem, the ocean, the prince&#39;s eyes.Someone said it best, &#39;The eyes of a lover are the eighth ocean.&#39; That&#39;s what this feels like. So romantic!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Millie spoke again. &#34;Ladies and gentlemen, this is out new Blue series. It stands for serenity, passion,and romance. We invite you all to explore and make a purchase.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right as she finished, Elliott Group&#39;s website released the collection online. Images. Descriptions.Orders began pouring in. People nearby rushed straight into the store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie slowly turned back and looked at Oakley.He didn&#39;t look pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave him a soft smile. &#34;Mr. Evans, what do you think now? Did anything catch your eye?&#34;</p>
