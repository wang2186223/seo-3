                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Brandon blinked, momentarily thrown off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was Eugene talking about? Millie&#39;s medical files?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson, when I went to the archive to get Miss Simpson&#39;s files earlier, I mentioned your name as her emergency contact.&#34; Eugene said. &#34;The clerk at the desk probably made a mistake and also pulled up Miss Bennett&#39;s records.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s brow furrowed as his gaze dropped to the papers in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re telling me. These are Millie&#39;s medical records from her visits here?&#34; he asked slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene exhaled slowly. &#34;I wasn&#39;t certain at first either,&#34; he said with a nod. &#34;But after reviewing the details, there&#39;s no doubt. Miss Bennett began</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..treatment here more than a year ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated, his eyes shifting toward Brandon with a trace of unease. &#34;She&#39;s been seriously ill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon felt as if the world around him had tilted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of it seemed real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached forward and took the stack of documents from Eugene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Eugene stepped back and went to take care of other tasks, leaving Brandon standing alone in the hushed corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon took a deep breath and began flipping through the recordds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The notes weren&#39;t filled with personal accounts. They only charted the steady decline of her health, the treatments attempted, and the medications prescribed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the dates...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His knees felt weak, and he sank into the nearest</p>
                
                
                
                <p>bench, eyes lifting to the sterile white ceiling glowing under fluorescentlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every entry pointed to the same thing-her condition was getting worse each time she came in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the later reports, the doctor had even considered contacting her family despite her constant refusal to involve them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One note stood out. Two months ago, her condition had taken a sharp turn for the worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the exact time when they had been stuck in the court-ordered waiting period before their divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And during those days, she had a few accidents and had been in the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never gone to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then came...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The auction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon shut his eyes, and a sharp ache spread</p>
                
                
                
                <p>through his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he ever fight her over that tanzanite for Vivian&#39;s sake? That was the birthstone she had chosen for their future child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought clawed at him until it was almost unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept reading the medical records, going through them again and again. His hands shook as he gripped the pages tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The notes showed that she had refused the medication at first. Later, she had told the doctor she was willing to take it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The timing lined up exactly with their first trip to the courthouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now he understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After losing the child in Flesta, the grief had carved a wound so deep that neither of them could escape it.They had both longed for another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must have refused the medication because she desperately wanted to conceive a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fists curled, trembling harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was that night when she had finally given up on him completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t even recall the exact words he had thrown at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he did remember was mentioning the divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had looked straight at him and asked, &#34;Does it have to be like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what about me?&#34; she had asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice had stayed steady when she asked again,&#34;Are you sure this is what you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And finally, she had only said, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four short lines. Three of them seeking an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was the last one agreement, or was it surrender?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why hadn&#39;t he seen it then?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he thought back to that night, all he could remember was the heat of their bodies tangled together and the irritation that surged in him when he mentioned divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t realized it was her last attempt to hold on to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her last chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp smell of disinfectant clung to the corridor.His tears struck the pages, one drop after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s grip on the documents shook, the pages quivering in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in his life, he understood what real regret felt like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only he had seen it back then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only he had taken the last chance she had offered him.Would everything be different now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice from that day in the sunflower field still rang in his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, we each have someone we care for now.&#34;&#34;Look ahead. Hold on to the people by your side.&#34;&#34;Stop hurting those who love you like you did to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he could still remember her words from the charity gala, when they had stood together on the terrace garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson, you shouldn&#39;t let your concern reach past your partner, or else you&#39;lI only end up betraying her.&#34; &#34;That kind of thing would only break her heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some people hardly matter, Mr. Watson, but some really do. And if someone important chooses to walk away, you might never get a second chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was him. He was the one who had kept wounding her, over and over, until sadness was all she had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been so broken, and so sick, yet she had told no one. She had tried to treat herself quietly,without drawing attention. Because they had both wanted a child, she had refused to take the medication that could have helped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Vivian had pretended to be depressed just to pull his focus toward her and keep herself from being blamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was brutal-Millie was the one who had been truly ill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that employee in the archive hadn&#39;t made that careless mistake, Brandon would still be in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she was fighting her illness, what had he been doing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter laugh slipped from his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been making it worse for her, adding to the weight she was already carrying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, it was his fault she had fallen ill in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon flipped through the records, searching for the date of her first appointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then he began searching his own memory, trying to pinpoint what had happened during that time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that must have broken her completely driving her to seek help when the symptoms could no longer be ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s thoughts wandered, pulling up memories one after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt as though time itself was moving backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he thought about it, the more he realized she had been pulling away from him little by little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, he could pinpoint the exact moment when something in her had changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes, once filled entirely with him, had begun to lose their light. The warmth had faded, replaced by quiet disappointment. And eventually, she had let go for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been about a year ago. She had come to him holding her phone, saying they needed to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, she sent me a message.&#34; She had been wearing a long white dress that day, her hair smooth and flowing over her shoulders. She looked calm on</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the surface, but her voice carried a faint edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding out her phone, she remarked, &#34;Brandon,I need you to explain this. I&#39;ve been hearing rumors about you and that florist, Vivian. And now she&#39;s messaged me herself. It&#39;s a direct provocation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had barely glanced at the screen before irritation flared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She didn&#39;t need to send you anything. Millie, what&#39;s going on with you lately? You&#39;re always like this. Do you know how exhausting it is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the message she sent me. And you think I&#39;m overreacting?&#34; Her eyes had reddened as she pressed on. &#34;I keep getting messages from her... with photos of you dining together, going out together,and other things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice had grown sharper. &#34;Brandon, my husband is surrounded by gossip, and a woman like that has the nerve to provoke me directly. How am I supposed to just ignore it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, | told you l&#39;ve been busy,&#34; he replied,struggling to keep his temper in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she wouldn&#39;t let him walk away. She wanted an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the time, Brandon had been hearing about Darden&#39;s own mess-how his girlfriend was throwing fits and threatening to harm herself just to get his attention. Darden had complained to him over drinks more than once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when another thought crept into Brandon&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, are you having someone send you those photos and pretending they came from Vivian? Just so you can confront me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, he could still see the color draining from her face in his memory, and the way her eyes filled with disbelief and hurt.</p>
