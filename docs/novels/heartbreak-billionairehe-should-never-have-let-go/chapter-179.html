                <p>At Watson Group headquarters, Brandon pressed his fingers to his temples, his eyes fixed on Vivian acroSS the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s voice was ice-cold as he asked, &#34;What were you thinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian blinked at Brandon, bewildered. What was the problem?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t it her livestream that had supposedly turned things around, saving the company&#39;s stock from total collapse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certain she&#39;d done the Watson Group a favor.She was the reason for the sudden recovery,not Millie or anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All these years, Millie had never wielded this kind of influence. Only Vivian managed to stir up such a dramatic effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she couldn&#39;t say that outright, so she masked herself with a pained, innocent expression. &#34;Brandon,when I saw the Watson Group&#39;s market value nosedive this morning, I thought I had to do something fast to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon&#39;s frosty glare didn&#39;t soften.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene,standing to the side, finally spoke up, unable to stay quiet. &#34;Miss Simpson, you can&#39;t just act on your own. These are major company decisions. You need to coordinate with us first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of irritation crossed Vivian&#39;s face, but she quickly hid it. She&#39;d harbored a grudge against Eugene for ages, and once she secured her place as Brandon&#39;s wife, she fully intended to make him pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, however, she had to play along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I saw the news and just went live without thinking,&#34;Vivian stammered, dropping her gaze and biting her lip.&#34;Anyway,everything turned out fine, didn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene cast a frustrated glance her way. &#34;That&#39;s only because the entire company worked through the night, and Mr. Watson never left the boardroom. We had a plan from the start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian fell silent, her eyes downcast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one seemed to notice the bitterness simmering just beneath her meek facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon, however, never looked away, his cold stare stil locked on Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on him that he&#39;d acted without thinking things through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d grown used to the effortless partnership he shaed with Millie, where every project ran smoothly,their instincts perfectly in sync.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half the time, a single glance or a brief smile was enough for them to understand each other&#39;s thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments like today&#39;s fiasco simply never happened when Millie was around. Because she knew that, when it came to a public company, nothing mattered more than building trust through dependable, high-quality products.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, Watson Group ran flashy ad campaigns and brought on big-name endorsements, but at the end of the day, their technology was their real backbone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon noticed the dissatisfaction in Vivian&#39;s eyes,feeling under pressure. But in the end, he decided to let it slide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian just didn&#39;t get how these things worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,something nagged at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you personally own any Watson Group stock?&#34;Brandon asked, his tone cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh?&#34; Vivian stared,puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene cut in, his voice serious, &#34;Miss Simpson, this is a serious matter. What you did could be viewed as manipulating the stock price, especially if you purchased shares when they were at their lowest...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene trailed off, but the threat was obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This could have major legal consequences,&#34; he added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Depending on the circumstances, she could be facing jail time or at least a hefty fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian shot Eugene a sharp look, but quickly replied,&#34;No, I didn&#39;t buy any shares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t take her at her word. Instead, he looked straight at Eugene. &#34;Double-check it for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; Eugene answered at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, I already told you l didn&#39;t buy any. Don&#39;t you trust me?&#34; Vivian&#39;s voice edged with panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon met her gaze with a chilling calmness,so unlike the man she thought she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The eerie composure in his eyes only made Vivian bristle with frustration. She continued, &#34;You really don&#39;t have to go this far. I said on the livestream that I acted on my own, and you had no idea what I was doing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene let out a weary sigh. &#34;Miss Simpson, do you honestly think anyone will believe that? You&#39;ve brought up your relationship with Mr. Watson on public platforms more than once. The damage is already done, no matter what you say now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; Vivian shot him a glare, her patience fraying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet in the end, she held her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, she threw up her hands in exasperation. &#34;Fine,do whatever you need-I&#39;ll cooperate, all right?!Satisfied?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stormed out of the office, her angger trailing behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene hurried after her, leaving Brandon standing by the window, silently watching her retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Vivian reached the doorway, Brandon spoke,his tone flat. &#34;From now on, Vivian, leave Watson Group matters to me. Don&#39;t get involved ever again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That stung. Vivian stiffened, her back still to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, that&#39;s it? You&#39;re cutting me out?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t bother to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene cut in, hoping to smooth things over, &#34;Miss Simpson, that&#39;s not what Mr. Watson means. The company&#39;s business is complicated, and he&#39;s only looking out for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian stayed silent, her hand tightening on the doorknob, the tension hanging in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, I just want to help you,&#34; she pleaded,turning around, eyes bright with tears. &#34;If she could manage it, then why can&#39;t l? Maybe | made mistakes this time, but I&#39;m still willing to do whatever it takes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t meet Vivian&#39;s gaze. His eyes dropped,voice steady but distant. &#34;Let&#39;s have dinner tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of satisfaction flickered across Vivian&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was how he chose to handle her, by giving in,yet again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear he still didn&#39;t know how to say no to her,so he let things slide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian gathered herself and, without another word,trailed after Eugene to take care of the verification.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon was left alone in the vast CEO&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes wandered to a small table in the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, whenever there was business to sort out,  Millie would claim that spot, settling in with a neat pile of paperwork at her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now it sat empty and silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, the persistent buzz of his phone pulled him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon checked the caller ID and picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon!&#34; Derek&#39;s voice exploded through the line,anger clear. &#34;I put my neck on the line, making calls all night and smoothing things over for you, and this is what I get? You need to get Vivian out of Watson Group,now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One call ended, only to be followed by another. And another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon pressed his fingers to his temples, his gaze lingering on the empty side table nearby, a constant reminder of the mounting pressure he felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Millie had watched the entire livestream unfold with steady composure, and then tracked the wild swings of the Watson Group&#39;s stock price on her screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment&#39;s consideration, she dialed Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up quickly, and Millie got straight to the point. &#34;What&#39;s the latest news?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement charged Charles&#39;s voice. &#34;My contact confirmed it. He used several accounts to scoop up Watson Group shares at rock-bottom prices. The moment he finished, Vivian started her livestream. The timing lines up perfectly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything clicked for Charles at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian and Oakley were definitely working together.They&#39;d crossed paths in private several times even during the show Heavenly Melody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they could catch this ongoing scheme and nail down the evidence, it could finally give Charles the upper hand against Oakley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles could finally deal a significant setback to Oakley!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave a soft laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll need hard evidence,&#34; Millie said, her tone steady. &#34;Charles, track his finances and monitor any linked accounts for suspicious activity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles agreed immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t need to say more. Their unspoken understanding was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They knew that,even with concrete proof of Oakley and Vivian&#39;s collaboration, the punishment would probably amount to littlemore than a fine. Still, it would deal a heavy blow to both their reputations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie never set out to go after someone already on their way out, but the moment she agreed to that wager with Vivian, a clash became unavoidable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truth be told, Vivian had brought all of this on herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, Millie glanced once more at the fluctuating stock chart on her screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her father&#39;s advice drifted through her thoughts.&#34;Millie, until you have the power to make the rules,your job is to follow them and turn them to your advantage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s gaze dropped, her eyes softening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, she found herself missing her father all over again.</p>
