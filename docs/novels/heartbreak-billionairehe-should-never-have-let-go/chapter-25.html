                <p>A sense of mystery hung over the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a handful of people knew the truth, and Vivian had been forced to rely on Brandon&#39;s influence just to dig up the details. Within the company, the matter was locked down as highly confidential.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most employees had simply heard that Serena&#39;s injuries were serious enough to keep her bedridden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles had been the one to champion Serena&#39;s rise.Even though he was just the third Evans son, the Evans family&#39;s reach and power were legendary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held the reins as CEO of Evans Entertainment, a major branch of the Evans Group and one of Crobert&#39;s top three entertainment empires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors circled about his personal life. He had never married or publicly dated anyone. Whenever he lavished attention on a woman, most assumed she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>was someone special, maybe even a secret lover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon listened to Vivian&#39;s theory without showing any opinion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He normally paid little attention to other people&#39;s affairs, yet something about that shadowy figure beside Charles he glimpsed earlier managed to stir his curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he convinced himself it meant nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the dressing room backstage buzzed with activity as Millie finalized last-minute details with staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With so much happening behind the scenes, Charles had been pulled away to handle urgent matters. He might be the company&#39;s CEO, but he couldn&#39;t stay glued to Millie all night. To help out, he had assigned her an assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara Myers, all sharp eyes behind thick glasses and a practical air beneath her cuteness, was a whirlwind of efficiency as she helped Millie prepare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flurry of notes filled her clipboard as she murmured, &#34;Stage is set. Lineup confirmed. Serena you&#39;re third to go on stage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight nod from Millie acknowledged the update.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, she felt the weight of someone&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her eyes, she spotted Vivian at the far end of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian offered a polite smile and a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a blank look, Millie simply regarded her, refusing to engage further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara leaned in and whispered, &#34;Mr. Evans asked me to pass on a warning. Vivian has a powerful,secretive team backing her-not the Watsons. Every move she makes, every word she says, is planned out by her people. Best to steer clear of her unless there&#39;s no choice.&#34; Which, in other words, meant that if confrontation was unavoidable, she&#39;d have to be ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away, Millie gave a silent nod, showing she understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian looked away too, but the moment her eyes shifted, the smile slipped right off her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such boldness for someone who was supposedly nothing more than a man&#39;s secret lover!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet beneath Vivian&#39;s gentle expression, a calculating glimmer flashed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Serena&#39;s position was merely that of a kept woman, Vivian saw potential for her own advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The broadcast kicked off, signaling the start of the live show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three judges took the stage in quick succession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First came two established names in music, both delivering polished introductions and impressive acts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was Vivian&#39;s turn, the energy in the room subtly shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes were drawn to her as she entered beneath the bright stage lights, her white gown shimmering with an almost ethereal glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing the audience, she remarked with confidence,&#34;Good evening, I&#39;m Vivian Simpson, and by trade, I&#39;m a floral designer. It&#39;s an honor to be here tonight.Some of you may be wondering what brought a floral designer to this stage. Many have accused me of chasing publicity. Well, they&#39;re not wrong-Iam!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words, punctuated with a fearless smile, rang out with refreshing honesty.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She directed her gaze straight into the camera, her tone steady. &#34;I want the world to see me-see the ways I&#39;m searching for a new direction, see how it&#39;s possible to shine even when you&#39;re backed into a corner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something about the way her delicate smile paired with her message that tugged at the hearts of those watching, drawing tears from more than a few in the audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her seat backstage, Millie reclined in the lounge, fighting the aches in her body as she quietly took in Vivian&#39;s performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What exactly was it that drew Brandon to Vivian?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be this determined spirit, or was there something about her boldness that echoed who he once was?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People often found themselves moved by others who mirrored the vulnerable versions of their past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sense of care, that impulse to help, was sometimes really about soothing a wound in themselves rather than in another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For men however, these tangled feelings of sympathy could easily become something deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian faced the audience with composure. &#34;I&#39;d like</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to share a song called &#39;Glimmer of Love.&#39; It captures the journey l&#39;ve taken lately. Maybe it will bring hope to anyone else out there who&#39;s had to push through pain to stay strong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a deep, respectful bow, she disappeared as the lights faded to black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of surprise flickered across Millie&#39;s face.&#34;Glimmer of Love?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered titling it &#34;Glimmer of Light&#34; in her original draft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her intent had been for the song to reflect moving on from the past and searching for new possibilities,with the breaking dawn as its central image.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if Vivian wanted a different name, so be it. Their agreement allowed for artistic changes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now the real question was whether the final release would credit both &#34;Eva&#34; and Evans Entertainment as promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The backstage area split into two distinct sections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One space, designed like a small hall, let contestants and judges mingle and chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beyond that, individual private lounges gave each performer a place to retreat and prepare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most people didn&#39;t have time to watch an entire live show, so the producers planned to create a snappier,edited version for online viewers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reactions from various contestants and judges would be needed to round out the final cut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Screens and recording gear dotted both the public hall and private lounges, allowing for both viewing and feedback recording.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of this, however, would go out unedited-production would stitch together the best moments according to their plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recording devices weren&#39;t standard in the dressing rooms, unless someone broke the rule and took it upon themselves to set something up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, Millie relaxed in her private lounge,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara never far from her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A large wall-mounted screen showed Vivian&#39;s performance as it played live on stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Along the screen&#39;s edge, a flurry of comments appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That opening is gorgeous! This whole performance is breathtaking!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why am I already crying? Even those first few seconds leaked online made me tear up-now | can&#39;t stop!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My heart feels too full. I don&#39;t even know which ex I&#39;m supposed to be thinking about right now sobbing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can anyone spare a boyfriend for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s start a waiting list for boyfriend sharing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Count me in. I wouldn&#39;t mind two, if we&#39;re being honest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those 25 seconds have been everywhere lately-background music for every trending video. I thought I&#39;d be sick of it by now, but hearing the full version here makes me cry all over again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, are you glued to the broadcast right now? Still refusing to bow out with a little grace and file for divorce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll say it again! Millie&#39;s twenty-five years mean nothing next to Vivian&#39;s twenty-five seconds!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While online chatter reached a fever pitch, Millie sat comfortably in her private lounge, scrolling through her phone and browsing music apps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had promised the world that &#34;Glimmer of Love&#34; would drop on every major platform the moment she performed it. Verifying the song&#39;s credits would only take a glance. There was no need to dig deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Millie opened the first app, the song</p>
                
                
                
                <p>popped up in a full-screen ad, paired with a sleek photo of Vivian looking perfectly put together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie tapped the screen and read it line by line.&#34;Glimmer of Love. Singer: Vivian Simpson. Lyrics:Vivian Simpson.Composer:Vivian Simpson.&#34;</p>
