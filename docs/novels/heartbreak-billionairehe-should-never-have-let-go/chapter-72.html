                <p>Brandon&#39;s cheek burned where the slap had landed, a mix of rage and humiliation simmering beneath his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not once in nearly three decades had anyone ever dared treat him with such disrespect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat flushed through him as he spun to face her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words hovered on his tongue, but the sight of Millie&#39;s tear-streaked face stopped him cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bathed in silver moonlight, she looked as if she might vanish at any moment-so pale, yet her eyes were raw and swollen with grief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tears spilled quietly, steady as rainfall, soaking his resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every drop cut deeper than words ever could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories from Flesta flooded his mind-the night they lost their baby, the way she had sobbed into his chest, every cry shattering him anew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single sound escaped her lips, yet the ache in his chest was sharp and unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt helpless against the heaviness settling in his heart; witnessing her like that was almost too much to endure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching out, Brandon tried to brush away her tears,only to have his hand knocked aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon.&#34; Her fingers shook as she looked him in the eye,voice unsteady but firm. &#34;I refuse to be seen as someone so despicable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down her cheeks, and she balled her fists so tightly her knuckles blanched, refusing to let herself look small.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You told me Vivian was dying-half a year left,you said-and you wanted to care for her. Fine. You told me you needed a divorce for her sake, and I followed you all the way to the courthouse. Whatever you had with her, I let it go. But how could you belittle me?How could you show such contempt for me and my child?&#34; Millie&#39;s voice barely rose above a whisper, but every syllable rang out beneath the hush of the night.&#34;Brandon, pain isn&#39;t reserved for you and Vivian alone.I made the mistake of loving you, and I will walk away.But what gives you the right to wound me-and my child--like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mouth trembled, her voice faltering on those last words. Nails pressed deep into her skin,trying to anchor her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined not to break, she drew her lips into a stubborn, unyielding line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie.&#34; Brandon&#39;s brow creased with anguish, every sentence landing like a blow. &#34;About Vivian...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He struggled for words, but in the end, nothing came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pale moonlight streamed over everything, cloaking the earth in a cold shimmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Half a year.&#34; The words escaped him at last, heavy and slow. &#34;That&#39;s all the time she&#39;s been given.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hollow laugh slipped from Millie&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her chin, searching the black sky instead of his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did everything unravel like this? Why was he the source of so much pain?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging her sleeve across her face, Millie brushed away the last tears, unwilling to say more, and turned to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand shot out, catching hers before she could escape. &#34;Millie.&#34; Her name left his mouth-hoarse,unwilling to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reply came. She only twisted her arm, determined to free herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he only gripped her tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the moon&#39;s gaze, the red in his eyes matched the stubbornness in his hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie fought his grasp, desperate to be anywhere but here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night breeze cut through her, and suddenly the world began to spin again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wine...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years spent by Brandon&#39;s side at countless functions had made Millie an expert-one sip, and she could judge a drink&#39;s strength without fail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Limits were never a mystery to her, and tonight&#39;s glass shouldn&#39;t have been enough to faze her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long experience with overseas business taught her to stay alert for tampering, and this drink held no hints of anything suspicious.Babette had no motive for such games either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So why As the world tilted around her, she caught sight of Brandon&#39;s fingers circling her delicate wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her health had never truly recovered since that brutal fall on the stairs-since the baby was lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the evening breeze tangled with the alcohol in her veins, leaving her reeling, legs barely able to hold her upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she wanted was to get away from this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to push Brandon off, to free herself from his grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she hadn&#39;t realized how much her balance had slipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie?&#34; Brandon&#39;s brow furrowed in concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No answer came from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he bent and swept her up into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ground vanished beneath Millie as Brandon lifted her, and she tried to shove him away,but her strength had long since faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve had too much to drink.&#34; His voice rumbled low,the sound barely breaking through his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me down,&#34; Millie muttered, her words slurred with fatigue and wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon paid no attention, scooping up her shoes and carrying her toward the villa without missing a step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Branches whispered overhead as they crossed the shadowy path, and Millie&#39;s head spun. She watched moonbeams break through leaves, scattering silver patterns over Brandon&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, the glow blurred past and present,memories blending with the present moment in Millie&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to admit-she was more intoxicated than she thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the door, Brandon pressed his thumb to the scanner. The lock clicked open, and he set her gently at the threshold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned against the wall, steadying herself, while Brandon swung the door shut behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears still streaked her cheeks, and something in her expression left a heaviness in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her, he&#39;d noticed just how much weight she&#39;d lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d always been slight, but now her fragility seemed impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like the wine&#39;s caught up with you. Were you really planning to leave in this state?&#34; Brandon&#39;s voice was gentle but edged with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heading out like this could put her in real danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need your concern,&#34; Millie retorted, her words thick and nasal from crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet sigh escaped Brandon, frustration mingling with resignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Moonlit Estate isn&#39;t exactly teeming with taxis. How do you plan on getting home-on foot?&#34; he asked,trying to reason with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Security meant the area around the estate was always clear of prying eyes, and the Watsons liked it that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, a family driver would be on standby, but Millie seemed intent on making her own way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her clamp her lips together in stubborn silence, he continued, &#34;I spotted your car outside.Were you thinking of getting behind the wheel like this? Millie, you can&#39;t even keep your balance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to answer, tears streaming unchecked down her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough,&#34; Brandon said softly, &#34;don&#39;t cry anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faint glow by the doorway cast shadows over Millie&#39;s tears, each one pulling at Brandon&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned away, refusing to meet his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a weary sigh, he bent down, hands gentle as he cradled her face and wiped the wetness from her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up close, he caught every shimmering drop clinging to her lashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He closed the distance and pressed his lips softly to hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Salt from her tears mixed with the warmth of her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fists landed against him, feeble and unconvincing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring her resistance, Brandon tightened his grip,lifting her easily and carrying her through the hall into the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>White wine lingered on her skin; he didn&#39;t give her a chance to speak, silencing her with another kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want words-only the closeness between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the softly lit room, desire wove around them as he pinned her to the sheets, one hand roaming over every familiar curve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He adored the feel of her, treasured every night spent tangled together, sweet whispers filling the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing compared to the way she trembled in his arms or the look in her eyes when she focused only on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weight had melted off her frame, leaving her even more fragile than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand traced her waist, startled by how much smaller it felt beneath his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A whisper slipped from his lips as he drew her close.&#34;Millie...&#34; He pressed a kiss against her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie.&#34; Again, her name lingered in the hush between them as he found her lips, breath mingling softly wvith hers.</p>
