                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Millie said before ending the call. She quickly freshened up, picked up the original agreement, and rushed out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a taxi and on the way, she called Myron,asking if he could take Ari to kindergarten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything okay?&#34; Myron asked as he stood up to go get Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Derek needs me for something,&#34; Millie explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m on my way to the Watson Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll come pick you up later,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s gaze stayed on the road ahead. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the Watson Group, Derek, Norma,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon and Vivian were all present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each of their faces bore a different countenance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elderly pair looked exhausted, like they&#39;d had no sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek occasionally shot a glare at Brandon, each glance filled with disapproval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon, on the other hand, sat with an air of composure, his face giving away nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian kept her gaze lowered, lost in thought,loosely holding a different phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had claimed her old one was broken, a subtle way of guarding against Brandon taking it from her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, her phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love of Vivian has completed all the procedures needed for its theaterrelease.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>m0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relieved,she leaned back slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The process had begun back during the Heavenly Melody show was still ongoing and had dragged on for quite some time. In that span, she had exhausted various means and leveraged the Watson Group&#39;s connections to push things along more quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that it was complete, a sense of relief washed over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her yesterday&#39;s live stream at Serenity Villa had been exposed as a forced entry, but she hadn&#39;t addressed it, taking her time until she could find a way to turn everything around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she had to give up live streaming, she believed that as long as Love of Vivian sold well, she would still come out on top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, her mood lightened. Earlier today,Derek and Norma had unexpectedly called for both her and Millie. They hadn&#39;t explained the reason yet,but she was sure that since Millie was no longer part of the Watson family, and Derek would never stand</p>
                
                
                
                <p>by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time ticked by slowly. Eventually, Eugene knocked on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Bennett is here,&#34; he announced at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek&#39;s eyes swept over Brandon&#39;s unreadable face before he told Eugene, &#34;Let her in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp click of heels drew closer as Millie stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right away, she sensed the tension in the room,most noticeably from Brandon, whose eyes held a mix of emotions she couldn&#39;t quite read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing not to dwell on it, she greeted Derek and Norma with a polite nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek and Norma looked at each other and sighed deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve called you here today to discuss an issue,&#34;Derek began once Eugene had shut the office door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stayed silent, listening closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We haven&#39;t been feeling well lately, and our energy isn&#39;t what it used to be. So we want to shorten the agreement period. Three months is too long, we&#39;d like to make it two. What do you think?&#34; His gaze shifted from Millie to Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since one month had already passed, cutting it down to two would mean only a month was left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian felt as though fortune was smiling on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Love of Vivian was going to theaters, and soon it could be set for an official release. Vivian also knew Millie was counting on the Elliott Group&#39;s jewelry collection to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to the original schedule the Elliott Group released, three months were required in total. Cutting it short now would mean skipping two rounds of new product launches, which would make it no match for Love of Vivian&#39;s momentum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that in mind, Vivian gave a small nod. &#34;I&#39;m fine</p>
                
                
                
                <p>with that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s brow furrowed as she looked at Derek and Norma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This outcome was actually better than some of the scenarios she had imagined on her way there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the very least, the contest between them wasn&#39;t over yet. It still gave her a path to win back the Bennett family&#39;s possessions through this agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, her approach would need a few careful adjustments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s eyes briefly met Vivian&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching her gaze, Vivian smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, I think it makes sense. They do need proper rest. What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian recalled the trouble she had faced from Charles&#39; people while handling the theater procedures. It seemed Millie really was concerned</p>
                
                
                
                <p>about Love of Vivian making it to the big screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she thought about it, the more certain she became of her advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Derek and Norma shared another look.Their real reason for wanting to shorten the period was to bring this standoff to an end as quickly as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hearing Millie accept Myron&#39;s engagement proposal the previous day, they felt they couldn&#39;t afford to wait any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they should wait two more months, Millie and Myron might even get married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cutting the period by a month was the outcome of careful discussion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The formal agreement was already signed, and any change required everyone&#39;s consent. If they tried to shorten it too much, Millie might reject the proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One month was the furthest they felt they could push without risking her refusal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With just that month left, Millie would have far less time, leaving her no chance to plan the wedding with Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this thought, Derek gave a deliberate, faint cough, making himself appear frail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, what do you think?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked at the elderly couple for a moment before finally giving a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I agree,&#34; Millie said. &#34;But on one condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing events unfold exactly as she&#39;d anticipated,Vivian felt a quiet satisfaction and began, &#34;Millie,you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The condition is that this agreement cannot be altered again after this,&#34; Millie cut in before Vivian could finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Derek coughed slightly, and then called Eugene back into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene returned holding the supplementary</p>
                
                
                
                <p>agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should go over it,&#34; Derek said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie read through it with care. The terms were simple. It was just a mutual consent to modify the timeline, with no hidden clauses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied, she signed her name and then handed it to Vivian for her signature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Millie said, holding the supplementary agreement as her eyes moved to Derek and Norma.&#34;I&#39;ll be on my way now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing more she needed to say to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She only hoped they would take care of themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned to leave, not once glancing at Brandon who was seated nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From start to finish, Brandon stayed silent. He neither opposed the change nor let any emotion show on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept that composure the entire time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when Millie was walking away did he lift his head,his gaze following her retreating figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon,&#34; Vivian&#39;s voice called from beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon drew his eyes back and looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s lips curved into a smile. &#34;There&#39;s now one less mnonth until | officially become part of the Watson family. Does that make you happy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave no reply. Instead, he lifted his gaze to the sky beyond the tall floor-to-ceiling window,watching the clouds drift lazily by, deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian watched Brandon&#39;s profile, her smile deepening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just one month, she would be married to Brandon and bound to him as his wife. And when that day came, he would never be able to break free from her.</p>
