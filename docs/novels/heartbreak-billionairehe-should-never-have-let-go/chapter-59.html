                <p>Brandon made his way across the room to where he had secured the safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers worked the combination with practiced ease, and he retrieved the tanzanite from its velvet-lined interior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the ambient lighting, the precious stone erupted into dazzling brilliance, casting violet-blue fire across his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped mid-motion, his mind churning with uncertainty, and then quickly captured a photograph of the gem and pulled up his chat thread with Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The tanzanite that caught your eye.&#34; He typed carefully, his thumb hovering over the send button.But something held him back, a nagging doubt that crept through his chest. In the end,he erased every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory surfaced wit painful clarity-Millie had desired this particular tanzanite because, should she conceive in March, the anticipated delivery would arrive in late December, making the stone a perfect birthstone match. But the harsh reality crashed over him like a cold wave-they had never conceived a child. Fragments of that pivotal night flooded his consciousness: her radiant smile, the softness of her lips against his, the tiny mole adorning her chest, the intoxicating warmth of her skin against his, and then the heart-wrenching moment when tears of ecstasy streamed down her face as she pushed him away,whispering that she couldn&#39;t continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon set his phone aside and collapsed onto the sofa&#39;s plush cushions, his gaze fixed on the stark whiteness of the ceiling above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What occupied her thoughts at this very moment?With the Internet ablaze with controversy, she had undoubtedly witnessed the chaos. Why hadn&#39;t she broken her silence to contact him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she truly grown wiser, mastering the art of patience and choosing to endure these next six months in quiet dignity? Or perhaps this represented yet another manifestation of her stubborn displeasure?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s eyes drifted to his phone, his mouth forming a rigid line of frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time seemed to dissolve around him, minutes blending into an indistinguishable haze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, he retrieved his phone once more and permanently erased the tanzanite&#39;s photograph he took minutes ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, across the city at the private medical facility, Millie had made her way back to the sanctuary of her designated room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After enduring a grueling and emotionally draining night, she finally experienced a measure of tranquility settling over her weary spirit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles had departed to address pressing corporate matters. Before his exit, he had offered Millie a reassuring promise. &#34;I&#39;m going to force Oakley out of the picture. At the earliest, he&#39;ll be eliminated by the second Heavenly Melody live broadcast-at the very latest, before the third one. His reign of chaos at Evans Entertainment is rapidly approaching its final curtain call!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had voiced her unwavering support for Charles &#39; decisive action without a moment&#39;s hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They now found themselves allied in the same precarious vessel. She had finally seen through Napier&#39;s carefully constructed facade and recognized his true nature. Both she and Charles grasped the fundamental truth that only victory or defeat awaited them. No neutral territory existed in this battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after Charles&#39; departure, Alexia entered the room, cradling a neatly packed food container in her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Millie, you&#39;ve returned so late this evening. You must be absolutely famished.&#34; Alexia&#39;s face brightened with genuine warmth as she extended the container toward her friend. &#34;These dishes are gentle on the stomach, absolutely perfect for a late-night meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia began arranging the various food items before Millie with methodical care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing Alexia&#39;s devoted attentive ministrations,Millie felt a bittersweet ache settle deep within her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could hold anyone accountable for her devastating miscarriage except Alexia. If Alexia hadn&#39;t orchestrated the emergency blood donation arrangements in advance, Millie might have succumbed to catastrophic blood loss. Yet Alexia perpetually shouldered the burden of guilt, carrying it like a stone in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had exhausted countless approaches to alleviate Alexia&#39;s overwhelming remorse, but her efforts had fallen short every time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she permitted Alexia to assist in whatever manner brought her comfort,desperately hoping it might ease the torment weighing on her friend&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve grown so alarmingly thin recently, and it breaks my heart to witness your suffering. You absolutely must nourish yourself properly and rebuild your strength,&#34; Alexia declared, her worry etched clearly across her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie offered a gentle nod and sampled the carefully prepared meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flavors exploded across her palate with remarkable richness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the way, Alexia, where on earth do you and your brotherdiscovertheseextraordinaryculinarycreations?&#34;Millie inquired, her curiosity having festered for weeks.&#34;I questioned Giffard during our last conversation, but he remained mysteriously silent. I remain uncertain whether his silence stemmed from forgetfulness or deliberate evasion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia simply beamed at her with knowing eyes. &#34;Does it satisfy your taste buds?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded enthusiastically, holding nothing back in her praise. &#34;We&#39;ve shared countless childhood memories and dined at some of the most prestigious establishments in the city, but nothing remotely compares to the extraordinary cuisine you two have been delivering to me lately. It&#39;s genuinely transcendent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s expression transformed into one of mischievous delight. &#34;As long as these meals bring you joy!&#34; However, she steadfastly refused to reveal the tantalizing secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie fixed her with a penetrating stare and playfully tapped Alexia&#39;s forehead with her index finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something peculiar is definitely occurring here,&#34;Millie announced with mock accusation. &#34;These dishes don&#39;t originate from any commercial restaurant, do they? Speak truthfully-did your family recently employ a new culinary artist? Are these the chef&#39;s signature specialties?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia shielded her forehead defensively, shot back a withering glare, and formed an exaggerated pout.&#34;Something along those lines, I suppose. Regardless,if you crave more of these meals, I&#39;ll request that he prepare them specifically for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well,&#34; Millie conceded gracefully, allowing the mysterious topic to drift away naturally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They engaged in animated conversation for an extended period.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing Alexia&#39;s endearingly bashful and somewhat clumsy mannerisms, Millie released a profound sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After allowing her thoughts to crystallize for several contemplative moments, she ventured, &#34;Would you consider granting me a personal favor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia responded immediately with an emphatic nod.&#34;Anything for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In just a few days, the second live broadcast of Heavenly Melody will command the stage,&#34; Millie explained, her gaze searching Alexia&#39;s face intently.&#34;Would your schedule permit you to attend and witness my performance on stage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course! I&#39;ll rearrange my entire schedule to be there!&#34; Alexia declared with immediate conviction.Even if prior commitments had existed, she would have negotiated shift exchanges with colleagues to create the necessary time. She added breathlessly,&#34;I&#39;ve been desperately longing to experience the magic firsthand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia then protested with genuine bewilderment.&#34;That hardy qualifies as a favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie reached out and gently poked her friend&#39;s cheek with affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It absolutely constitutes a meaningful favor,&#34; Millie responded, her smile radiating warmth and sincerity.&#34;Nobody else in that audience knows I&#39;m Millie. You alone hold that secret. It transforms the entire experience into something profoundly meaningful-it simply feels extraordinarily special.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie paused and then continued, her voice taking on a more serious tone, &#34;And there exists one additional request.I desperately need your help to find someone and address the audio and video quality issues that have been plaguing the precious live broadcast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witnessing Alexia&#39;s unbridled eagerness and devotion,Millie recognized that she needed to orchestrate something meaningful to finally ease Alexia&#39;s troubled conscience. She refused to allow her dearest friend to remain trapped in perpetual unease, constantly treading carefully around her as if navigating a minefield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They existed as equals in this friendship. Neither person owed the other any debt of gratitude or obligation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Therefore,resolving the live show&#39;s technical audio and video challenges would serve as that transformative &#34;something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Alexia successfully conquered that complex problem, perhaps her lingering guilt would finally dissipate,and their cherished relationship could return to the natural harmony they had shared before tragedy struck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover,Alexia had already secured possession of Tia&#39;s phone. The moment they located a skilled data recovery specialist, every piece of the puzzle would click seamlessly into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps if you immerse yourself more deeply into this project, that persistent issue will reach its resolution sooner?&#34; Millie suggested, her smile carrying both hope and encouragement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re absolutely correct!&#34; Alexia responded with a vigorous nod, her expression radiating newfound determination and unwavering resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that reassuring exchange, Millie felt the tight knot of anxiety in her chest begin to loosen considerably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles could later orchestrate the acquisition of a premium ticket for Alexia to witness the spectacular performance firsthand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time accelerated relentlessly as everyone threw themselves into intensive preparation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the preceding days, Millie had maintained consistent communication with her team&#39;s borilliant mentor,Alex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although their creative visions occasionally collided in passionate disagreement, the resulting artistic friction invariably ignited fresh explosions of innovative inspiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This dynamic collaboration made Millie feel as though they had discovered each other tragically late in their respective careers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alex echoed these sentiments repeatedly with genuine enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he even mentioned that once Millie&#39;s physical condition returned to its former vitality, perhaps they could collaborate on something even more monumentally ambitious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Evans Entertainment, Charles continued his relentless battle against his two scheming brothers,yet simultaneously, he had commissioned a show- stopping performance ensemble for Millie&#39;s upcoming Heavenly Melody live appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The creation was, once again, absolutely breathtaking in its artistic magnificence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Vivian, she had retreated into comparative silence. She proclaimed that she had collapsed from complete exhaustion following all the previous intensive marketing campaigns and desperately required extended recuperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nevertheless, she remained a constant fixture at the Watson Group headquarters, perpetually stationed by Brandon&#39;s side like a devoted shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This conspicuous arrangement even generated sensational headlines on multiple occasions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek, meanwhile, continued nursing his bitter resentment and delivering Brandon the frigid treatment of deliberate indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst all this swirling chaos, the thirteenth day after Brandon and Millie filed for divorce finally arrived with startling swiftness, which coincidentally happened to be the exact date of the second electrifying Heavenly Melody live broadcast.</p>
