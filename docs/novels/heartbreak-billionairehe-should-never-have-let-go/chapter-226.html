                <p>At Serenity Villa, Vivian gently placed the vase on the table. The live camera followed her every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The master bedroom appeared on screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunlight poured in through large windows, bathing the room in a soft glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Open wardrobes lined the wall, filled only with cool-toned men&#39;s suits. Not a single item of women&#39;s clothing could be seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the empty space beside the suits hinted that someone else&#39;s clothes had once been there-now gone without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A double bed stood against the wall, plush and inviting. Everyone watching knew this was where Millie and Brandon used to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside the bed sat a nightstand, and on it, a bottle of perfume.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian walked over, vase in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe I&#39;ll put it here,&#34; she said quietly, as though she truly cared where the flowers should go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her assistant quickly stepped forward, camera ready, and began snapping photos of the nightstand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chanel No. 5,&#34; Vivian said softly, lifting the bottle and spraying it on herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had taken Millie&#39;s husband. Now she wore Millie&#39;s perfume. And soon-she would lie in Millie&#39;s bed with Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As these thoughts crossed her mind, something caught her eye. The top drawer of the nightstand was slightly ajar, like someone had opened it in a hurry and left it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This visit was unannounced. Her team had unlocked the door beforehand so Brandon couldn&#39;t change the passcode, but no one had checked the nightstand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s this?&#34; she muttered, catching her assistant&#39;s attention. He pointed the camera at the drawer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Urged on by the flood of live comments, Vivian pulled the drawer open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The camera zoomed in, showing everything inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only a single sheet of paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On it, a handwritten message read, &#34;The wedding ring is here, and goodbye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s name was signed below, along with a date-almost two months from now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the note Brandon had never seen, the one waiting quietly in the drawer the day he coughed up blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint ring mark still lingered on the paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The livestream exploded with comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The note made it clear-Millie had left with a clean break. No drama. No second thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One comment floated to the top. &#34;I don&#39;t know why, but this room and that note make me feel a little sad.It&#39;s like watching love fade away right before my eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian didn&#39;t check the comments. Her focus had shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her wedding ring?&#34; she muttered under her breath. She placed the note and the perfume on the table and leaned in. &#34;Where&#39;s the ring?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wicked idea sparked-what if she wore Millie&#39;s ring just to provoke her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the drawer was empty. Only the note remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian shut it and reached for the next drawer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a loud bang echoed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door flew open, crashing into the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian spun around. The camera followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene and Darden stormed in with a group behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene acted fast. He spotted the camera and yanked the broadcasting gear. The live feed then cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audience saw a final shaky glimpse-Eugene&#39;s face, a blurry screen, and then a freeze-frame of the note and perfume on the nightstand before everything went dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that same moment, over at Elliott Group, Millie was already leaving the scene as Vivian entered the master bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had reached out to Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was waiting not far off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The live camera followed her steps, the frame trembling slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind Myron stretched a golden river and a sea of sunflowers that swayed in the breeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there, smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Millie reached the platform.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The third venue turned out to be a cleverly disguised counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right where the photo booth stood, Myron waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an open space. A crowd had gathered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re here,&#34; Myron said, extending his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie placed hers gently into his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she replied softly, stepping up with his support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside them, the Polaraid was ready. At that same second, the echo of a door slamming at Serenity Villa rippled through theair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Myron leaned in and kissed Millie-right there in front of the live audience and the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The camera captured it perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the exact moment, Vivian&#39;s frozen livestream stilI showed Millie&#39;s note from months ago. &#34;The wedding ring is here, and goodbye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two scenes side by side hit like thunder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some people in the crowd were watching thelive feed too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them even screamed in excitement. But their scream was swallowed by a louder sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A helicopter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The roar of spinning blades shook the air. Sunflowers bent in waves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A massive wedding photo frame shimmered under the golden light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A helicopter was landing on the rooftop across from the field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Comments exploded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God, it&#39;s Brandon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He came by helicopter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd went wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wind tousled Brandon&#39;s hair as he stepped off the aircraft. He looked across the field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie and Myron had just broken their kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Brandon stared at.them from afar. He locked eyes with Myron. For a moment, they simply looked at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Brandon turned and disappeared from the rooftop. He appeared seconds later in the glass elevator,descending quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze never left Millie. But Millie never turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She faced the camera, photo in hand, and calmly walked to the empty frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lens followed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped the photo into place and turned to the camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is what I brought to the third venue. The first two were the past. This one is the present,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On screen, people were moving aside for her naturally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled and tightened her grip on Myron&#39;s hand. &#34;I&#39;ve stepped out of the shadows. And I have something to share,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked up at Myron. He smiled back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re together. Millie is now my girlfriend,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s stream was still frozen on Millie&#39;s note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind Millie&#39;s live camera, Brandon stood in the space the crowd had cleared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was their official announcement-not just words, but a public declaration. The same way she had once announced her divorce with Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunlight washed over everything. Both Millie&#39;s and Myron&#39;s smiles glowed with happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it wasn&#39;t the end. Something more was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange feeling crept over Brandon. He suddenly felt afraid-and terribly so.</p>
