                <p>From his seat among the special guests, Brandon kept his eyes on the woman performing, but his thoughts wandered to memories from long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The journey of turning Wason Group into a leader in high-tech industry had not come easily,especially moving away from old business models.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One particular night from the past stood out,when he finally decided to make the change-fully aware that the road ahead would be full of challenges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, Millie had stood beside him during those difficult tmes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the year, the two of them bounced from one city to the next, sometimes even crossing borders into different countries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could not forget that one winter they landed in Eldoria for a big negotiation, only to realize they had walked right into a dangerous trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They barely got away, forced to escape by taking a boat out to sea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That winter had been brutally cold, the ocean unforgiving and the small boat tossing about on the  waves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They found the ship&#39;s conditions nearly unbearable yet couldn&#39;t really complain since they were running for their lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no cell phone signal so far from shore, and every minute left them guessing what would happen next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For twelve long hours, they had no one but each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold air filled the cramped cabin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of them layered on every bit of clothing and every blanket, yet the chill kept seeping in as they huddled together, shivering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He noticed her lips starting to turn a pale purple hue from the cold, and he knew he looked just as bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest was tight with frustration-he was furious for being careless, furious at his own weakness, and worst of all, for putting her in danger too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed to sense what he was feeling. Quietly,she reached out and took his hands in hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small voice broke the silence. &#34;Brandon, I&#39;m freezing,&#34;she whispered, pulling him out of his worries. &#34;Are you cold too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He met her eyes and gave a silent nod. She understood him better than anyone. She never tried to offer empty comfort. Instead,she shifted his mind away from his fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He realized, too, that if they made it toland,they would be safe. But if the weather got worse, there was a real chance they would never be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The endless waiting, the constant suspicion,and the swirling anxiety all felt almost too much to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, she managed to smile and leaned closer.&#34;Hold me, will you?&#34; She continued, &#34;If we stay close,maybe we&#39;ll feel a bit warmer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He responded right away, gathering her into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside their tiny cabin, snow drifted over the restless sea. Winter pressed in, with seagulls flying past and their calls echoing through the chilly air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beyond the small window, the world appeared in shades of cold gray and blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, they pressed together beneath a blanket as the boat rocked, finding comfort in each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her scent stayed with him-he could still remember the soft fragrance of her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fit perfectly in his arms, small and delicate,but her presence made him feel steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their heartbeats seemed to fall into the same gentle rhythm, and for a while,the cold faded away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He placed a gentle kiss on her forehead and whispered,&#34;We&#39;re going to make it through this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soft words spilled from her lips, soothing his worries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the live show, Adriana&#39;s eyes shimmered with unshed tears. Jayceon had already started sniffling,dabbing at his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adriana gave him a light smack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you quit whining already?&#34; she muttered to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon&#39;s voice wobbled as he protested,&#34;I can&#39;t help it! It&#39;s just so moving. Please don&#39;t hit me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adriana shot him a look. &#34;I only tapped your shoulder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh...I thought you were actually hitting me,&#34;Jayceon murmured, his voice still shaky with tears. &#34;I heard every contestant tonight is singing something they wrote themselves. Their mentors step in to help,but this show really depends on the performers&#39; own music.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his voice and asked, &#34;What must she have gone through to write a song like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon caught Jayceon&#39;s words. His eyes stayed fixed on the woman singing under the stage lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of her debut performance in the show flashed through his mind, along with their confrontation at the charity gala.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truly, how many battles must a woman face before she could rise to this kind of strength?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She presented herself as strong and completely self-reliant,never showing a need for help, always handling everything alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some reason, that independence only made people care about her even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gentle rock elements of her music took away some of the sorrow. Maybe, like her, the music reflected a calm acceptance after a lifetime of struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice never rose into dramatic cries, but her song could keep listeners awake long into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon turned his attention to Charles, who stood near the edge of the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Charles been the one to guide Serena this far?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room stayed dim, the lighting cool and subdued.While the audience was caught up in the music, Vivian quietly slipped away from the cameras, heading out to the hall to send messages as &#34;V.&#34; She sent a message, saying, &#34;Didn&#39;t you say Serena couldn&#39;t stand up to Napier? How is she still showing up here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blade Joker replied, &#34;Who knows what she said to him at the villa that night! When we got back home, the old man didn&#39;t really address me, but he did say he was done interfering in our affairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>V&#39;s response was quick and sharp. &#34;So what do we do now? I can&#39;t let go of what happened at that charity auction!”&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blade Joker responded, &#34;Charles hasn&#39;t completely shut me out yet. I&#39;ll see if I can convince my oldest brother to step in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>V asked, &#34;And you honestly think he&#39;ll take your side?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blade Joker answered, &#34;I&#39;ll give it a shot. Out of the three of us, he&#39;s always been the sharpest,staying out of my fights with Charles and watching from the sidelines. He isn&#39;t stupid. If things change, he&#39;ll make the choice that benefits him. Just trust me, I&#39;m with you.I respect how determined you are-when you set your sights on something, you go after it. The way you get there doesn&#39;t matter, only that you succeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>V asked, &#34;What about today? Did you manage to mess up her audio and video?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blade Joker reassured her, saying, &#34;Relax. Everything&#39;s under control.&#34; Vivian read the messages and finally allowed herself to breathe easier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze drifted to the camera gear nearby, a wave of emotion rushing over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dealing with Serena had become a constant irritation for her-she nearly lost sight of her original plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still had evidence about Serena&#39;s miscarriage, and with the added scandal about the fake donation, it would be easy to bring Serena down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that in mind, Vivian stepped out of the hallway and slipped back into the backstage lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She settled onto the sofa, gently dabbing at her eyes while glancing over at the cameras.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host noticed her and hurried over, trying to offer some comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian shook her head, putting on a brave face. &#34;I&#39;m just really moved by this performance. It brought back so many memories. Serena is truly amazing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alex, who sat a little distance away, looked at her in shock. Was Vivian really praising Serena?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host wanted to ask more, but Vivian simply fell silent, watching the show through her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind the scenes, she was plotting to knock Serena down while using her as fuel for more drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how impressive Serena seemed, Vivian would always treat her as a stepping stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The higher Serena rose, the safer Vivian felt about her own position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She only had to wait for the right moment to reveal the evidence and ruin Serena&#39;s reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wiping her tears once more, she put on that familiar mix of gentle sadness and fierce ambition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Serena ended her song, still hidden behind her mask, Vivian was the very first to start applauding.</p>
