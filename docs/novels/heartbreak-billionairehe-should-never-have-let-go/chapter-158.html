                <p>No one paid much attention to Vivian. Everyone else seemed genuinely happy. Most of the crowd had gathered around Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sponsor reps and contestants all chatted warmly. Since they worked in the same industry, there was a chance they&#39;d collaborate someday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Serena revealed her true identity, there had been a private discussion among these reps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier,before the final round-when Serena was under fire-a meeting had been held at the Evans family&#39;s estate. Representatives from both the Watson Group and the Elliott Group had come to support her, leaving the others confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, they didn&#39;t know everything. But now, the truth had come to light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena was Millie all along, which was probably why both the Watson Group and the Elliott Group stood up for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the business partners turned to Myron and asked, &#34;Mr. Elliott, at the Evans estate that day, did you let your brother go and show support of Serena because you already knew her true identity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron smiled but gave no direct answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He simply said, &#34;The Elliott Group values Serena for her talent, her potential, and the returns she brings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man nodded, understanding at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were all businesspeople. Even if Serena was really Millie, she remained Brandon&#39;s wife, and that had little to do with Elliott Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At most, it was just about Jayceon being a fan. But what truly mattered was Serena&#39;s talent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone accepted that and moved on to mingle with others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, guests began leaving one by one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, a huge crowd had formed. Many were fans of the contestants, but even more had come hoping to see Millie and Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The media wasn&#39;t far behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With both Brandon&#39;s wife and his rumored mistress appearing on the same show, it was a media goldmine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given the online buzz, every outlet wanted to jump on the story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,the moment Millie stepped out, people rushed toward her like a tidal wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Microphones filled the air as reporters fired questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you wear a mask during the competition?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you think when you found out Vivian was a judge?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that you&#39;ve won, what are your plans going forward?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashbulbs from their cameras lit up the night like fireworks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39; security team quickly surrounded Millie, carving out a space for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie, calm and composed, answered a few questions. She avoided anything about Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said with a smile, &#34;The mask was a decision made together with Evans Entertainment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added, &#34;Winning Heavenly Melody was only possible because of the love and support from everyone-those here and those watching from home. Thank you all so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she bowed deeply before the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As for what comes next, I&#39;ll discuss my future plans with Evans Entertainment. I hope you&#39;ll all keep supporting me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, she ignored every question about Vivian or Brandon and headed straight for the SUV, protected by the guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before the vehicle pulled away, a loud voice rang out. &#34;Vivian&#39;s out! Surround her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie watched as the crowd swerved toward Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara&#39;s face lit up with glee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s been attacking us online for weeks. Let&#39;s see how she handles the heat now!&#34; she said, clearly enjoying the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie wasn&#39;t so sure it would be that easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was a pro at managing her image. How she&#39;d spin this mess was yet to be seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the crowd surrounding Vivian, angry voices began to rise. &#34;How can you destroy someone&#39;s marriage and bully the wife? You&#39;re disgusting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right! Answer us! You&#39;re not walking away this time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak up! Apologize, Vivian!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more polished Vivian&#39;s public image had been, the harsher the backlash now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many who once supported her now felt deeply betrayed. Their anger ran deeper than that of her critics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, Vivian still had loyal fans online who believed she was innocent. But none of them were there tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who showed up had come to vent their rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is just too satisfying!&#34; Barbara laughed, pumping her fist. &#34;She had it coming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The SUV dipped slightly as Charles climbed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara kept peeking out the window, watching the chaos unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie found this a little amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Close the door. If we linger too long, it&#39;ll get too crowded,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara hesitated but finally shut the door after one last look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The SUV rolled forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before they turned the corner, Millie glanced back at the crowd still swarming Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles noticed. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie shook her head, &#34;Just curious how she&#39;ll handle this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles let out a loud laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget her. Let&#39;s go celebrate. We&#39;ve earned it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds good,&#34; Millie replied. But this time, she wasn&#39;t going to the Blue Lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no intention of bumping into Darden or Brandon again and getting dragged into another scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that the dust had settled with the show, she could finally focus on new projects-the Bennett famnily lawsuits, and Ari&#39;s health.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari&#39;s surgery application had already been submitted. The operation could be scheduled any day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just thinking of Ari&#39;s chubby little face brought a soft smile to Millie&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter filled the car as they headed to the celebration. Meanwhile, outside the Heavenly Melody recording venue, Vivian faced the angry crowd alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many who felt betrayed pointed fingers and shouted harsh words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reporters shoved microphones at her, refusing to back off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are claims you got involved in Brandon and Millie&#39;s marriage. What do you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you target Serena-who&#39;s actually Millie-on purpose?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly is yourrelationship with Brandon? Did you interfere in his marriage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each question was sharper than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian wanted to leave, but the crowd hemmed her in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, she burned with frustration. But on the outside, she looked delicate, eyes turning red as she whispered, &#34;I didn&#39;t know Serena was Millie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears rolled down her cheeks, making her look helpless. &#34;And I&#39;m not a home-wrecker,&#34; she added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But someone in the crowd yelled, &#34;We&#39;re not Brandon! Save your tears! Stop playing the victimn!&#34;</p>
