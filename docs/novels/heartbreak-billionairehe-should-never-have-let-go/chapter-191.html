                <p>After repeating the words several times, Brandon suddenly seemed to find strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wiped the tears from his face, as if reaching a decision. Then he started the car and drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At home, Millie sat alone on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had overheard Brandon&#39;s conversation with Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she had already stepped inside like Myron suggested, she sneaked out later and watched them from a distance, worried a confrontation might break out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone vibrated, puling her out of her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced down. Charles was calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment&#39;s hesitation, she answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles asked about her date night with Myron, and she didn&#39;t hold back. She told him about the agreement she had with Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, are you thinking of being with him?&#34; Charles asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; Millie said, her gaze resting on the lamp beside her. &#34;We&#39;ve only just started talking. It&#39;s too soon to tell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie...&#34; Charles said her name, but then fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, he asked, &#34;We&#39;re still friends, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; she replied with a small nod. &#34;We have been for a long timne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. I was afraid you&#39;d leave me behind if you ended up with Myron and focus on your new relationship.&#34; Charles sounded relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would that happen?&#34; Millie gave a soft laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the call ended, Charles stared at his phone in silence. Then, slowly, he smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had always been close friends and business partners. That wasn&#39;t going to change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Millie received another call. This time it was Alexia. She gave her friend the same explanation she gave Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the calls were over, she went to freshen up.Then she turned her thoughts to the Elliott Group&#39;s latest product launches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Vivian sat fuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t Charles enough for her? Now she&#39;s dragging Myron in too, just to go against me?&#34; She scoffed.&#34;Not happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was too busy dealing with Eva for now. Once that was done, Millie would have no place left to stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian already had a plan. That thought made her feel better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the online chatter kept growing, she reached out to Johnny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, a new topic began trending:#MillieMyronAffair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The post tied together Jayceon&#39;s presence in each Heavenly Melody&#39;s live stage, Elliott Group&#39;s last minute sponsorship, and suspicions of insider trading. It hinted that Millie and Myron went a long way back and the Elliott family might be pulling strings behind Serena&#39;s success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rumor spread quickly, fueled by Johnny&#39;s team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as the discussion was gaining traction,Myron made a public statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no affair. No insider trading. My brother Jayceon is just a regular fan. And Serena&#39;s performance on Heavenly Melody truly impressed me. I only approached Millie after her divorce. I&#39;m pursuing Millie now, but she hasn&#39;t agreed to be with me yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Myron speaking up himself, the rumors lost momentum almost instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People&#39;s attention shifted.He hadn&#39;t succeeded yet?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard he was chasing some mystery woman.Now it makes sense&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it&#39;s Millie? And she hasn&#39;t said yes yet? Poor guy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The timeline fits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After watching Serena on Heavenly Melody, I get it.Anyone would fall for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one questioned the timing or mentioned insider trading again. The audience still remembered the backlash Serena faced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her win had come from talent alone. No one doubted that anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now I want to rewatch Heavenly Melody. It hasn&#39;t been that long, has it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me too. I&#39;ll keep an eye out for any scenes with Myron this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, just past 11 p.m., Brandon arrived at Moonlit Estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He parked quietly and walked toward the house where his grandparents lived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had asked him to come earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he arrived, Derek looked like he wanted to say something. But after seeing Brandon&#39;s expression,he held back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of scolding him, Derek simply exchanged a look with Norma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long silence, Derek finally asked, &#34;What was the news? Is any of it true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stood still, calm and composed. It was hard to believe he had broken down just hours before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myron is pursuing her,&#34; he said in a steady voice.&#34;But I think they&#39;re simply working together. They want to win this bet and help her reclaim the Bennett assets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek glanced at Norma. She looked thoughtful. &#34;Is that how it is?&#34; she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed to them Myron was taking this seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Brandon replied, his voice even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it. Good night, Grandpa. Good night,Grandma,&#34; he said politely. Then he turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he stepped outside, something dripped down from his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached up. His nose was bleeding. He blamed the dry air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But a moment later, his vision dimmed. Everything went black and he collapsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grandparents rushed to call their family doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After examining him, the doctor said, &#34;He&#39;s just exhausted. He needs rest and proper care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek and Norma exchanged a long, heavy look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun rose quickly the next day, and time moved on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two quiet days passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That morning, Millie took Ari for her final check-up before the surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari had already been admitted to the hospital two days earlier. If everything came back fine after today&#39;s exam, they could schedule a surgery for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari looked anxious. Her small hands were tightly clenched. She kept glancing up at Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be scared,&#34; Millie said, crouching to meet her eyes. &#34;I&#39;ll be right outside, waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; wish I could be like the other kids. Healthy and happy,&#34; she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her biological parents had abandoned her because of her illness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie pulled her into a gentle hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Giffard walked over and crouched beside them,smiling warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, Ari. It will be over before you know it,&#34;he said, patting her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Hussain,&#34; Ari greeted him with a nervous smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giffard nodded to both of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that afternoon, it was time for the operation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie walked Ari to the entrance of the operating room and stayed there. Giffard gave her a reassuring nod. Millie managed a small, tense smile and waited quietly outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, a black Maybach rolled to a stop outside Crobert Federal Penitentiary. Once it parked,Brandon stepped out.</p>
