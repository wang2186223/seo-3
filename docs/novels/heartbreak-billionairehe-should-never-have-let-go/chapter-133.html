                <p>Chapter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giffard echoed the sentiment. &#34;Congratulations to you, Millie, on reclaiming your independence! Good riddance to dead weight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheridan also added his heartfelt support, saying,&#34;This is truly magnificent! At last, all your suffering has reached its end. Congratulations,Millie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles continued with growing excitement, &#34;Let&#39;s gather for dinner tonight. I&#39;ll secure our reservations!Such a momentous occasion deserves a fitting celebration!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie absorbed her friends&#39; heartfelt congratulatory messages, feeling genuine warmth spreading through her chest, and typed several grateful responses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some time passed, she set her phone aside and prepared to drive away from the courthouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, at that exact moment, she noticed a familiar figure positioned beside her vehicle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t determine how long he had maintained his vigil there, but when he observed her glancing upward, he raised his hand to signal her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure turned out to be Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What possible reason could he have for lingering beside her car?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie found his presence peculiar and unsettling.She reflected on their history; beyond their previous confrontations in the competitive corporate world,she maintained virtually no personal relationship with Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even their business interactions had occurred while she represented Brandon&#39;s interests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beyond her existence as Millie, another identity that had crossed paths with him was Serena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Serena maintained her anonymity behind a mask, and Myron had attended the live performance solely because of his siblings&#39; involvement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These rapid-fire thoughts blazed through her consciousness in a single heartbeat before she lowered her car window and offered Myron a carefully composed smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Elliott, is there something specific you require assistance with?&#34; Millie inquired with practiced politeness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron observed Millie&#39;s seemingly clueless expression and discovered it rather entertaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Care to have a conversation?&#34; Myron suggested with a casual chuckle thatdidn&#39;t quite reach his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie remained uncertain about Myron&#39;s true intentions behind this unexpected encounter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout Crobert&#39;s sophisticated social landscape, three enormously influential families wielded unprecedented power-the Watsons, the  Evans, and the Elliotts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Watson dynasty, commanded by Brandon&#39;s iron fist, had undergone a complete strategic metamorphosis that enabled them to systematically outmaneuver their two primary rivals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Evans empire and the Elliott corporation remained locked in an intensely competitive struggle for second place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, these two powerful dynasties had adopted completely contrasting philosophies when grooming their future leaders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Evans household embraced a ruthless competitive framework, with Charles and his brothers engaging in fierce, relentless battles to determine the ultimate successor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Elliott dynasty, in stark contrast, had orchestrated their three siblings to collaborate harmoniously while expanding and fortifying the Elliott Group&#39;s foundations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Millie understood that the surface dynamics masked far more complex undercurrents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Jayceon projected an image of guileless simplicity, his birth into such rarefied social strata meant he could never truly remain naive about the world&#39;s darker machinations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Elliott empire, which specialized in precious gemstones and exclusive luxury merchandise,wielded considerable influence throughout Crobert&#39;s business landscape. As heirs to this legacy, both Adriana and Jayceon possessed formidable capabilities that commanded respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone capable of compelling both Jayceon_ and Adriana to demonstrate such unwavering deference must possess power that demanded serious consideration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Traditionally,Elliott family matters received resolution through Jayceon and Adriana&#39;s combined efforts,while Myron maintained an almost enigmatic presence in the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The business community knew only scattered details about him-his twenty-nine years of life, his extended period roaming abroad, and his recent return to assume direct control of the Elliott Group&#39;s operations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weighing these intricate considerations, Millie concluded that gathering intelligence should take priority and responded, &#34;Perhaps we could arrange this for another occasion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s enigmatic smile remained firmly in place as he countered, &#34;Would you be willing to spare just a few precious moments for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He allowed a deliberate pause to settle between them before adding, &#34;Millie, or perhaps I should address you as Serena?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s cheerful expression crystallized into momentary stillness before she expertly restored her composed facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Elliott, you must be mistaken,&#34; Millie responded with practiced grace. &#34;Although I&#39;ve indeed heard  whispers recently about this Serena-she seems to have quite remarkable vocal talents?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron declined her deflection with a gentle shake of his head, his smile never wavering. &#34;There exists no confusion whatsoever. From the moment I accompanied Jayceon to that particular event and saw your performance, I&#39;ve been aware of your true identity.Subsequently, I invested considerable effort into thorough investigation, and during the third live show, I attended once more to solidify my conclusions.Do I have to continue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued to regard her with that same disarming smile,radiating an aura of effortless sophistication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Millie refused to underestimate the danger he represented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His ability to articulate such precise details served as irrefutable proof that he had indeed confirmed her carefully guarded secret identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie recognized that avoiding this conversation today would prove impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered a resigned nod. &#34;Very well then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s continue our discussion over coffee,&#34; Myron suggested with refined politeness. &#34;I happen to know a nice place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie acknowledged his proposal,emerged from her vehicle, and followed Myron toward a nearby coffeehouse that exuded both seclusion and sophisticated elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning,Mr.Elliott.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Elliott, what a pleasant surprise!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrons throughout the establishment offered.Myron warm,respectful greetings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their recognition of his presence was unmistakably evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron responded to their acknowledgments with gracious nods of appreciation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie, her mind buzzing with countless questions,trailed silently behind Myron&#39;s confident stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, the pair arrived at an impeccably appointed private chamber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After their carefully selected coffees had been expertly served, the chamber door closed with a soft,decisive click.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Elliott, what sparked this sudden fascination with my affairs? And what motivated you to conduct such thorough investigations into my background?&#34;The coffee&#39;s rich fragrance permeated the intimate space,delicate steam spiraling upward as Millie fixed her gaze on Myron and posed her pointed inquiry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron refrained from providing an immediate response, instead savoring a contemplative sip of his expertly prepared coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our paths have crossed on numerous occasions,though you consistently remained positioned at Brandon&#39;s side during those encounters,&#34; Myron observed with measured deliberation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie confirmed his observation with a subtle nod.That assessment was undeniably accurate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed forward with his explanation. &#34;I always believed Brandon possessed extraordinary fortune in securing your devotion. I must confess... I consistently harbored envy toward him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie studied his expression intently, struggling to decipher the deeper meaning behind his unexpected confession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; also attended that prestigious charity auction,&#34;Myron continued with growing intensity. &#34;That evening, Serena&#39;s masterful technique in escalating the bidding war represented a brilliant demonstration of strategic thinking, which immediately captured my intense curiosity. However, when I learned that Serena was reportedly Charles&#39; romantic partner, l experienced genuine disappointment but chose not to pursue the matter further until Jayceon convinced me to witness Serena&#39;s live performance. Her performance revealed certain inconsistencies that troubled me, and subsequently, as I just explained, I did some digging and then confirmed your carefully concealed identity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So the charity auction had served as the catalyst for his investigation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie lowered her gaze slightly, processing this revelation with growing unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what specific purpose brought you to seek me out today, Mr. Elliott?&#34; she inquired with cautious directness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, simply address me as Myron,&#34; he responded, his smile radiating unexpected warmth.&#34;First, allow me to offer my/sincere congratulations on your successful divorce proceedings. And secondly, would you consider accepting my proposal of marriage?&#34;</p>
