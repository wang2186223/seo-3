                <p>No sooner had anyone stepped out than a wave of reporters surged forward, closing in on the mansion&#39;s front steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bright flashes fired off relentlessly, and the noise from the shouting crowd made it almost impossible to think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Microphones thrust forward, and voices competed for attention. &#34;Can you share what just happened in there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Other reporters shouted over the din, &#34;We could hear cheers from all the way outside! What&#39;s the story with the drones and fireworks? Please give us some details!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions came from every direction. &#34;Excuse me,one more question...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guests barely had time to get their bearings before they were boxed in by journalists desperate for any scrap of new information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most faces showed confusion, even among those who expected a little media attention; no one could have predicted such a mob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Costumes of every color filled the scene, and someone even brought along a barking dog,which seemed just as interested as the press. The animal&#39;s barking grew louder every time someone glanced its way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camera flashes bathed the entryway in white light,turning night into day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was exactly what greeted Millie and Charles as they emerged from the mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise widened Millie&#39;s eyes, hidden just behind her mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She barely had a moment to process before a wave of reporters pressed in, some actually brandishing the dog as part of the spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chorus of barking met Millie&#39;s startled gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cries rang out. &#34;That&#39;s Serena Ellsworth!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Serena, can you share what just took place inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Mr. Evans, your family&#39;s charity auction seems to have sparked quite the uproar. What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flood of questions and people was unending.Charles set his jaw, gently shouldering his way through the mass to shield Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitating, he pulled out his phone and tried to contact security.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, new protocols had been set in motion. Extra guards were already on their way, summoned from nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, reinforcements hit a wall-crowds blocked every route before they could even get close</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every inch of hillside around the mansion had become a trap, with reporters forming an impenetrable ring</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking in the crush of bodies, Charles could hardlly contain his exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He barked into his phone, urgency in every syllable &#34;Send the helicopter, now! The rooftop&#39;s big enough to land on. Just get it here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the while, he kept Millie behind him, acting as her shield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors had spread like wildfire. Charles knew the second the media got wind of Serena and Brandon&#39;s confrontation, there would be no escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shouts rose from the chaos. &#34;We&#39;ve got the story!Brandon just bought a tanzanite for Vivian! That&#39;s not all! Serena and Brandon started a bidding war-tanzanite that should be a million dollars went for twenty-five million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another voice joined in, frantic. &#34;Look, it&#39;s Serena!Hurry up, she&#39;s right there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd reacted instantly, surging toward Millie and Charles as if driven by instinct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With panic rising, they tried to retreat inside, but the way was blocked-people pressed in from every side,and even the dog wouldn&#39;t give way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new wave of excitement swept through as someone cried out, &#34;Brandon&#39;s coming out, and Vivian&#39;s withhim!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Over here! They&#39;re heading this way, move, move!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one gets through! Someone keeps the doors blocked too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In seconds, the mob redirected, trampling over each other to get closer to Brandon and Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who&#39;d been guarding the back grumbled under their breath. &#34;Just my luck! I ended up with Serena instead of Brandon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to help himself, Charles scoffed, &#34;If you&#39;re so desperate, try going after him instead of crowding us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pandemonium reigned, shouts, flashes, and barking dogs blending into a single roar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an attempt to calm things, the mansion security blared the siren at full volume.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos didn&#39;t budge. The noise did nothing to thin the wall of people pressing closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had just been swept up in a grand gesture-Brandon&#39;s wild bid that sent millions flying just to please her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Serena, known from her time on Heavenly Melody,went head-to-head with him in the auction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had to be headlines-bold,impossible to ignore,splashed across every front page!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But wasn&#39;t Serena still right there next to Charles?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity turned into interrogation as a reporter called out, &#34;Serena, why did you try to outbid Brandon? Is there something going on between you two? What does that leave Mr. Evans?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That question cut right through Charles. Was he just invisible now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like all his significance had been erased in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one had ever made Charles feel so irrelevant before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to hold back, he snapped, &#34;If you don&#39;t have real questions, keep your mouths shut and get lost!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one so much as glanced at him; his anger barely registered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, every camera, every light, every microphone was locked onto Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no dodging the crowd this time, and Millie realized it was pointless to stay silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a breath and said to the reporters, &#34;I bid against Mr. Watson because I genuinely wanted the item. That&#39;s all there is to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Skepticism rippled through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles jumped in, voice raised. &#34;Take it or leave it!The truth is, Serena and Brandon only ever crossed paths at the Heavenly Melody&#39;s first episode recording.Since then, there&#39;s been no contact. Something going on between them? You&#39;re just making up stories!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reporter turned to him. &#34;Mr. Evans, why are you so upset? Is it because we&#39;re right about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration bubbled up, and Charles looked about ready to start swinging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side of the crowd, Brandon moved through the throng with an icy calm, his presence alone keeping people at arm&#39;s length.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even surrounded by the press, Brandon&#39;s status created a clear bubble; no one dared get too close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Planting himself firmly in front of Vivian, Brandon took on the role of her shield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions rained down, relentless and sharp. &#34;Mr.Watson, reports say you swore to win the tanzanite for Vivian, bidding against Serena and walking away with a $25 million price tag. Is it true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another voice chimed in, &#34;Is your bold move a declaration of love for Vivian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashes erupted as someone asked, &#34;Does appearing here at the auction with Vivian mean you&#39;re finally going public with your relationship?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Accusations came next. &#34;Does this signal your intention to divorce your wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowns creased Brandon&#39;s brow while he faced the barrage in stoic silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chose not to dignify the chaos with a response.Vivian, on the other hand, had been waiting for just this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d pushed for their attendance tonight precisely to capture this spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Brandon, Vivian offered a gentle, practiced smile.&#34;Let me take this one.&#34; With that, she slipped past him, stepping confidently into the reporters &#39;crosshairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lights converged, and every camera swung in her direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone.&#34; Vivian managed a smile that suited the moment, though a hint of fragility lingered behind it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We came to this charity auction simply to show our support for children in need. As for Brandon making headlines...&#34; She paused, letting her gaze sweep the crowd. &#34;Well, wherever Brandon goes, attention follows, no matter how quietly he tries to act. There&#39;s no use pretending otherwise. About the tanzanite,yes,I was interested at first. It was valued at around a  million. Brandon&#39;s winning bid was simply his way of maximizing the donation. Please don&#39;t read too much into it. He&#39;s here tonight at my request to help bring awareness to these children. That&#39;s all. Please don&#39;t let wild rumors take hold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of fragility colored her smile as she continued.&#34;My health is failing. All I want is to do something meaningful while I still can. Serena just happened to want the same stone; there&#39;s no need to turn it into drama or drag her name through the mud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Poised and gracious, Vivian finished her speech with a respectful bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising back up, she suddenly swayed, the color draining from her face, before she collapsed right in front of the crowd.</p>
