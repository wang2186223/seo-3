                <p>Talking about the past now was pointless.What once was no longer mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All Millie could say was that her love had been sincere.And when she chose to take it back, that decision had been just as sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at the wooden fox carving in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fox?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that how Egbert saw her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she had never been sly or cunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had only ever given her heart. And now, that heart was worn thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held out the carving to Egbert, but he didn&#39;t take it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep it,&#34; he said softly. &#34;Since I&#39;ve come back, I should at least offer you something. I carved it myself.It&#39;s not worth much, but you can come to me one day with it and make a request.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled. &#34;Anything you want from me. Even if it means giving you everything I have-my life included.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the years,he had come to understand something.It wasn&#39;t that he had never met the one he loved-it was that she had once stood before him, and he simply hadn&#39;t realized it. 1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And back then, she had belonged to someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily for him, she was now free. And so was he. It gave him hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie only smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a quiet sigh and placed the carving back in his hand. &#34;What would I do with your life? Keep it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to get caught up in tangled feelings again. One Brandon had been enouggh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert looked like he wanted to speak, but a shadow fell over them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled at Egbert, and then turned to Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two have been talking for a while. Thought I&#39;d come over,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who do you think you are to-&#34; Egbert&#39;s tone was  sharp at first, but then he stopped when he turned and saw the newcomer.He studied Myron&#39;s face.&#34;It&#39;s you?&#34;His eyes moved between the two of them, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took Millie&#39;s hand and gently pushed Egbert&#39;s away the fox still in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look,&#34; Myron said. &#34;If she doesn&#39;t want it, don&#39;t force it. That&#39;s just disrespectful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice stayed calm, but the message was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert&#39;s face darkened. He looked like he had more to say,but Myron was already holding Millie&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go,&#34; Myron said. &#34;Isn&#39;t Ari&#39;s class about to finish?It&#39;s time to pick her up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert&#39;s gaze dropped to their joined hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie fought the urge to laugh and gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right,&#34; she said before turning to Egbert.&#34;Enjoy your time back home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two-&#34; Egbert began, but they were already walking away. He stood there, unsure of what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the car, Millie fastened her seatbelt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know him?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve met through business,&#34; Myron said as he started the engine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive was quiet and smooth. Soon, they reached Ari&#39;s school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie was unbuckling her seatbelt when Myron spoke.&#34;We said we&#39;d meet twelve times, just the two of us,&#34;he reminded her. &#34;Let&#39;s start the day after tomorrow.What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of unease passed through him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just finalized her divorce, and already others were circling. He didn&#39;t want to fall behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie was surprised but remembered her promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After thinking it over, she smiled. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Watson Group, Brandon looked grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene had just called a doctor to treat the bruises on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phone calls kept coming in from abroad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shareholders were demanding answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reporters had already gathered outside the building.Online, rumors were spreading fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson,&#34; Eugene said carefully, &#34;everyone&#39;s asking when the press conference will begin. They&#39;re waiting for a statement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it wasn&#39;t an emergency, he wouldn&#39;t have risked souring Brandon&#39;s mood further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stayed silent, his eyes shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he could see was Millie. That distant expression on her face. That easy warmth she shared with Egbert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jealousy burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenched his right hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson?&#34; Eugene asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In half an hour,&#34; Brandon finally said. &#34;Use the third conference room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Eugene let out a breath.&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, a new post appeared online. &#34;Brandon Watson will hold a press conference in thirty minutes to address divorce-related issues.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news spread fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some were there for the gossip. Others worried about how it would affect the company&#39;s future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Egbert, who rarely paid attention to such things,found himself watching the stream</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time moved quickly. The moment arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the building, Vivian stood beside Brandon. &#34;Are you sure about this?&#34; she asked quietly.&#34;Is now really the right time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette was less diplomatic. She was enraged.&#34;Why does Millie get to vanish while you&#39;re left cleaning up the mess?&#34; 1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave her a cold glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian hesitated, and then asked, &#34;Do you want me to come with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the door and stepped into the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was packed with reporters. Flashbulbs went off the moment he entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,at the Elliott Mansion,Millie sat with Ari After picking the girl up, Myron had suggested stopping by his place so she could play with his cat Ari was excited, so Millie agreed to bring her along</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The television in the room was playing Brandon&#39;s press conference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Millie and I have finalized our divorce,&#34; Brandon said. His voice was calm. &#34;We signed a prenuptial agreement when we married, so there&#39;s no billion-dollar stock split like everyone so feared of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused. &#34;And while we are officially separated, the asset division is still ongoing. Updates will follow. As for the partnerships Millie managed, Watson Group will appoint successors shortly. There&#39;s no cause for concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cameras continued to flash. Reporters readied their questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson,&#34; one asked, &#34;can you tell us the reason for the divorce? We noticed the timing overlaps with your frequent public appearances alongside Vivian.Was she involved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s eyes narrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could respond, another voice spoke up. &#34;Mr.Watson, what exactly did Millie take with her? You said the asset division was still ongoing. Wasn&#39;t this supposed to be agreed on and done before the divorce was finalized?&#34;</p>
