                <p>Four episodes have aired since Heavenly Melody debuted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the beginning, most of the buzz centered around Vivian since show didn&#39;t feature any top-ranking vocalists, and the oldest contestant was only twenty-five, clearly placing them in the fresh crop of rising talent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But things shifted halfway through the season.Serena stole the spotlight, stunning viewers with her skill and artistry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the third episode on, once, the technical constraints on sound and video were resolved,her talent became undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the fallout after episode four.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors exploded online, accusations of donation fraud, inappropriate dealings for influence, and other scandals tied to Serena surfaced. Despite the uproar,she hadn&#39;t exited the competition, even as the finale approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Internet erupted with backlash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening? Why hasn&#39;t Serena been kicked out yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll give them until tomorrow morning. If she&#39;s still in,I&#39;m dropping a one-star review.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If someone like Serena can just keep climbing, then what&#39;s the point in anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boycott Serena!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The show&#39;s official account was overwhelmed with angry replies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their latest post was buried beneath a storm of protests and insults.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evans Entertainment&#39;s page was caught in the fire as well. No one really knew Serena&#39;s background, so the public turned its fury toward the company behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Daphne got pulled into the mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During one of the rehearsals, she uploaded a vlog.The video included a masked figure, but it was obvious to anyone watching,it was Serena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Countless comments flooded in, all asking the same thing-was that Serena in the video, and had she finally dropped out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Daphne kept silent. But the noise grew too loud to ignore. Eventually, she responded. &#34;Please stop asking me, or this post might disappear. The show isn&#39;t mine to decide. What you see is what it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That response carried layers of meaning, prompting a wave of speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please stop asking me, or this post might disappear&#34; suggested she&#39;d been warned not to  attract too much attention or the post would be taken down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The show isn&#39;t mine to decide&#34; hinted that Serena had powerful backing, most likely Evans Entertainment-the real decision-maker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And &#34;What you see is what it is&#34; confirmed what everyone already suspected: the masked contestant in the rehearsal clip was Serena, and she wasn&#39;t backing down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some users were incredibly perceptive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daphne couldn&#39;t help but laugh as she read through the responses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You guys are unbelievable,&#34; she said, wiping away a tear from the corner of her eye from laughing too hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at her tablet, where the newest documents from her agency were pulled up, outlining the business deals lined up after the Heavenly Melody finale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sponsorships were listed according to final rankings,and the rewards from Elliott Group stood out the most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; have to win,&#34; Daphne murmured, tapping firmly on the screen. &#34;If I can lock in Elliott Group, I&#39;ll never have to worry about anything ever again. Serena,what&#39;s the point in being so gifted? Even if you force your way to the top, the public&#39;s already turned on you. The backlash won&#39;t stop, it&#39;ll only grow stronger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that very moment, Millie stepped out of the Evans Entertainment training building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she walked toward the parking lot, a few soft honks sounded, followed by a quiet &#34;meow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her head and spotted a man leaning casually against his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore a fitted black shirt, holding a bag in one hand. In the other, he cradled a ragdoll cat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since rumors about her and Charles had begun circulating, Millie had taken to wearing a mask and cap whenever she entered or left the practice rooms.Still, Myron always managed to recognize her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d once offered to recommend a lawyer, but she had already hired Darrion and turned him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He insisted there were no strings attached, but Millie couldn&#39;t pretend she didn&#39;t understand the subtext.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those thoughts drifting in the back of her mind,she approached him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need something?&#34; she asked, halting just in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My last message,remember the video I sent you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one of my cat doing a backflip? You didn&#39;t reply,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meow,&#34; the cat chimed in, round eyes blinking up at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; Millie blinked, taken off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered, Myron went on, full of confidence. &#34;You see-having a cat this skilled makes it hard not to brag. I&#39;ve been itching to show off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stared at him, trying to make sense of what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could respond, Myron crouched down,set the ragdoll cat gently on the ground, and offered it a small treat. He then gave its head a quick pat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meow!&#34; Then, astonishingly, the cat flipped backward in one clean motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s lips parted slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did it really just do that? Right on cue?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was... surprisingly smart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cat padded over to her, brushing against her leg and purring, its tail held high. It tilted its head and meowed again, clearly asking for attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like it has a thing for you,&#34;	Myron said,smiling as he held out a small freeze-dried snack.&#34;You can feed it,if you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked from the cat to the treat in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a short pause, she gave in. She crouched beside the cat and offered it the snack, her hand steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cat purred happily while it ate, and Millie found herself smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It really was cute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got you a late-night snack.&#34; Myron lifted a thermos box from his bag just as she focused on the cat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie glanced up at him. Every movement-unhurried, tidy, unforced-fit him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her eyes again, gave the cat the last bit of the treat, and rose to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I appreciate it, but I don&#39;t need it.&#34; Her tone stayed polite, but she kept her distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a small nod and headed for her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My offer still stands,&#34; Myron called after her. &#34;I&#39;d be honored if you ever decide to take me up on it. Use me, Millie, I won&#39;t mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand stalled on the door handle for just a beat.She didn&#39;t turn around. She simply slipped into the driver&#39;s seat and pulled away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Myron remained in the lot, the cat nudging at his leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a quiet breath and scooped it up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It stings a little, doesn&#39;t it?&#34; he asked the animal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine. I expected as much.&#34; He stroked the soft furry head and watched her taillights fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie reached home, cleaned up, and went straight  moot to bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to overthink the encounter. Tomorrow&#39;s competition was all that mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If everything went according to plan, she&#39;d remove the mask at the end of the show.</p>
