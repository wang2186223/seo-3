                <p>In the meeting room,people glanced at one another,and a ripple of murmurs spread through them</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is that? Why is he acting arrogant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t he the head of that big conglomerate from Flesta? | heard that back when the Watson Group was trying to turn things around, they ran into serious tech hurdles. Then Mr. Watson and Mrs. W-I mean Millie,flew to Flesta to lock in a deal, and the first signature they got was from this guy&#39;s family. That was when things really started to change for the Watson Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I see. The Perez family, right? I&#39;ve heard they&#39;ve got insane influence overseas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. Once their contract came through, the other deals followed like dominoes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So that&#39;s what happened...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the room buzzed with speculation, Egbert said nothing. His eyes stayed on Brandon, intense and sharp-like someone who&#39;d clawed his way through fire and blood to get where he was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things in Flesta weren&#39;t like here. Guns weren&#39;t illegal there. One didn&#39;t get to the top of the business world with board meetings and polite handshakes. One got there by surviving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert finally said, &#34;No seat for me?&#34; His smile was casual. &#34;When you and Millie came to Flesta, l remembered I showed great hospitality.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lingered on those words, &#34;great hospitality.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s eyes didn&#39;t waver. He met Egbert&#39;s look head-on, cold and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air between them felt charged. Each look they shared was sharp, wordless, and full of challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room itself seemed to hold its breath, wrapped in a silence that throbbed with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs spread among those present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening? What was he talking about just now? How exactly did that contract come to be?Wasn&#39;t it handled through the proper channels?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on. Back then, Watson Group didn&#39;t stand a chance against Egbert&#39;s conglomerate. There&#39;s no way they landed that deal without his approval. But... there were whispers. Something strange happened around then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like what?&#34; &#34;No one knows for sure. But after that trip, Millie was bedridden for weeks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t you see it yet? Everything falling apart now started the moment Millie pulled away from the Watsons. In those early days, when the company was trying to find its footing, she was there, right next to Mr. Watson, step for step. The two of them were in it together,completely intertwined.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off tothe side, Babette was the first to snap back to herself. She walked up with a polished smile and motioned toward an open seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This way, please,&#34; she said sweetly.Her eyes lingered on Egbert,bright with a hint of admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Egbert didn&#39;t budge. He kept his gaze locked on Brandon, making it clear he wouldn&#39;t move unless Brandon invited him himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette&#39;s smile froze for a second, but then softened again like nothing happened. She turned to her cousin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon?&#34; she said carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered all the rumors she heard from her time in Flesta-stories that sounded dramatic and unclear,involving Egbert, the Watsons, and Millie. No one ever confirmed anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when Babette tried to corner Millie and get the truth out of her, Millie had revealed nothing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,worry took hold of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned slightly as she slipped her phone from her clutch, hoping to sneak away and call Millie. But Brandon&#39;s glare stopped her cold. One look, and she put the phone away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert caught the whole thing. He grinned maliciously.&#34;Not planning to show me even a little hospitality?&#34; he said. &#34;And what? Aren&#39;t you going to try calling Millie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out his own phone. &#34;It&#39;s alright. I&#39;ll call her myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot Babette a pointed smile. &#34;Thanks for the wine you sent to Millie. That&#39;s actually my favorite.Thought I&#39;d ask her what she thought ofit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile never reached Egbert&#39;s eyes. Babette felt a chill run through her. Something about Egbert reminded her of a dangerous snake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t pause. He started to dial. Then, just before he could press the button, a hand gripped his wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert looked straight at Brandon, their eyes locking. &#34;Going to stop me now?&#34; he asked with a smirk,sliding one hand into his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second later, Brandon felt something cold press against his abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t flinch. He narrowed his eyes, stepped forward without hesitation, and closed the distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You dorealize this isn&#39;t Flesta,&#34; Brandon said quietly &#34;There are gun laws here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert chuckled low, unmoved. His eyes stayed fixed on Brandon as he raised his phone and started to dial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon made a move for Egbert&#39;s pocket, but Egbert was quick. He dodged and took a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; Millie&#39;s voice came through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert smiled and looked right at Brandon&#39;s face,taking in the tightness in his jaw. &#34;Millie,&#34; he said smoothly. &#34;It&#39;s me. Been a while. How&#39;ve you been?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other end stayed completely silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon lunged again, aiming for the gun. Egbert didn&#39;t hold back this time. He pulled it out from his pocket and raised it straight to Brandon&#39;s forehead. Seeing Brandon&#39;s eyes narrow, Egbert smirked and said,&#34;I heard you and Brandon got divorced. Congrats!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie still didn&#39;t reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So-&#34; Egbert continued, chuckling. &#34;I&#39;m here at Watson Group. Thought we could revisit that old contract we signed years ago.How about you drop by?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two men stood locked in silence, eyes unblinking,neither backing down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around them, the murmurs had dried up. People glanced at one another, unsure, uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room held its breath. In that moment, it felt like nothing else existed-just the two men facing off and Millie on the phone line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three long seconds passed before Millie finally said,&#34;All right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert smiled and kept his eyes fixed on Brandon,already smug. &#34;Great! I knew you&#39;d-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before Egbert could get the words out, the line went dead, the flat beep of disconnection filling the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, he just stood there, caught off guard,his eyes dropping to the phone in his hand. Millie had hung up on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could react, Brandon seized the moment and reached forward to snatch the gun from his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, Egbert pulled the trigger. Then, a small flower sprang from the barrel,leaving Brandon frozen in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Surprise!&#34; Egbert laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a toy gun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room exhaled all at once, the tension evaporating like mist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon let go of Egbert&#39;s hand and turned to Babette and Eugene. &#34;You two handle things here. If it gets messy, stall. Say we&#39;ll hold a press conference to explain everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; Babette replied instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood, Mr. Watson,&#34; Eugene responded as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon turned back to Egbert, eyes hard.&#34;You-come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert looked like he might ignore him. Brandon smirked. &#34;Unless you want everyone hearing what really happened back then.&#34; Egbert shrugged like it didn&#39;t matter. &#34;You think I care?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he glanced down at his phone again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She might care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Egbert followed Brandon out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Eugene, Babette, and a handful of stunned executives remained inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phones kept ringing without pause, but everyone&#39;s thoughts were consumed by curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette frowned, her cold glare sweeping across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you hear him? Get back to work!&#34; she snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chairs shifted. Heads bowed. The room fell back into motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere,Millie slowly lowered her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Myron had just stepped out from the vault where they&#39;d been reviewing the Elliott Group&#39;s new products.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s face had gone pale, eyes distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years back in Flesta, she had lost her first child. That memory still lived at the center of her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had avoided that place ever since. Avoided the people, the reminders, the weight of it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the business started to expand, she passed the Flesta branch to Babette, who had been studying there. But before that, it had been Millie who laid every brick, built every structure, forged every deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now Egbert was here. When had he arrived? And why now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the change in Millie&#39;s demeanor,Myron asked carefully, &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
