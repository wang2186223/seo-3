                <p>Giffard discovered the conversation both perplexing and intriguing, prompting him to step through the doorway with purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly are you discussing?&#34; he inquired, his curiosity evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey there, Giffard!&#34; Came the warm greeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the room stood two physicians, both longtime colleagues who had worked alongside him for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giffard acknowledged them with a measured nod before pressing forward. &#34;I couldn&#39;t help but overhear Vivian&#39;s name being mentioned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The physicians exchanged a meaningful look, their expressions growing more serious as they nodded in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The situation strikes me as peculiar,&#34; the taller doctor began, his voice weighted with concern.&#34;Vivian approached me not long ago, bringing her medical records along to secure painkillers. I strongly recommended she undergo a thorough examination to explore any possible treatments or methods to extend her life,yet she adamantly refused.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The taller doctor&#39;s expression darkened as he continued, &#34;I dismissed it initially as an isolated incident, but now the same troubling pattern has emerged once more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thinner colleague stepped forward, bobbing his head in agreement. &#34;She attempted to end her life by slashing her wrist, but following the bandaging and careful suturing, she simply vanished from our care.I proposed a comprehensive evaluation while we treated her, but she rejected it outright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What baffles me most,&#34; the thinner doctor continued,his voice filled with professional concern, &#34;is that patients typically refuse examinations or treatments only when they can&#39;t afford, but Vivian doesn&#39;t appear to face such problem. I mean, yes, she has terminal illness, but we can still do something to make it less painful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two medical professionals shared another weighted glance, their synchronized nods revealing shared bewilderment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giffard absorbed their words, his eyebrows knitting together in deep concentration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation was undeniably bizarre.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was her diagnosis of terminal cancer confirmed in Flaville? And all her medical records are there?&#34;Giffard questioned, his investigative instincts awakening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The taller doctor confirmed with a slow nod, but then quickly steered their discussion toward lunch arrangements, effectively abandoning the troubling topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Giffard couldn&#39;t shake the disturbing details from his thoughts and promptly contacted Millie to share the disturbing information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie discovered the situation equally perplexing,her memory drifting to how she had previously asked Charles to reach out to his connections in Flaville.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll press Charles for answers,&#34; Millie declared with determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds good,&#34; Giffard responded, pausing thoughtfully before he too began reaching out to his former classmates from medical school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Hussain family had maintained their medical practice across multiple generations, building an impressive legacy within the healthcare community and cultivating an extraordinarily vast professional network.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve established contact with my sources, but the information remains classified and will require  considerable time to obtain,&#34; Charles explained,offering Millie some measure of reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sensed something sinister lurking beneath the surface, but concrete evidence remained essential before drawing any definitive conclusions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her immediate priorities centered on Ari&#39;s upcoming surgery and the escalating legal battle with Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What devious scheme was Brandon orchestrating behind the scenes?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie struggled to comprehend his motivations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as these troubling thoughts consumed her attention, Derek&#39;s call interrupted her contemplation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s expression darkened with confusion-hadn&#39;t they resolved everything thoroughly during last night&#39;s conversation? What purpose could Derek possibly have for contacting her again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could there perhaps be an unexpected development in her quest to reclaim the Bennett family&#39;s former department?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With these questions swirling through her thoughts,Millie accepted the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, across the city at the imposing Watson Group headquarters, Derek sat behind his executive desk, directing a look of pure exasperation toward Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you just say? You harbor intentions of marrying Vivian?&#34; Derek&#39;s voice cracked with barely restrained fury, though the previous night&#39;s devastating revelations had somehow strengthened his emotional armor. &#34;I absolutely refuse to allow this travesty!&#34; Derek&#39;s piercing glare bore into Brandon with unmistakable contempt. &#34;And what in heaven&#39;s name happened to your battered face?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s composure wavered for just a moment.&#34;Millie struck me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You had it coming in spades!&#34; Derek proclaimed with unwavering conviction.&#34;You thoroughly deserved her wrath!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s head dropped in defeat, words failing him completely, while Derek&#39;s rage rendered him momentarily speechless with indignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, Norma observed the tense confrontation unfolding before her, her expression revealing layers of conflicted emotions as she studied Brandon&#39;s defeated posture. &#34;Brandon, you must consider this decision with utmost care and deliberation.Should you and Vivian proceed with marriage, there will be no possibility of reconciliation with Millie. Regardless of whatever justifications you might offer,&#34; Norma  explained with maternal concern. &#34;No woman will ever forgive a man who commits such a profound betrayal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s hands curled into tight, trembling fists at his sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once this entire ordeal reaches its conclusion,&#34; he muttered through gritted teeth. &#34;I&#39;ll provide her with a complete explanation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Explain exactly what?&#34; Derek exploded, striking Brandon sharply with his ornate walking cane. &#34;I&#39;m convinced you&#39;ve become completely infatuated with Vivian! Don&#39;t assume I remain ignorant of the truth;she masquerades herself as some modern,independent woman while boasting about her supposed achievements in luxury floral design, yet she&#39;s systematically draining your resources dry.Without your financial backing and your influential friends propping up her business, could she possibly maintain such an extravagant lifestyle? My investigation revealed that merely a year ago, she was operating nothing more than a modest neighborhood flower shop!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon maintained his downcast posture, lacking the courage to offer any defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek&#39;s fury blazed white-hot, refusing to dignify Brandon with even a cursory glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve already summoned Millie to join us here,&#34; Derek announced coldly, extending two official documents toward Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon accepted the papers with trembling hands,disdovering they contained detailed wager agreements stipulating that specific conditions must be satisfied before the contractual terms would be officially executed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brow furrowed with genuine confusion as he lifted his eyes to meet Derek&#39;s stern expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Watson family refuses to sink so low as to retain Millie&#39;s rightful possessions through such shameless means,&#34; Derek declared with unwavering conviction.&#34;She remained faithfully by your side for seven complete years, enduring every hardship and triumph alongside you. These items legitimately belong to her ownership.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa!&#34; Brandon caught himself as his tone turned sharp,desperately attempting to regulate his spiraling emotions. &#34;I simply cannot surrender them to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely shameless!&#34; Derek struck him once more with his cane, the sound echoing sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Brandon remained steadfast in his opposition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had committed countless acts that wounded Millie deeply, and her anguish and tears continued to plague his conscience relentlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guilt left him perpetually sleepless and emotionally devastated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood with crystal clarity that she despised him completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She loathed his betrayal, despised how he had systematically destroyed her trust and happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could only desperately cling to the Bennett family&#39;s possessions, using them as leverage to prevent her from drifting too far beyond his reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once this terrible ordeal finally concluded,he would lay bare every hidden truth before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew with absolute certainty that she had always dreamed of creating a loving home with him and raising their children together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had not yet made their divorce proceedings public knowledge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Therefore,she would eventually find it in her heart to forgive his transgressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, to make all that happen, first he needed to keep her within his sphere of influence..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I cannot relinquish these belongings to her,&#34; Brandon repeated,his eyes now bloodshot with raw emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek responded with a cold, mocking laugh, &#34;I anticipated exactly that response from you, which is precisely why I drafted this wager agreement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa...&#34; Brandon continued to voice his disagreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You constantly claim that Vivian is dying, so you feel compelled to indulge her every whim. But what consideration do you show for my remaining life?&#34;Derek fixed Brandon with an intense stare. &#34;This agreement provides you with one final opportunity.Should you refuse to participate, I&#39;ll end my life right here before your very eyes! Don&#39;t you dare forget that when I was drawing my last breaths,you grasped Millie&#39;s hand and fell to your knees before me,desperately pleading for my blessing on your marriage!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s eyes blazed crimson with overwhelming emotion as he rapidly scanned through the agreement&#39;s contents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that precise moment, someone rapped firmly against the office door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene stepped inside with professional composure &#34;Mr.Watson, Mrs. W-Miss Bennett and Vivian have arrived as requested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing that Brandon had ceased his protests,Derek nodded his approval. &#34;Please escort them inside immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consequently, Millie and Vivian entered the office together, their contrasting energies immediately apparent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie acknowledged everyone with a polite, restrained nod, while Vivian radiated unbridled enthusiasm.&#34;Good afternoon, Mr. Watson, Mrs. Watson.&#34; Vivian felt her heart soar with unexpected joy. They had finally agreed to meet with her personally, which perhaps signaled their grudging acceptance of her presence?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier that morning, Brandon had just warned.her emphatically that his grandparents refused to see her regardless of the circumstances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two take a look at these documents carefully,&#34;Derek instructed as he handed the papers to Eugene,who efficiently distributed copies to both Millieand Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie studied the document&#39;s contents intently, her eyes narrowing with sharp focus as she absorbed each crucial detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;According to the terms outlined in this agreement,&#34;Derek began with deliberate formality. &#34;Millie, should you emerge victorious, within exactly three months,all the items you desire will be transferred directly into your legal ownership.&#34;</p>
