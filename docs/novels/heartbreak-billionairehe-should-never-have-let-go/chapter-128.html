                <p>Milliewanted to lie. She wanted to say, &#34;No, I don&#39;t,&#34;just to make things easier. Just to get through the day and walk away with the divorce papers tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she thought about the baby she lost, the tanzanite he took, and all the love she had poured into him, the words simply wouldn&#39;t come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she not blame him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her emotions churned inside her like a storm she couldn&#39;t calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie.&#34; Brandon called her again.&#34;Answer me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were slightly red when he asked, &#34;Do you blame me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie turned her head and took a deep breath. Her eyes were wet. She looked at him. He looked just the same as she remembered. In his eyes, maybe there had been guilt once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie...&#34; he whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her fingers hard into her palm, trying to hold herself together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she steadied hervoice and said, &#34;What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just four words-but they cut deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon opened his mouth, but no sound came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at her. Her eyes shimmered with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowly looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should blame me,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the car, the wind rustled through the trees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re angry,&#34; Brandon said quietly, his gaze fixed on the swaying branches. &#34;And you should be.I hurt you because of Vivian.&#34; He paused. &#34;But Millie, I had my reasons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed quiet, watching him. Then, suddenly,she let out a soft laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course. He always had his reasons. His dilemmas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what about her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he ever stop to think about what she meant to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lately, I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about the past,&#34;Brandon said. &#34;Sometimes, I feel lost. Like things shouldn&#39;t have turned out this way. I remember when we first got together... Our first kiss... You curled up in my arms saying you loved me and that we&#39;d always be together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice softened. &#34;I remember how hard we worked. How we agreed to move forward together.That we couldn&#39;t keep holding on to the old ways.We fought to change Watson Group. We led the team,broke through technical barriers, and earned contracts overseas. I remember those days, Millie.Side by side, through thick and thin. And..&#34;His voice broke.&#34;And the baby we lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s nose stung. He couldn&#39;t keep his voice steady anymore. He stared blankly at the trees outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie sighed gently, still not looking at him. Her eyes turned to the other window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to control her breathing. Tried to stay calm.&#34;You said you&#39;d stay with me. And you did. But what l promised you... I haven&#39;t done that. But I will. I&#39;ll be your support. Just like I promised,&#34; Brandon replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie,&#34; he said again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t answer. She just kept her gaze on the rain-streaked window, hiding her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past they shared... It had been beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had faced so much together. Leaned on each other. Survived it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She used to believe that after all those years-after all those nights-they would walk through life hand in hand.That they would be each other&#39;s forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But not long after they got married... He fell for someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seven years. Defeated by a few fleeting months with Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had lost. Or maybe... She just never truly understood him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me, okay?&#34; Brandon said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie lowered her eyes. She took a long breath.&#34;What about Vivian?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice dropped to a whisper, &#34;Brandon, how do you expect me to trust you after everything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence that followed was heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie bit her lip, holding herself back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Brandon said, &#34;She only has five months. After that... Everything will go back to normal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie let out a hollow laugh. Tears finally rolled down her cheeks. &#34;Brandon, do you really think I&#39;m that cheap? That I&#39;d just stand by while you&#39;re with her,and say nothing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked straight at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he really expect her to forgive everything? To forget the affair? To come back to him five months later like nothing ever happened? As if the fact that he left her for another woman never existed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nearly voiced all of this. But tomorrow, they&#39;d get divorced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought held her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she said was, &#34;You were the one who asked for a divorce a month ago. So tell me, Brandon... How can you expect me to trust you? What do you take me for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon frowned. He reached out to wipe her tears,but she pushed his hand away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I take you as my wife,&#34; he said softly, watching her turn away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not after tomorrow,&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if I don&#39;t go through with it? The divorce isn&#39;t final yet. Until we get that paper, Millie... we&#39;re still married,&#34; Brandon said quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of lightning split the sky, followed by deep,rumbling thunder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the rain, tapping gently on the windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie turned to look at him, her face serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes, bloodshot and sorrowful, met hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stared at each other, as if trying to find the truth. But their hearts had grown too far apart. They could no longer see clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what about her? Vivian. She&#39;s dying, isn&#39;t she?&#34;Millie asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s eyes flickered. He didn&#39;t know how to answer.He closed his eyes and leaned back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the rain fell harder. Alexia and Giffard stood under umbrellas, quietly discussing whether to come get Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon finally said, &#34;Five months. Just wait five months.Everything will be back to normal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t respond. She just stared at him, heart aching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So...He really did love Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia and Giffard began walking toward them,holding umbrellas borrowed from the station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia tapped on the car door. &#34;Are you two done talking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re done,&#34; Millie said, reaching for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as her hand touched the handle, Brandon spoke. &#34;Millie, do you love me?&#34;</p>
