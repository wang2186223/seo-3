                <p>Brandon&#39;s body radiated warmth as his strong arms wrapped firmly around Millie&#39;s waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Millie stood frozen, arms stiff at her sides. Then, gathering herself, she slowly placed a trembling hand on his chest and gently but firmly pushed him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint spell of lightheadedness washed over her,though it had nothing to do with intoxication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They boarded the buggy in silence, heading toward Brandon&#39;s place in the estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The journey unfolded in silence, a quiet tension stretching between them. Not a single word passed until the vehicle rolled to a halt near a cluster of trees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. and Mrs. Watson,&#34; Matthew began respectfully,&#34;Mrs. Norma Watson told me to remind you that Mr.Derek Watson expects to see you both first thing in the morning. So, you&#39;ll need to spend the night here at the estate.&#34; He paused, observing the emotional distance between them with a quiet sigh. &#34;Truthfully,they&#39;ve both been deeply concerned for a while now.Asking you to stay is just a pretense. What they really want... is for you to open up to each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brushed at the corners of his eyes, visibly emotional. &#34;I still remember when you first brought her home, sir. The way you looked at each other-it was like something out of a storybook. So much love back then. I just... I don&#39;t understand how it got tothis point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat and blinked quickly, brushing away the shimmer in his eyes. &#34;Please... talk. Maybe that&#39;s all it&#39;ll take to set things right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy breath, Matthew stepped back and disappeared into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Above them, the night had fully unfurled, stars cloaked behind drifting clouds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Golden lights lit the path ahead, winding softly through the trees toward a certain villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon took the first step, heading into the grove without a word. But Millie didn&#39;t follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing her stillness, he stopped and looked back over his shoulder. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll head back for now,&#34; Millie said quietly,her tone even. &#34;I&#39;ll come by in the morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to leave, but before she could take another step, Brandon reached out and caught her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie,&#34; he said, his voice steady but low. &#34;It&#39;s been days since we last saw each other. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time we talked?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Talk? Was there truly anything left to say?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few steps away, the silver light of the moon spilled across the surface of the lake, turning the ripples into sheets of soft glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s voice cut through the silence again, this time firmer. &#34;At the very least... about the child.I deserve an explanation.&#34; His grip remained firm. &#34;You never gave me answers. And I can&#39;t face them-my grandparents-without knowing the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie turned her face away, her gaze drifting into the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After her session with Rita,she drifted along aimlessly,unsure of what to do next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometime later, Charles mentioned that the charity event&#39;s funds were finally being allocated and asked if she&#39;d like to see where the resources were directed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious about how the money from the tanzanite sale was utilized,she accepted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was how she found herself standing in frontof a welfare center in Crobert. She had purchased a painting at the auction-Ari&#39;s painting-without knowing it would lead her here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was fate. Or maybe... the child she lost had found another way to stay close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tanzanite. A donation. A painting bought on impulse.All of it had woven a path that led her to Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young girl had been left at the shelter long ago,discarded by her biological parents due to a chronic illness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a number of reasons, her condition had gone untreated for years. The fundraising event turned out to be a turning point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After only a handful of encounters, Millie felt something deeper, like it had been meant to happen.So she made a decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would adopt Ari. She would make sure she received the medical care she deserved, give her a proper education, and walk beside her through every stage of life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was one problem-Millie wasn&#39;t thirty yet,the legal minimum age to adopt. So,she reached out to the only person who could help, her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That afternoon, she found herself standing outside her mother&#39;s small business, watching silently from across the street. After several long moments, she took a breath and called out for the first time in ages,&#34;Mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s mother agreed to help with the adoption paperwork. Though the legal process would take time,it had already begun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Officially, Ari would be registered as Millie&#39;s younger sister-but everyone involved knew the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie was the one who longed to be Ari&#39;s mother. And Ari understood that, too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Ari expressed her wish to attend school, Millie found a small private preschool in Crobert, one that respected children&#39;s privacy and emotional needs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was the early abandonment or the years spent in a quiet welfare center. Or maybe it was just her age. Whatever the reason, Ari often seemed unsure,like she was still learning how to move through the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That morning at the preschool entrance,Ari froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie knelt beside her, gently pulling down her mask to reveal a soft, reassuring smile. &#34;What is it?&#34; she asked kindly. &#34;Are you scared?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari gave a hesitant nod, but then quickly shook her head.Conflicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t rush her. She simply waited, calm and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long silence, Ari looked up, her small voice barely a whisper.&#34;Mom...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she immediately dropped her gaze, as if unsure she had the right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I have to call you that?&#34; she asked, almost too quietly to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie reached out and gently smoothed Ari&#39;s hair.&#34;Only if it feels right,&#34; she said softly. &#34;If it&#39;s too soon,you can call me Miss Bennett, or just Millie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari blinked, visibly relieved. She nodded quickly, her lips curving into a shy smile. &#34;Miss Bennett,&#34; she said in a quiet voice, wrapping her arms around Millie for a quick embrace before dashing inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stood still for a moment, watching as Ari reached the classroom door. The little girl turned around, gave a small wave, and then disappeared inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That fleeting second-Millie without her face covering -was all it took for the cameras to capture her.Despite all her efforts to remain unnoticed,someone had managed to snap the photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guardianship paperwork was still in progress,which meant Millie was allowed to accompany Ari to school, but couldn&#39;t yet bring her home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was only a matter of time now. On average, the paperwork was processed within thirty business days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought in mind, Millie turned to speak. &#34;She has no ties with the Watson family. So don&#39;t worry.She won&#39;t be there to fight for your family&#39;s inheritance or property.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped her hand out of Brandon&#39;s grasp. A soft wind stirred the air, and the faint warmth of the alcohol she had earlier consumed returned, making her feel lightheaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, she stepped out of her heels and stood barefoot on the grass, her back to him. &#34;That&#39;s all there is to say,&#34; she continued calmly. &#34;You&#39;ve heard enough. I&#39;ll tell your grandparents the same thing tomorrow. And if you doubt anything I&#39;ve said,go and check for yourself. I have no reason to lie,Brandon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath, straightened her shoulders,and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie!&#34; Brandon called after her, his voice tense with emotion. &#34;Does it really have to end like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t pause. She had already made her choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We had a child once,&#34; Brandon called out again.&#34;You let her call you &#39;Mom&#39;... so what about me? What am I supposed to be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words echoed through the quiet grove, his voice carrying a weight it hadn&#39;t held before. The trees around them seemed to hold their breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or maybe this was your plan all along,&#34; he added,suspicion creeping into his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Brandon&#39;s mind, she had done all this on purpose.She had allowed the child to call her Mom where cameras might see it, ensuring that they would end up face-to-face again at the Watson estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie froze mid-step, her breath catching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something stirred deep in her chest-a tangled mix of emotions she couldn&#39;t name at first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it anger clawing its way up, or sorrow pressing down on her heart? Maybe it was both, crashing into each other all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never asked you this before... Back in Flesta, during those ten minutes I stepped away-what did you really say to him?&#34; Brandon spoke. &#34;We lost our child. Do you think I haven&#39;t suffered? I&#39;ve carried that pain with</p>
                
                
                
                <p>me every day since. You know exactly why I&#39;ve longed to become a parent all these years. So why would you twist something so sacred-why would you use a child as part of some scheme?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice came in a low, even voice. calm as still water But each word cut like glass, merciless and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest ached with the weight of his words.Her hands trembled, her breath caught somewhere between a sob and a scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he say something so cruel? How could someone who once held her heart speak with such emptiness?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slowly turned to face him. He stood in the moonlight, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps it was the distance between them-or perhaps the years-but in that moment, he didn&#39;t look like the man she once loved. He wore Brandon&#39;s face,but something inside him felt hollow... twisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this really him? Or had something changed so completely that he now looked like a stranger wearing his skin?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, Millie crossed the space between them. Her steps were swift, her heart pounding. And then-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand struck him hard across the face. The sharp sound echoed into the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her palm stung, but the pain didn&#39;t matter. He had already hurt her far worse.</p>
