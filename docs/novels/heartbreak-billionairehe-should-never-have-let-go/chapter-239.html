                <p>Millie and Myron arrived with Ari just as night had fully settled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari clutched the cat, pressing her forehead to its soft fur in a playful game. Her large, round eyes sparkled with affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron carried Ari as he walked beside Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they stepped inside, conversations briefly paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them-with the cat in tow-looked every bit like a picture-perfect family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint shadow crossed Giffard&#39;s eyes, gone almost as soon as it appeared, hidden behind his usual calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles, on the other hand, smiled lightly. &#34;Ari, don&#39;t you like me anymore? You didn&#39;t run over to me like before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron chuckled, setting Ari down and gently patting her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still hugging the cat, Ari skipped over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, this is Orange!&#34; she said, holding the cat toward Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could respond, the cat reached out and pressed a paw to his face, as if turning him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter rippled around the room, breaking the earlier tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mood warmed, and dinner carried on as usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles raised his glass in a toast to Millie&#39;s latest success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The tide&#39;s turning online. People are demanding answers from Vivian, and she&#39;s still silent. Her reputation may not survive this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What she did was vile!&#34; Alexia burst out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others joined in condemning Vivian&#39;s recent live stream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie felt a quiet warmth in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These friends stood by her through everything. She hoped they would stay this way forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through the meal, Millie excused herself to the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she returned, Charles stood in the hallway,looking torn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter, Charles?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He led her to the far end of the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the soft lights, the wind stirred the leaves outside the window. Charles&#39; face, as striking as ever,was calm but unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really like Myron? And it&#39;s not just to get away from Brandon or for some other reason?&#34; he asked quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s lips pressed together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day had come-this was a talk she knew she couldn&#39;t avoid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hard to answer?&#34; he asked when she stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head. &#34;No. I&#39;m just thinking of how to put it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles smiled faintly. &#34;What&#39;s there to fear? I don&#39;t bite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought about it. For all his temper, Charles wasn&#39;t really frightening. She knew that he was really a good man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her shoulders eased. She met his gaze and spoke firmly. &#34;Yes, I like him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile faltered for a moment, but he quickly masked it. &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes didn&#39;t waver. &#34;Yeah, really. Charles, the old me died the night I was pushed down the stairs. I&#39;m not that woman anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice held no hint of a smile. This was something that had to be said clearly, leaving no space for false hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve long let go of Brandon,&#34; she continued.&#34;Liking Myron came after-it&#39;s separate from all that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You fell for him just because of those few dates?&#34;he asked with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Because of those dates.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles looked like he had more to say, but the words never came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie sighed. &#34;For seven years, I was tired and numb.I thought I couldn&#39;t love anymore. Then he came along-patient, careful-and somehow, I felt alive again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles no longer looked playful. His eyes were shaded with something closer to sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Charles,&#34; she said softly, but stopped there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They simply looked at each other until Charles gave a small,resigned smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; he said with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a breath she hadn&#39;t realized she was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39; gaze shifted past her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and saw Giffard standing quietly behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked over, giving Millie&#39;s shoulder a gentle pat before looking at Charles. The two men exchanged a silent glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next week, the Watson Group launches their new product. Oakley might use the chance to sell those stocks he holds. My people will boe watching.Once the funds circle back, we&#39;ll have proof,&#34; Charles changed the subject and looked at Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles reminded himself not to think too far ahead.Working with Millie already gave him the upper hand in his family&#39;s feud. Wishing for more would be greedy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she had someone she liked, he should offer his blessings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giffard let out a quiet sigh. &#34;The international seminar in Flaville is coming up. I&#39;ll use it to look</p>
                
                
                
                <p>deeper into Vivian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Giffard. I know it&#39;s a lot to ask,&#34; Millie said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing. Don&#39;t mention it.&#34; Giffard smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew it wasn&#39;t easy, and she knew he helped because he cared for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to her, he was just like her big brother-and she had told him so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he&#39;d overheard her conversation with Charles,there was nothing more to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left them to talk and went back inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, Myron was feeding Ari with the ease of a seasoned father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her, he glanced over, his eyes saying more than his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re back?&#34; Myron asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Millie nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They exchanged a silent understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Alexia sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear her brother had no chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dinner wrapped up soon after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before heading home, Myron took Millie and Ari to the rooftop garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari still held the cat tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron placed her gently on the swing chair,and then took Millie&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been planning this for a while. Now it&#39;s finally time,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; she asked, curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Ari. &#34;Hold the cat tight-there might be some noise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay!&#34; Ari grinned, her eyes sparkling. She already knew, as Myron had told her during dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie glanced between them, puzzled, when</p>
                
                
                
                <p>suddenly, a swarm of drones lifted into the night sky,their lights glittering above.</p>
