                <p>As Brandon&#39;s car wound its way up the hill toward Serenity Villa, Millie&#39;s thumb flicked through a barrage of phone notifications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uneasy note crept into Charles&#39; voice, &#34;Could this stir up any trouble for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Personal risk hardly fazed him. Years at the helm of an entertainment company had thickened his skin against gossip, and bachelorhood gave him little to lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the court of public opinion reserved its harshest judgments for women. Millie&#39;s name could be dragged through the mud on nothing more than whispers, even though they both knew they had nothing to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Charles couldn&#39;t honestly say his feelings for her were strictly business. Yet he carried himself with restraint. He recognized the lines that should not be crossed and always kept his distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the hospital to Evans Entertainment and even at social functions, they never let their relationship drift beyond the space shared by colleagues and friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave a little shake of her head, unconcerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No big deal. I&#39;ll handle it with a statement,&#34; she murmured, already typing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A calmness settled over her. In contrast to her straightforward partnership with Charles, the messy entanglement between Brandon and Vivian was something else entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No point in delving into that now. Instead, she set her phone aside and said, &#34;It won&#39;t matter soon anyway.Brandon and I will have our divorce finalized in a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Call after call from Brandon had lit up her screen, along with a flood of unanswered texts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of it surprised her; it was exactly why she&#39;d silenced his every call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Full disconnection wasn&#39;t an option, not with legal loose ends and Bennett family business still unresolved. For now, he stayed in her contacts,if only for convenience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no sense in sparking a confrontation before the divorce became official.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made up her mind to stay quiet and out of sight until the papers were finally signed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Millie focused her attention on polishing her statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sidelong glance from Charles lingered on her profile before he spoke again, hesitance in every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happens if he backs out?&#34; he asked quietly. &#34;Before the divorce is finalized, either of you could still stop it from happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flicked over the post one final time before she pressed&#34;publish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He won&#39;t.&#34; A steady confidence colored her voice as she turned to watch the world blur by outside.&#34;Vivian&#39;s running out of time. If Brandon wants to fulfill her last wish, divorce is the only way forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beyond the glass, the street glimmered with the leftover confetti, a silent echo of some other couple&#39;s new beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth struck her; she and Brandon had barely made it through a single year as husband and wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of that whirlwind wedding still lingered, bright and fresh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then,Crobert had been transformed, every inch draped in white roses and gleaming with luxury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dress she wore was worth a fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon had orchestrated the whole affair, pouring his energy into every rushed detail, determined to make it flawless for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could still picture the way he lifted her into his arms, promising her a lifetime of love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still remember that look in his eyes, sincere, almost reverent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet less than twelve months had passed before he shattered that trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did it matter now? Millie forced herself to look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seven years of love couldn&#39;t be reclaimed, but once she accepted the truth, she resolved never to dwell in regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small, determined smile, Millie glanced at Charles. &#34;Anyway, I have proof of his affair. Even if he tries to call it off, I can still make the divorce happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh slipped from Charles as he met her steady gaze, quietly admiring her resilience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strength like hers was both admirable and heartbreaking to witness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, an Aston Martin cruised toward Serenity Villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mid-drive, Brandon&#39;s phone buzzed with a sharp notification.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick glance during a stoplight told him it was from Millie&#39;s social feed, a special alert he never ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One tap opened her post.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s statement was direct and unflinching. &#34;There is no truth to the recent rumors about Charles and me.Our friendship goes back years, and I was once an artist at Evans Entertainment. Our relationship has always remained professional and cordial. Other friends attended that dinner tonight as well; it was never just the two of us and a child. I kindly ask the media to stop circulating misinformation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The traffic signal flickered to green.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, Brandon locked his screen and guided the car forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No part of that public statement settled his nerves. The explanation rang hollow, and if he couldn&#39;t believe it, neither would anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance simmered beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, Millie had grown distant, and he couldn&#39;t shake the sense that she was hiding something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The urge to confront her grew with every mile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories from their last argument at Moonlit Estate resurfaced: her tears, the way she had pushed him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doubt gnawed at him. Had she turned cold because there was someone new in her life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled the years she had clung to him, always yielding to his wishes, even when she was worn out,his soft words could always change her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never rejected him, not until that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Charles the reason for her change? Or maybe it was Giffard, or someone else he hadn&#39;t even considered?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s fingers curled tighteraround the steering wheel, knuckles going stiff with pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sleek Aston Martin eased up the driveway and stopped at Serenity Villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling up to the driveway, Brandon stepped out and made his way to the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Complete darkness greeted him as he entered. Not a single lamp had been left burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown creased his forehead, echoing a sense of deja vu. This wasn&#39;t the first time he&#39;d come home to a house like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flipped every light switch in reach, chasing away the shadows, but silence echoed through every room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill crept in. Something felt fundamentally different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered his last visit, a quick trip to grab something before visiting his grandfather, when the darkness hadn&#39;t troubled him. Tonight, though, the emptiness was impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaw set, Brandon moved toward the master bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no sign of Millie. Not even the faintest trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing about the place suggested anyone had been living there recently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deeper scowl etched itself across Brandon&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she&#39;d simply switched rooms, maybe she hadn&#39;t gone far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a surge of hope, he began opening doors throughout the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Room after room revealed the same story-bare surfaces, untouched sheets, not a trace of daily life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to give in, Brandon made his way to the bathroom, searching for any sign she&#39;d been there.Only his toiletries remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two toothbrushes once stood side by side; now, his was the only one left, upright and lonely in its holder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how he tried to deny it, reality was staring him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His steps led him back to the master bedroom, eyes falling on the closet, now half-empty and forlorn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time when the space had held clothes belonging to them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Part of it held his things, the rest held hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, only his neatly pressed suits hung in rigid rows, untouched by anything warm or familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every detail pointed to one thing-Millie hadn&#39;t lived here for quite some time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A year ago, unless Millie was on a trip, staying at Moonlit Estate, or with him in his other houses, she always returned to this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had confided once that, after losing her father, she never really belonged anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years spent being pulled from place to place by her mother, and then watching her remarry, left her more lost than before. Even after her stepfather&#39;s departure, the tension at home never eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She used to call this place her sanctuary, a real home, something she&#39;d promised to hold onto, even when he was away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter the hour, she would always leave a light on for him, always ready to welcome him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each new piece of furniture, every little detail she&#39;d added, had filled the house with warmth and comfort. But now, those things remained but traces of her had vanished, casting a cold, sterile chill over the rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s hands curled into trembling fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silent ache settled in his chest, heavy and inescapable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she really moved on for good? Or was this some new test, another twist in her pattern of leaving and returning?</p>
