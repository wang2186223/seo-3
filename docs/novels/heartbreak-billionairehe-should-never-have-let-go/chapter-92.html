                <p>Brandon&#39;s harsh tone had already left Ari shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as Ari&#39;s sobs grew louder and filled the car, Brandon showed no sign of stopping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop the car!&#34; Millie demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,Brandon pressed on, the vehicle hurtling forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, she pulled Ari into a comforting embrace, gently stroking her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ari has a congenital heart condition. A defect she&#39;s had since birth,&#34; Millie explained, her voice trembling,eyes red-rimmed. &#34;Are you trying to kill her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having already endured the loss of two children, she was resolute: nothing would happen to Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this, Brandon&#39;s gaze flickered to the rearview mirror, where he saw Ari truly distraught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened. He slowly eased his foot off the accelerator, guiding the car to the side of the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of Millie&#39;s tear-filled eyes in the mirror, Brandon&#39;s grip on the steering wheel tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie said nothing more. She simply unbuckled her seatbelt, scooped Ari into her arms, and stepped out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret washed over her. She should never have succumbed to Brandon&#39;s threats and allowed Ar into his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she stood firm, Ari wouldn&#39;t have been subjected to such terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie!&#34; Brandon called after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie ignored him, hailing a taxi and directing the driver to Crobert Hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon, however, wasn&#39;t so easily deterred. He shadowed them from a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the Maybach trailing in the taxi&#39;s rearview mirror, Millie felt a mix of anger toward Brandon and frustration with herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked down at Ari, gently patting her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you feeling now, Ari? Are you uncomfortable?&#34; Millie asked, her voice laced with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari wiped the tears from her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m okay,&#34; Ari murmured, shaking her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you feel unwell, you must tell me,&#34; Millie urged softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari nodded and then curled into Millie&#39;s embrace, falling silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari was lost in thought, remembering the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though children&#39;s memories often fade quickly, she vividly recalled the fight right before her biological parents abandoned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, however, was different. Millie was here for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nestled in Millie&#39;s arms, Ari felt a sense of security.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The taxi pulled up directly to the hospital entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giffard was already waiting outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he spotted Millie and Ari, he rushed forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also noticed Brandon parking and getting out of his car just behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brandon approached, Millie handed Ari to Giffard and then turned to face Brandon alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie,&#34;Brandon said, hurrying over, a deep frown etched on his face. &#34;I didn&#39;t know Ari had a congenital heart condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie met his gaze. &#34;Whatever her condition is, you shouldn&#39;t be yelling in front of a child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon offered no argument. They simply stood there, locked in a tense stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since their last encounter, their interactions had always been laced with tension, leaving Brandon</p>
                
                
                
                <p>feeling utterly helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle breeze stirred the air. Finally, Brandon broke the silence. &#34;What&#39;s really going on between you and Charles?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie closed her eyes, exhaustion washing over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing between us,&#34; she said. &#34;I thought you&#39;d seen the statement online.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie knew Eugene would have kept him fully informed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So why was he here, making things even more difficult for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stance, she believed, was already abundantly clear-from ignoring his calls and texts to rejecting him outright at Moonlit Estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far off, Ari refused to leave without Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie, unwilling to prolong the argument,turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,&#34; Brandon said, reaching out to grab her hand. &#34;I still have questions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie sharply pulled her hand away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you-I&#39;m only here for Ari&#39;s check-up. She needs surgery,&#34; Millie said, her voice cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon stepped into her path, blocking the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari continued to watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dull throb crept into Millie&#39;s temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In a few days, I&#39;ll be at Babette&#39;s wine tasting. If you still have questions, ask me there,&#34; she said,locking eyes with him. &#34;Don&#39;t push me into hating you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,without waiting for a response, she moved past him and walked over to Ari and Giffard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon wanted to stop her, to say something-anything--but her words echoed relentlessly in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to watch them go, his emotions raging within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had things gotten this bad?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie could feel his eyes on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was Ari&#39;s frequent glances over her shoulder or thefaint tension in the air, Millie knew Brandon was still watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed and pushed the thought aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever this was, it wouldn&#39;t last. Once the divorce papers were finalized, they&#39;d be done-nothing left to tie them together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giffard observed them quietly, a swirl of emotions turning in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d seen the gossip about Millie and Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew Millie wasn&#39;t interested in Charles-not romantically. She never led people on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But being a man himself, Giffard could tell that Charles definitely had feelings for Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if he was being honest, a sliver of jealousy had taken root. He secretly hoped he could be by her side like Charles did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, he wished her happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze shifted to Ari, who had leaned her head against Millie&#39;s shoulder. Gently, he said,&#34;Ari,you&#39;ll come with me for your check-up now, okay? If anything feels off,just tell me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari turned and looked upo at him with wide, trusting eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Thank you,&#34; she replied softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The check-ups followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the tests were done, Millie took Ari home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They cooked dinner together, ate, and curled up on the sofa to watch cartoons. Ari love it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They watched until the sky turned dark. When it was time to send Ari back, the girl seemed hesitant throughout the drive, glancing at Millie over and over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie could see the question forming on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it, Ari?&#34; Millie asked, parking the car and turning to the girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari&#39;s voice was barely above a whisper. &#34;That man today... who was he? He seemed to know you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t answer right away. She looked into Ari&#39;s eyes, so big and earnest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, a breeze rustled the leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The streetlights cast a soft glow over passersby, their laughter drifting into the stillness of the car. It al felt strangely distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should she tell Ari the truth?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she nodded to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari would be living with her soon. The past wouldn&#39;t stay buried. Besides, Brandon might show up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Ari wasn&#39;t like most children-she understood more than people gave her credit for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Millie reached for her hand and said, &#34;He&#39;s my husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari blinked in surprise. &#34;But in nine days, we&#39;ll be officially divorced,&#34; Millie added gently. &#34;You don&#39;t have to worry about him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smoothed Ari&#39;s hair with a quiet sigh. &#34;Sometimes, we make mistakes. He was one of them. But I&#39;m doing my best to make things right, and I promise, he won&#39;t be a part of our lives. We&#39;re going to be okay.&#34;</p>
