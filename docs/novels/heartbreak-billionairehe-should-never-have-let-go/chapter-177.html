                <p>That day, Crobert&#39;s two most prominent business figures made headlines for very different reasons-one known for his philandering, the other admired for his quiet grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The top comment online read, &#34;Brandon should really learn from Myron.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s repoutation had hit rock bottom. Rumors swirled that the Flesta consortium was considering pulling out of its agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Public sentiment spiraled fast, and panic gripped the market. Shareholders rushed to place sell orders overnight,preparing to exit at the first sign of collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation seemed beyond repair. And yet,the city pulsed with quiet, unspoken tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dropping Ari off at the children&#39;s home, Myron drove Millie home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He considered walking her to her door but held back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t together yet, and until she gave the green light, it wouldn&#39;t be right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled warmly. &#34;Let&#39;s stick to what we discussed.We&#39;ll go over everything else tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded and waved as she stepped out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had already reached an understanding earlier that day at the Elliott Group&#39;s secret vault. Later, as they watched Ari played with the cat at his place, they went over their plans and prepared for what was ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tomorrow, once the market opened, Watson Group&#39;s stock would plummet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two outcomes were likely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One: the company&#39;s market value would nosedive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two: Watson Group would scramble to recover,prompting desperate countermeasures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Crobert&#39;s regulations were stricter than in many other places.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Actions had to follow the rules. The consequences for overstepping could be serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night,&#34; Myron said.&#34;I&#39;ll stay here and watch you go in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave a nod and entered the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she got inside the elevator,her emotions stirred-part anticipation, part uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ding!&#34; She reached her floor, stepped inside her apartment, and walked to the balcony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From there, she saw the Bentley still parked below.He was standing beside it, looking up at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m home,&#34; she texted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; he replied with a voice message, his tone soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t exchange more. He stayed there,gazing up. She stood above, looking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, he said, &#34;Go inside. The wind is picking up and it&#39;s cold on the balcony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after watching her disappear from view did he drive away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie remained by the window, watching until his car was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once,she had waited like this for Brandon. Night after night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt strangely comforting to be on the other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she washed her face, that thought stayed with her It grounded her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, sitting on the couch, she made a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles answered quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been dealing with rising tensions inside the Evans family.Since Serena had been revealed as Millie and Millie had won the championship, Heavenly Melody surged in popularity. Charles&#39; value had grown,which made Reuben and Oakley increasingly uneasy Trouble kept brewing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Millie,&#34; he said with a sigh, slumping onto his sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see the news today?&#34; she asked, turning on her TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t even bringit up,&#34; Charles grumbled. &#34;Brandon is unreal. So obsessed with Vivian. Why doesn&#39;t he just tattoo her name across his forehead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles had always been emotional and impulsive, but he was loyal. No matter what happened, he stood by his friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to his rant lightened her mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally paused, she changed the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need your help with something,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just say the word,&#34; Charles replied at once</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated for a second, and then explained,&#34;Tomorrow, I want you to watch the Evans family closely-especially Oakley&#39;s financial movements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why him?&#34; Charles asked. &#34;Oakley&#39;s involved in all sorts of things. He invests across the board, and he&#39;s never tried to hide it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. It&#39;s just one possibility I&#39;m watching. I&#39;LL explain later,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right. I&#39;ll keep an eye out,&#34; Charles said,sitting up.He knew Millie didn&#39;t act without reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was fed up with Oakley&#39;s scheming. Lately,it seemed like the man was constantly setting traps just for him. It was timne to strike back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles narrowed his eyes. &#34;Oakley, if you cross the line...&#34; he muttered to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, Millie reviewed her plans and notes before heading to bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sleep wouldn&#39;t come easily for many tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All over the city, different forces were on the move.Crobert&#39;s three major players were holding emergency meetings, and smaller groups were also maneuvering behind the scenes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon was wrapping up final communications,locking in agreements, and preparing contingency plans for the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if the stock price dropped, as long as partners stayed, the prenuptial terms held, and product quality remained, then Watson Group might still recover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scandal was personal. The foundation of the company was sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At dawn, Brandon stood by the window in his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rubbed his temples, drained. It had been along time since he felt this worn out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Millie was still around, he felt like he could do anything. No matter how hard the day, he believed things would turn out fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he could still do what needed to be done. But the spark was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t here. Neither was the coffee she used to make for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He closed his eyes. His right hand curled into a fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He told himself that she would come back.</p>
