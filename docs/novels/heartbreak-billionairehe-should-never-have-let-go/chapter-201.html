                <p>Millie was the star of the evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a long sip of wine, her heart light with satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She mingled and chatted, keeping the atmosphere warm and lively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The launch had gone well. It wasn&#39;t a final victory, not yet, but it was a strong beginning. That was enough to ease her mind for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dancing with Charles and Alexia, she made her way back to Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, Myron kept his eyes glued to Millie the entire time, occasionally glancing over to check on the little girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari, content in her seat, nibbled on snacks and chatted with Myron. &#34;Myron,&#34; she said, &#34;I&#39;m just like other kids now. Can I come visit your house more?want to see your cat.&#34; She looked at him with wide,hopeful eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Last time, Jayceon showed me a video of Kiki learning something new,&#34; she added. &#34;But I didn&#39;t get to watch it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron smiled and gently wiped crumbs from her mouth. &#34;Of course,&#34; he said warmly. &#34;If Millie says yes, I&#39;ll take you to see Kiki.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari turned to Millie with an eager look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari was slowly treating Millie like family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie felt a rush of warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out and gave Ari&#39;s cheek a gentle pinch.&#34;Of course you can, she said. &#34;If you want to see Kiki, just say so. Ari, we&#39;re family. You don&#39;t need to be polite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron nodded. &#34;I feel the same way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari&#39;s eyes lit up. She looked between them, and then broke into a bright smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay!&#34; she chirped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter filled the room. But elsewhere, the mood was different. Brandon and Vivian had just finished dinner.He was now driving her home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence between them was awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they reached her apartment, the car stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Vivian didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon,&#34; she said suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned his eyes slightly, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard from Eugene,&#34; she said. &#34;Watson Group has officially cut ties with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Brandon replied, eyes drifting to the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian looked at him. &#34;So that&#39;s it?&#34; she asked.&#34;You&#39;re just going to leave me like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t answer right away. He reached for a folder and handed it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian hesitated but then took it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke calmly. &#34;That film project carries too much risk. Watson Group can&#39;t afford it. Eugene found this instead. It&#39;s a better fit for you-and it works with your studio.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian glanced at the file. Then she tossed it aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want it,&#34; she said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon felt a headache building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t understand why Vivian was so attached to that project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was reckless but she seemed to be obsessed with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t need to understand-he just needed to get things done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Choose one,&#34; Brandon said. Vivian&#39;s expression darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you care about us?&#34; she snapped. &#34;Everything I&#39;m doing is for us, and our wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t respond. He kept his eyes forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s voice trembled. &#34;Are you disappointed in me because of Millie&#39;s success today?&#34; she asked. &#34;But you know Myron&#39;s helping her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s lips tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s eyes filled with tears. &#34;She&#39;s with someone else now,&#34; she said. &#34;But you still care more about her than me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice cracked. &#34;I know l act on impulse, but l really don&#39;t have much time left. I just want to marry you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears rolled down her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon looked at her for a long moment. Then he reached out and gently wiped her cheeks. &#34;There&#39;s no need to cry,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian clutched his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve divorced her,&#34; Brandon said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You love me, don&#39;t you?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t answer. His lips pressed into a tight line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Vivian, but saw Millie&#39;s face instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered her laughing with Myron. The image made something twist inside him. Jealousy hit him before he could stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when he realized it, he felt like he was losing his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The celebration had come to an end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron was driving Millie and Ari home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari gave them both a hug before heading inside the children&#39;s home. Millie watched her go, her heart stirred with the urge to finalize the adoption as soon as possible so she could be with Ari every single day. But she also knew she had to be patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright,&#34; Myron said gently, noticing her expression. &#34;I&#39;ve arranged for medical staff on standby. There&#39;s nothing to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood. But maybe the wine had made her a little emotional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver waited nearby, but Myron, sensing her mood, suggested, &#34;Let&#39;s walk for a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the soft streetlights, the trees cast long shadows across the sidewalk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two walked quietly. Myron stayed close, silently keeping pace beside her. After a while, he motioned for her to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your shoelace is untied,&#34; he said. Then he crouched down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie tried to stop him, but he was alreadly reaching for the laces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched as he tied her shoe, head bowed in concentration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was always something calm and steady about him. He gave the sense that nothing could shake him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari liked him too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The streetlight washed everything in warm gold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie knew he would be good to Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All done,&#34; he said, wiping his hands with a handkerchief before looking up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed in a half-kneeling position, meeting her eyes from below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then frowned slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to accept me for who l am. Not because of Ari.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lowered. He had read her thoughts again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached up and gently touched her face, lifting her gaze to his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still kneeling,he held her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to love me. I want you to accept me. Not because of Ari. Not because of a deal. Not because of anything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were steady and sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In your heart,&#34; he said, &#34;I want there to be room for me.For Myron Elliott.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A breeze moved softly through the trees. Millie looked down at him, the man still kneeling before her. In that quiet moment, her heart stirred like a leaf caught in the wind.</p>
