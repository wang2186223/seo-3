                <p>As Brandon drove home, his phone kept buzzing nonstop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he glanced at the screen and saw the caller ID,he felt a headache already forming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally picked up on the last ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma,&#34; he said, trying to sound calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you still remember you have a grandmother!&#34;Norma Watson, Brandon&#39;s grandmother, barked from the other end of the phone. &#34;What exactly is going on with that Vivian woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon pressed a palm against his temple.&#34;Vivian is sick. She&#39;s not trying to cause trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is not trying to cause trouble?&#34; Norma snapped.&#34;Can you hear yourself? She knows you&#39;re married and still hangs around you, playing the victim andacting like some noble mistress. I&#39;ve never seen anyone so bold and shameless. You need to end this mess and go apologize to Millie immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s jaw tightened. Millie&#39;s face crossed his mind, and something uncomfortable stirred in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Millie tell you anything?&#34; he asked, his voice hardening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does she even have to?&#34; Norma fired back. &#34;The entire Internet is talking about it! Brandon, Millie is your wife. You watched someone shove her to the ground while you stood there with another woman!You&#39;re embarrassing her in front of the whole world with those reporters watching!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon remembered that moment. Millie&#39;s face, the way she looked at him-hurt. Maybe he did make a mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he pushed the thought aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She saw the news and went to the hospital to makea scene. She did it on purpose, Grandma,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me speak to him,&#34; Derek Watson, Brandon&#39;s grandfather, said, taking the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon,&#34; Derek said firmly, &#34;you&#39;re the one who brought Millie home. You said you wanted to marry her. Now that you have, it&#39;s your duty to stand by her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa...&#34; Brandon began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come home for dinner tonight,&#34; Derek said, cutting him off. &#34;Bring Millie with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t wait for a reply before hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon sat there for a moment, his fingers tapping the steering wheel, a frown on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his contacts and scrolled until he found Millie&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stilI hadn&#39;t replied to the messages he&#39;d sent earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, he hit the call button.It rang for a while before she finally picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you busy?&#34; Brandon asked coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you calling?&#34; Millie replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon ran a hand over his face. &#34;Why did you go to the hospital today? Was it just to pick a fight with Vivian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; she said simply. &#34;I went to see Alexia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, don&#39;t lie to me,&#34; he snapped. The irritation in his voice returned quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But on the other end, there was only a quiet laugh-short, light, and far too calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It got under Brandon&#39;s skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, his grandfather&#39;s words echoed in his head. He had no choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come with me to visit my grandparents tonight,&#34; he finally said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m busy,&#34; Millie replied, her voice firm and final.&#34;It&#39;s my grandpa&#39;s order,&#34; Brandon said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t answer; she hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that remained was the dial tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stared at the screen, looking quite stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He called again, but she didn&#39;t pick up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept looking at the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, he set it aside, turned the key in the ignition, and drove home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky outside had started to dim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he arrived, he parked the car and walked straight into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entrance was dark when he stepped inside. His expression was unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie,&#34; Brandon called, his voice low and firm. But there was no answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did he realize that the entire house was in darkness.For a moment, Brandon stood still. Every time he came home, there was always at least one light left on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most nights, he&#39;d find Millie curled up on the sofa, a book slipping from her hand, the TV low in the background-half asleep while waiting for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He switched on the lights and looked over at the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, he had only been upset by Vivian&#39;s illness and frustrated by his grandfather&#39;s insistence that Millie show up for dinner. But now, the silence around him left him agitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flicked on every light in the house, room by room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living room, kitchen, bathroom. But there was no sign of Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t home. She wasn&#39;t answering her phone either.Where on earth was she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was how she wanted to act-throwing a fit over a divorce they both knew was just on paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d get over it. Vivian was temporary. Mllie was his wife, and that wouldn&#39;t change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, even if she was refusing to go with him to the Watson family mansion, he couldn&#39;t avoid the visit himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Brandon walked into the storage room and picked up some health supplements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there for a moment, and then make a detour to their bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In their bedroom, the familiar scent of Chanel No.5lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had bought it for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s shoulders loosened slightly.Grabbing a few changes of clothes, he walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t notice that the wardrobe no longer held both their clothes-only his. Or that the matching items they once shared now sat alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The space felt colder than it used to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at a beauty salon, Millie and Alexia were&#39;getting their nailsdone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had asked for pregnancy-safe products, and Alexia shook her head helplessly as she watched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said you&#39;d get rid of it,&#34; she said. &#34;But here you are,choosing nail polish made for pregnant women.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie smiled. &#34;Why not? It&#39;s still part of me for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia rolled her eyes and studied her own nails,pleased with how they sparkled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked down at hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon had a sensitive stomach. Since marryinghim,she&#39;d been cooking for him daily, so she hadn&#39;t done her nails in a longtime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever,&#34; Alexia said. &#34;This is at least a start. Once you&#39;re done with your nails, next is your hair,and then your wardrobe. I still remember when we were kids, sneaking around in our moms&#39; heels. There&#39;s no need to shrink back into someone you&#39;re not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held up her hands and smiled. &#34;Too bad I&#39;m a.doctor now. Can&#39;t go around looking like a disco ball.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was who she naturally was-bright, expressive,and full of color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had only changed for Brandon, having fallen in love with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, she thought real happiness was simple: to be with the man she loved, cook for him, raise their children, and grow old side by side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, it all seemed ridiculous.Luckily it wasn&#39;t too late to change things now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was ready to start again-this time on her own terms.</p>
