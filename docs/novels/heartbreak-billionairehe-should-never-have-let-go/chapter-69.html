            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Norma slipped away to check on Derek, leaving the young couple to their own devices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Side by side, Millie and Brandon made their way to the dining hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s purpose tonight was clear-she needed to set the record straight with Derek about the child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given her status as Brandon&#39;s wife, both by law and by title, the sudden appearance of a child demanded an honest explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she hadn&#39;t managed to say a word to him yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek was in no shape to listen just now, so she kept silent, biding her time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There would be another chance, maybe once Derek was feeling better and sought them out for answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their buggy rolled quietly toward the dining area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Millie and Brandon shared a ride, an invisible barrier stretched between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An air of stillness settled over the space, broken only by the moon&#39;s gentle glow as it shimmered across the lake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moonlit Estate boasted a collection of grand villas,each one reserved for a Watson family member.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek&#39;s residence stood at the heart of it all. Family meals usually took place in private quarters, but for special occasions of family gatherings or hosting guests, everyone converged at the famed floating restaurant over the Moon Lake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight was one such occasion-the entire family gathered above the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News of Brandon and Millie&#39;s return, combined with the online whispers about a mystery child, had piqued everyone&#39;s curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Brandon truly had an heir, no one could predict what new twists would ripple through the Watson family business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the buggy rolled to a gentle stop, Brandon stepped down first and extended his hand in Millie&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring his gesture, Millie slid out of the seat on her own,brushing past him without a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick nod from the butler signaled the all-clear,and Millie trailed Brandon into a striking, three-story structure defined by clean lines and modern glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the main floor gleamed under bright lights.Platters of food, champagne flutes, and delicate pastries lined the tables. At the heart of the room, a sunken pool sparkled with floating blooms while a harpist&#39;s music floated through the air, wrapping the scene in elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they walked in, a hush fell as curious eyes turned in their direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon!&#34; From across the room, a lively woman in a butter-yellow dress bounced over, barely past 25,with energy to spare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offering Millie a quick nod, she flashed Brandon a grin.&#34;It&#39;s been ages, Brandon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pair ofdimples deepened her smile, lending her a playful charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette Watson-Brandon&#39;s young cousin-had only just returned after years at an lvy League university overseas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good to see you again, Babette,&#34; Brandon replied,keeping his tone light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A server appeared, balancing a tray of drinks with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie reached for a champagne flute, nodded at Babette, and then moved to blend into the background, intent on finding a quiet spot to eat while waiting for Derek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could make it very far,Babette called out,halting her in her tracks, &#34;Millie, wait up! There&#39;s something I&#39;ve been dying to ask you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation struck Millie as strange. Babette, who&#39;d always kept her distance and acted superior before jetting off to Flesta, was now suddenly eager to chat?The change made no sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie paused, and then asked, &#34;What is it, Babette?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly glance at Brandon, then Babette&#39;s expression turned almost conspiratorial. &#34;I heard something interesting back at Flesta. For years, a powerhouse there held an iron grip on advanced tech-a barrier nobody else could crack. Then, out of nowhere,the Watson Group managed to shatter it, changing the entire industry landscape. Now, our firm and that conglomerate split the market between them, at home and overseas. Everyone says Brandon traveled to Flesta himself to close the deal. But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Admiration danced in Babette&#39;s eyes as she looked at Brandon, but the glance she gave Millie carried something different-something sharper, more curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s what really made waves,&#34; Babette continued,stepping closer. &#34;The wildest story wasn&#39;t about the business deal itself. Rumor had it that Egbert Perez,the infamous head of that conglomerate, had a reputation for trickery-walking away from contracts,toying his business partners. But with the Watson Group, it was different. Supposedly, the only reason he honored the contract was because he lost a bet.And the person who beat him? According to what I heard, that was you, Millie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s brow knit in concern, and in a protective move, he positioned himself between Millie and Babette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough, Babette,&#34; Brandon said, his voice sharp and unyielding</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A carefree laugh tumbled from Babette&#39;s lips. &#34;Relax,Brandon, we&#39;re just chatting,&#34; she teased. &#34;You wouldn&#39;t believe how often people cornered me about this story back in Flesta. Now that I finally get to meet Millie, I have to hear her side of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her focus shifted to Millie, her smile sly. &#34;So, Millie,what&#39;s your take? Everyone knows Watson Group cracked the code first and only then approached Mr.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perez. Why does the rumor mill spin such wild tales?Are my classmates simply gullible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled and added with a playful tilt of her head,&#34;Perez might be good-looking, but he&#39;s got the reputation of a shark. When he first hit the scene in Flesta, people said he was absolutely ruthless. How could he be tamed by something as trivial as losing a simple bet? There&#39;s even talk that losing to you changed him-that he went from a notorious troublemaker to the surprise contender who beat out his competition and took over the conglomerate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, her words sounded light, almost airy,but her gaze was trained on Millie, studying her lowered eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their little circle was clearly attracting attention by now and someone else joined them, approaching with quiet confidence. &#34;Alright, Babette. You said it yourself it&#39;s just idle gossip. Why dwell on it? Am I right,Brandon?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek&#39;s family tree had grown sprawling branches-three sons, two daughters. Brandon&#39;s father held the spot of second son, while Babette&#39;s father was the third.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casimir Watson, the youngest of Derek&#39;s eldest son&#39;s children, was the one speaking right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bright grin accompanied his raised champagne glass.&#34;Brandon, Millie,&#34; he said, pausing to join the gathering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounded as if he was stepping up for Millie, but beneath his polite tone, every word felt like a carefully disguised barb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking his side would be the same as admitting Millie had taken credit for the Watson family&#39;s achievements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, I&#39;m talking to Brandon, not you. Stay back,alright?&#34; Babette shot Casimir a withering look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no love lost between Babette and Casimir;they&#39;d clashed since childhood, even as she stayed on good terms with Brandon. Millie, however, had always rubbed her the wrong way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep dislike simmered beneath the surface whenever she thought about women clinging to Brandon for support. Still, if Brandon favored Millie,Babette saw no point in open hostility. At most, she&#39;d keep her distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, standing in front of her cousin, Babette kept things civil-a mark of Watson pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stories like these had chased her through both undergrad and grad school in Flesta, a constant hum of rumor and speculation. She&#39;d never paid much attention until one particular incident made it personal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the feeling lingered: resentment that Millie had snatched away some of the family&#39;s acclaim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,come on,Brandon! Let Millie answer for herself.&#34;A teasing smile curved Babette&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting her attention back to Millie, Babette continued, &#34;Millie,have you heard the latest? Word is,Mr.Perez is making his trip to Crobert.&#34;</p>
