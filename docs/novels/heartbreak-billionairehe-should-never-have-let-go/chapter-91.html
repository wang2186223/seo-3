                <p>Brandon almost told Ari the truth about who he was, but in the end, he held back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was here today for one reason only: to clear things up with Millie about Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want complications. That was the plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon caught the flicker of fear in Ari&#39;s wide eyes, her gaze dartingaround as if searching for an escape route. Before she could bolt, he quickly said, &#34;Don&#39;t be scared. I&#39;m not a bad person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, it was obvious she didn&#39;t want to stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I used to have a child,&#34; Brandon said, the words slipping out before he could stop them. An image flashed through his mind-Millie, soaked in blood and sobbing in his arms. &#34;But they&#39;re gone now.Seeing you just... reminds me of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean to scare you,&#34; he added gently.&#34;1only asked you to include me in the drawing because of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something must have shifted, because Ari stopped fidgeting. She looked up at him with surprising seriousness, no longer on the verge of running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,with a quiet kind of grace, she reached out and patted the back of his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tiny hand on his felt soft. It was very comforting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon almost chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little girl comforting him? But the strange thing was, it worked. He actually felt a bit better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she spoke. &#34;But | still can&#39;t draw you in. I have my rules.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rules? What did such a small child know about rules?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon raised an eyebrow, more intrigued than annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did your mom teach you that?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari turned back to her drawing, carefully filling in the colors. Without looking up, she replied,&#34;My mom taught me a lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you haven&#39;t known her long, have you?&#34; Brandon asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari didn&#39;t seem to mind the question. &#34;She&#39;s nice to everyone. Not just me-Charles, Alexia too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face lit up. &#34;Even though I don&#39;t call her &#39;Mom&#39; out loud yet, she gets me. She takes me to the doctor, buys me things, lets me go to school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then her expression tightened with concern. &#34;She doesn&#39;t take care of herself, though. Her injuries aren&#39;t better yet. But I kiss them, and she says it helps. My mom says when I kiss her booboos, they stop hurting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s thoughts immediately jumped to Millie...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head was wrapped in bandages when he saw her at the hospital last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d fallen down the stairs. He wondered how bad her injuries were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During their recent visit to the Moonlit Estate, he hadn&#39;t gotten a chance to check on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A light breeze passed as he watched Ari color with impressive focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon found a quiet sense of peace settling over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This,he thought, was nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time drifted by. Then, in the distance, he spotted Millie approaching the kindergarten</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, he stepped back into the shade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Millie entered the school yard, she spotted Ari perched on a stone bench, completely absorbed in her drawing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just seeing her brought a smile to Millie&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked over quietly, not wanting to interrupt. But Ari noticed her anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie!&#34; she squealed joyfully, running straight into her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie caught her with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just finished a drawing!&#34; Ari said eagerly,holding it out. &#34;Do you like it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie took the paper and examined it with a warm smile. &#34;It&#39;s beautiful, Ari. You did a wonderful job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kissed Ari on the cheek, making the girl giggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carefully, Millie rolled up the drawing and set it aside. She then sat beside Ari, gently brushing her fingers over Ari&#39;s forehead and cradling her small hands in hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled out a wet wipe, cleaning Ari&#39;s face and fingers, and then opened a thermos and poured her some warm water, using the lid as a temporary cup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her every motion was thoughtful and tender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Ari said after finishing her drink, passing back the lid with both hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome. Want some more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari nodded, and Millie poured another cup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she helped Ari retie her loosened ponytail and adjust her shoelaces, she asked how her day at kindergarten had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari had plenty to say. They both seemed to be enjoying the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, Brandon watched quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he and Millie had a chid...would their life look something just like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would they walk hand-in-hand as a family of three?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt a sudden ache in his chest. Was he getting old, longing for this kind of domestic life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Ari piped up, &#34;Right, a stranger said he wanted to buy me ice cream earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stiffened slightly. &#34;Who was it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari looked around and then pointed. &#34;He was over there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following her gaze, Millie spotted Brandon, no longer hiding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes locked. Millie straightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stepped forward, his voice steady. &#34;We need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie turned her attention to Ari, who was still watching them curiously from the stone bench.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ari has a hospital appointment,&#34; Millie said coolly, making it clear she didn&#39;t intend to linger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;Il go with you,&#34; Brandon replied, giving her no room to decline. &#34;Unless you want me showing up here every day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips pressed into a thin line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked back at Ari. Then, with a resigned sigh, she nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Better to deal with him now than let this drag on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari continued to observe the two adults, her eyes full of questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to explain. She didn&#39;t want Ari calling Brandon&#34;Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes,they were still legally married-but not for much longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, she helped Ari into the back seat of Brandon&#39;s Maybach and got in beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car glided smoothly toward Crobert Hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence hung heavy inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon glanced at Millie in the rearview mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had things grown so cold between them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She used to have that dazzling smile on her face whenever she saw him. Now, she wouldn&#39;t even look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He broke the silence. &#34;When did you move out? And why didn&#39;t you tell me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie kept her eyes on Ari, who leaned quietly against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to know,&#34; she replied, her tone calm but distant</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon clenched his jaw but held back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you staying now?&#34; he asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still no answer. Millie gently rubbed Ari&#39;s back. After a longpause, she finally said, &#34;We&#39;ll talk after Ari&#39;s hospital appointment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie!&#34; he started, his voice rising with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari suddenly burst into tears. Big, silent sobs that spilled down her cheeks. &#34;He&#39;s scary,&#34; she cried.Millie&#39;s patience snapped upon seeing Ari&#39;s tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop the car,&#34; she said, her voice icy.</p>
