            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t dwell on much-she focused on her food,occasionally chatting with Giffard about memories from their childhood or Ari&#39;s upcoming surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Brandon sat in his office with his eyes closed, trying to ignore the dull ache in his stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far from him, Eugene finished his second meal and let out a loud, satisfied burp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day passed quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the markets closed, Watson Group hadn&#39;t been hit with any major drama. That alone made the day feel calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though their stock was still dipping, most people felt things would bounce back in no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone agreed on one thing-Watson Group had strong,reliable tech. That was their real backbone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as there weren&#39;t any new disasters, the market would regain confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus, a new product line was on the way. Watson Group never released anything unimpressive, and the anticipation alone would be enough to nudge the stock upwards again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later on, Eugene helped Vivian double-check that she hadn&#39;t bought any Watson Group shares, which gave Brandon a small moment of peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, even after the official announcement denying that Vivian&#39;s livestream was tied to the company,no one really bought it. Too many rumors had linked her to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a result, the company&#39;s public image had taken a serious hit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People in the industry whispered and mocked behind closed doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those jabs weren&#39;t online or broadcasted-they were private, quiet, and brutal. Enough to leave a permanent dent in Brandon&#39;s pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Millie-her face kept flashing through his mind.His head felt like it might explode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was before Derek and Norma barged in. Derek didn&#39;t even bother with words at first-he raised his cane and landed a few sharp whacks on Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at the nonsense that Vivian&#39;s stirred up!&#34; Derek shouted. &#34;Millie was with this company for seven years.Seven! And she never caused a scene-she cleaned up after others! But this Vivian-she&#39;s not even part of the company and has already dragged its name through the dirt. My friends are calling to ask if I&#39;ve lost my mind.Some even told me to get checked for brain damage. You&#39;ve shamed the Watson name,Brandon! Open your eyes and see that girl for who she is!&#34; Derek unleashed his anger without restraint,scolding Brandon right there in front of everyone like it was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swung his cane over and over like Brandon&#39;s image meaning nothing to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it wasn&#39;t just Derek. The major shareholders were clearly fed up, and the foreign partners didn&#39;t bother hiding their disdain either-Egbert, especially, was ruthless in his criticism. &#34;I came yesterday to scare you a little,&#34; he said, &#34;but Brandon, your handling of all this is embarrassing. Thank God Millie left when she did-at least she doesn&#39;t have to share this disgrace.Oh,right. Maybe it&#39;s because she left that we&#39;re seeing the real you now. It all makes sense-Millie must&#39;ve been the one covering for you. She&#39;s the reason you&#39;ve made it this far. Now that she&#39;s out of the picture,you&#39;ve crumbled like paper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Darden chimed in, sending Brandon a sarcastic meme.He didn&#39;t say much, but the message was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was blow after blow. Brandon hadn&#39;t been hit this hard even when Millie slapped him in public or when Egbert&#39;s unexpected visit caught him off guard</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was worse. It burned deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, that day,he left the office early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when they drove past the mall, he suddenly asked the driver to pull over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered the puppy plushie Ari really adored and always carried with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that in mind, Brandon stepped out of the car and walked into the mall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wondered if she liked anything else from that cartoon series-maybe something with sparkles. Little girls always liked sparkling things, didn&#39;t they?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he browsed through rows of plush toys, one caught his eye. It was a huge, soft-looking puppy plushie-way bigger than the one Ari had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he reached for it, another hand got there first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon looked up. Myron. He was smiling as he picked up the plush toy like he&#39;d just won a prize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he noticed Brandon, Myron gave a nod.&#34;Brandon, you&#39;re here too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave a nod back. He remembered what Darden had mentioned recently-some gossip about Myron dating a mystery woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had made headlines the same day Brandon&#39;s name hit the top of the scumbag list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron didn&#39;t say much. He just glanced around and spotted something behind Brandon. &#34;Excuse me,could you move?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stepped aside without saying a word and watched him pick up a hat with cute puppy ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| heard you&#39;re chasing a woman,&#34; Brandon said,without really thinking</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron adjusted the things in his hands and smiled.&#34;Yeah. She has a daughter who loves these. Cute little girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stared at him.it worth it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron didn&#39;t go looking for anything else. He just smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both knew what Brandon meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Myron&#39;s status, he could easily choose someone younger, someone from a respected family. Not a woman with a child. Not someone carrying another man&#39;s name in her past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really like her,&#34; Myron said after a few seconds. &#34;I want her so badly, it messes with my sleep at night.She used to be married, and her heart was full of another man. But that&#39;s okay. I waited. I&#39;ve been waiting for a long time, like a shadow just out of sight,watching quietly. Now, I finally have my chance. Her ex didn&#39;t treasure her, and really, I should thank him.He gave me this chance. She&#39;s divorced now, so I can finally chase her as openly as I want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon frowned slightly. Myron still had that calm,gentlemanly smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t get it,&#34; Brandon said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; Myron replied. His voice stayed even, but there was something intense in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you&#39;ve never known what it means to ache for someone you can&#39;t have, never carried the sharp weight of wanting, never been swallowed by that slow,burning madness called jealousy. Everything came easy to you. So of course, you wouldn&#39;t understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron raised the items slightly. &#34;I&#39;ve thought everything through, step by step. And finally, she&#39;s warming up to me. She hasn&#39;t accepted me or my</p>
                
                
                
                <p>feelings yet, but her daughter likes me. She even likes my cat. That&#39;s a good start and enough to keep me going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s eyes dropped to the plushie in Myron&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had come here to buy that exact toy-for Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The little girl Myron mentioned also liked that same cartoon character?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon shot Myron a curious look, but Myron was already looking down, tapping at his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he held the screen up for Brandon to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On it was the latest trending entertainment headline -#MillieVivianBetAgreement</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leaked document showed the agreement Derek had handed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s section had been blurred. But Vivian&#39;s part was clear-it said if she outperformed Millie, she&#39;d officially become Brandon&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Internet was already in chaos.</p>
