                <p>The live broadcast of Heavenly Melody was in full swing, and the audience seats were quickly filling up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few rows from Brandon, Myron, Jayceon, and Adriana had already taken their seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three were chatting, their voices low, but bits of their conversation drifted over to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myron, come on! That perfect gentleman charade? Just drop it! What if she&#39;s not into that?&#34; Jayceon teased, though it wasn&#39;t cear who they were talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He added, &#34;You know her type isn&#39;t exactly what you&#39;repretending to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron replied smoothly, &#34;And how do you know I&#39;m not a real gentleman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon made a dramatic gagging sound and threw his sister a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adriana rolled her eyes at Myron. &#34;Please. You? A real gentleman? You&#39;re a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon sighed. &#34;Exactly. And don&#39;t forget you dragged me along as your perfect excuse when you were the one desperately wanted to see her. You said youhad a plan, but I bet your whole plan is just scheming how to win her over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adriana nodded in agreement and pointed at Myron. &#34;You&#39;re no gentleman at all. One day, I&#39;ll tell her the truth about you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron only chuckled, calm and unfazed, as if he had everything under control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon looked over at them and found Myron staring right back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning into his seat with ease, Myron turned his head slightly and gave Brandon a small, deliberate nod-like he had sensed Brandon&#39;s eyes on him all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon returned the nod quietly and then looked away. But something about it lingered in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who were the Elliott siblings talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounded like Myron had his eye on someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That didn&#39;t happen often.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever it was must be someone special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon glanced at the empty seat next to him and picked up his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The show&#39;s about to start. You should get here soon, or you&#39;ll miss it,&#34; he texted Millie. But just like before,there was no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s brows creased slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far away, Jayceon and Adriana were exchanging glances, clearly up to something. They kept gesturing between Brandon and Myron, whispering and nudging each other like kids sharing a secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Myron cleared his throat, and the two instantly straightened up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Vivian was watching closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes kept returning to the empty seat beside Brandon. Seeing it still unoccupied, she clenched her fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon had told her he was inviting Millie. He&#39;d even said that if it made Vivian uncomfortable, he would seat Millie among the general audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to keep up her image of being&#34;sweet and understandinVivian had insisted he sit Millie nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still care for each other, even if you&#39;re divorced,&#34; Vivian had said with a pale smile. &#34;Besides... I don&#39;t have much time left. In the future, she&#39;ll still be the one beside you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now-Vivian looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, you better not show up... Or I&#39;ll teach you a lesson you&#39;ll never forget,&#34; she whispered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, as if struck by a thought, she turned and walked toward the host.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As more time passed, the show officially began?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&lt;</p>
