                <p>The first bid for the tanzanite came from paddle number 888.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian might&#39;ve been the one holding it, but that paddle belonged to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s attention drifted toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she wasn&#39;t the only one. Nearly every head had turned in Vivian&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the second flooroffered privacy for guests that needed privacy, the layout let guests choose whether to be seen or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had opted for the spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon remained in the dim section behind her.From the first floor, people could barely make out his silhouette,let alone his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles knew well the tanzanite was donated by Millie since he handled it for her. He also knew exactly why she&#39;d decided to part with it. The moment he spotted Vivian making a bid, rage surged in him. He nearly rose from his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s stare sharpened on Vivian, who still wore that pleasant little smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had every intention of selling the tanzanite and donating to charity tonight, but she would&#39;ve handed it to a stranger off the street before letting Vivian have it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his seat, Brandon watched Vivian lift the paddle again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You like it?&#34; he asked quietly, voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian responded with a small nod, her smile unchanged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t follow up. His gaze returned to the dazzling tanzanite beneath the gallery lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recognized the tanzanite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie and he had come across it together in early March.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, they&#39;d just endured another long lunch with his grandparents, who once again asked when they planned to have children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While heading back to their mansion, they drove past Crobert&#39;s biggest jewelry store in his Aston Martin. The gem had been displayed right there in the front window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The March evening was cold, but the inside of the car felt comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered Millie watching the gem a little longer than usual. He&#39;d asked her the same thing he asked Vivian tonight. &#34;You like it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d smiled faintly and said, &#34;I was just thinking... if we conceive a baby now, the due date would be in Decemnber. And December&#39;s birthstones are tanzanite and turquoise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she added, &#34;So it&#39;s kind of funny that we saw tanzanite now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d looked at the stone again and asked,&#34;Birthstones? Do they mean anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apparently, tanzanite represents love and eternity.Turquoise is supposed to bring victory and success,&#34;Millie had replied. &#34;If I had to choose, I&#39;d go with tanzanite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d turned to him, her smile softer. &#34;Because I&#39;d want to tell our child their parents will always love them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had raised an eyebrow and teased. &#34;I&#39;ll go with turquoise then. I just want our kid to be successful.Always winning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t appreciated that. He had tried to smooth things over. &#34;Either way, our kid deserves the best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she hadn&#39;t cared about any of that. When he offered to buy the tanzanite, she got annoyed. So he dropped the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had driven home in silence, but the tension melted away once the car stopped. From the car to the bedroom, they didn&#39;t speak much. What followed was breathless and fiery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could still see it clearly-the way she moved, the heat of her skin, the scent that lingered on her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that small mole just above her chest, he&#39;d always been fond of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon shut his eyes. His throat tightened. He picked up his glass and drank slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who had ended up buying that tanzanite? And how had it found its way here,to this charity auction?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the weight in his chest began to settle, a hand reached forward from the seat beside him. Nails painted a shade like pale moonlight curled around a bidding paddle-elegant, deliberate,and quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Following bidder 888&#39;s offer, bidder 823 has entered at nine hundred thousand dollars!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Brandon and Vivian turned their heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The seat,the hand holding the paddle-it could only be Serena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, the entire room stirred again.Conversations broke out across the villa, the atmosphere thick with curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon hasn&#39;t attended a charity auction in person in two years, and this is his first bid tonight. For something like that, who&#39;d be foolish enough to go up against him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. The tanzanite looks good, sure, but it&#39;s not some one-of-a-kind treasure. I wouldn&#39;t bother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same here. If it were a blue diamond, I might&#39;ve raised my hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought it was Vivian who placed the bid, not Brandon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It makes no difference. She used Brandon&#39;s paddle,and he let her. That counts just the same.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads nodded around the room. That was how things worked in their world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless an item was rare or symbolic, deference was expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I checked. The second one placing the bid is the woman Charles came with-name&#39;s Serena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This new piece of information sent a ripple through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this about? Is Charles trying to provoke Brandon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hard to say. Charles has always been erratic. No telling what he&#39;s thinking now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the other guests murmured and guessed, Oakley was also on the second floor, laughing so hard he had to brace himself against the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Charles really is an idiot. Grandpa&#39;s already furious with him, and now this? He&#39;s digging his own grave.I won&#39;t even have to lift a hand, he&#39;ll take care of himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Near the back, another man sat quietly in the shadows.He said nothing, simply swirled the wine in his glass before taking a measured sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Vivian could hardly believe someone had dared to challenge her bid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was all part of her strategy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t planned to compete for anything extravagant or meaningless. Just something in between, enough to leave a mark without seeming excessive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tanzanite fit that goal perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could easily say it was a playful gesture to use Brandon&#39;s paddle, but she&#39;d use her own money since she wanted to contribute to charity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After tonight, this tanzanite would be their symbol,something to mark her connection with Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, whatever she spent now, he&#39;d make it up to her later. He always did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not to mention, the attention online alone would bring her a decent return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was their first bid of the night. According to the usual unspoken rules, that should&#39;ve been enough for others to step back. She&#39;d even bumped the price by an extra hundred thousand, making it eight hundred thousand. She never imagined Serena would respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whose decision was it? Did Serena act on her own?Or was Charles behind it? Were they testing her?Trying to stir trouble? Or were they aiming at Brandon?For what reason though?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no answers. And now, she wasn&#39;t sure if she should go in again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gem&#39;s value sat around a million. Her limit was 1.2million. Beyond that, it just wasn&#39;t worthit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Vivian weighed her options, the auctioneer carried on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He called out, asking if anyone else wanted to place a bid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a second&#39;s pause, Vivian lifted the paddle again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t believe Serena would keep pushing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bidder number 888 has returned with a bid of one million dollars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of voices moved through the audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They increased the bid again. They must really want it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will 823 follow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes turned toward Millie&#39;s section.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the auctioneer could say more, Millie lifted her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bidder 823 has placed a new bid-one point one million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian gritted her teeth and scribbled down another bid.She couldn&#39;t lose.</p>
