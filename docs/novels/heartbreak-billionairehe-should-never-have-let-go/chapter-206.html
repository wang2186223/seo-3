                <p>Time seemed to slip away without notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was time for Millie and Myron&#39;s third date.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, they met on a small island just fifteen minutes from Crobert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The island often hosted public events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In recent days, there had been a steady stream of activity, sparking curiosity about what was taking place there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Millie had heard the rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when Myron picked her up, she finally understood. Everything happening on the island had been planned for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they boarded the boat, she glanced at him and asked, &#34;Isn&#39;t this a bit extravagant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled. &#34;It&#39;s not just the two of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That only deepened her curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They set off at dusk. The sun hung low, casting crimson light across the water. Fifteen minutes later,they arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked a short distance and turned a corner.What Millie saw left her speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The street ahead looked likesomething from a dream. Crystals lined the path. Smoke from the burning exotic herbs and spices floated in the air, its scent rich and mysterious. All kinds of strange and beautiful sights surrounded them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just past the entrance, something caught Millie&#39;s eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man in a wizard&#39;s robe stood beneath a lantern. He performed tricks with ease, pulling objects from nowhere. At one point, a glowing ring appeared in his hand, and with a flick, it turned into several balloons tied on a string.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie watched closely, trying to see how he did it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could figure it out, he bowed and handed her the balloons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Myron, only to realize he had vanished while she was distracted by the magic show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The string of balloons was already in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent of herbs and spices drifted closer. From a nearby window, a stream of bubbles floated out,surrounding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the glow of the setting sun, the scene felt like something out of a fairy tale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding the string of balloons in one hand, Millie reached out with the other to poke the colorful bubbles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One large bubble, wrapped in several smaller ones,burst softly. A man appeared where it had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore a black suit and a half-mask. White gloves covered his hands, and he held a top hat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned the hat upside down and showed her that it was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he had her attention, he reached toward her shoulder, pulled something invisible from the air,and dropped it into the hat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, he lifted out a white dove. Its wings flapped against the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow,&#34; Millie whispered. She had seen the hat was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man placed the dove gently on her shoulder.It settled there without fear and began to co0.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved slightly, but it didn&#39;t fly away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a sharp snap of fingers made her turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The magician smiled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again, he turned the hat over and showed it was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, he reached toward her other shoulder and repeated the motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dug into the hat, moving his hand as though searching for something hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft breeze passed through. Bubbles drifted by in its wake. From inside the hat, he pulled out a half-mask. It sparkled with colorful gems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tipped the hat once more. Petals spilled out and floated to the ground. Then he bowed and offered the mask to Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated for a moment, but then took it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he straightened, another snap of fingers brought forth a folded paper. It appeared on his chest and fluttered in place. She read the words,&#34;Would you wear it for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The handwriting was familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at the figure before her and smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; she said softly, placing the mask over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man watched her, his eyes warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the mask was in place, he removed the paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick ofhis hand, the paper caught fire. Its glow lit up Millie&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the flames vanished, a red rose appeared in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bowed again and offered it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rose glowed in the soft light. Its scent mingled perfectly with the herbs and spices. Around them,bubbles shimmered, and the dove cooed gently on her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at the rose. Something about the moment felt familiar, as though she had seen it before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could you accept it?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie smiled, shaking off the strange feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took the rose, still wondering how he had made it appear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he extended his right hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My dear lady, may I have the pleasure of showing you around the island?&#34; It was Myron&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Certainly,&#34; she replied, ready to take his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But one of her hands held the rose, and the other held the balloons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at the balloons. She understood and released the string.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They floated upward. He took her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met, both smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He led her into the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun had dipped below the horizon. The island shifted intonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their first stop was a boutique known for its detailed designs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they arrived, a staff member stepped forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Bennett?&#34; the woman said with a smile.&#34;Please come with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie glanced at Myron. He nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She followed the staff member inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They dressed her in a gown covered in gemstones.It matched the half-mask perfectly. The woman in the mirror looked radiant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Millie stepped outside, the magician was gone,but a man stood waiting. His clothes matched hers perfectly.</p>

                <p>Now the island shimmered with unusual lights.Lamps glowed beside trails of floating smoke. They flickered like stars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If viewed from the sky, the lights would spell out one name.Millie.</p>
