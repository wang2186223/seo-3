                <p>Minutes dragged on in a slow parade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the morning, Millie was already setting the stage for Elliott Group&#39;s newest launch event, the Golden series.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bright sunflowers transformed the street, filling the space with energy and joy as sunlight poured over their bright yellow petals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nestled among these blossoms, a delicate pathway curved around a stream of shimmering gold that never stopped flowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Designers had outdone themselves with that thoughtful detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameras clicked as Millie stepped forward, her smile as radiant as the display itself. She greeted the crowd.&#34;This river represents time. Some says time slips away like a river, always moving and always changing. But this one flows differently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused expressions rippled through the audience as her words hung in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eager to clear things up, she continued, &#34;Let&#39;s invite some of you to join us, and you&#39;ll see what I mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie waved to the staff, who began.selecting volunteers from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement quickly bubbled up as someone cried out, &#34;Vivian&#39;s just gone live!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another voice called, &#34;Where is she right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone else chimed in, &#34;Look at that place! That villa is stunning!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight frown crossed Millie&#39;s face as she glanced toward the uproar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was supposed to be lying low, claiming she needed time to rest before her big broadcast debut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite that, Charles had mentioned to Millie that Vivian&#39;s first stream would take place at Darden&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had come to know Darden fairly well over the years since he was one of Brandon&#39;s close fríends. Also,there was a shop assistant at Elliott Group&#39;s store named Alyssa Hammond, who people said used to date him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was right-Alyssa and Darden had broken up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long ago, Millie had watched Alyssa stand her ground against Darden during a heated exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still admired how Alyssa handled the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But hang on, wasn&#39;t Vivian supposed to stream from Darden&#39;s villa? This doesn&#39;t look like it. Isn&#39;t this Brandon&#39;s place?&#34; someone wondered aloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s thoughts scattered as a different voice piped up., this isn&#39;t Darden&#39;s. That looks exactly like the house Millie and Brandon moved into after they tied the knot!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush fell as everyone turned their attention to Millie,who was at the heart of the launch event and the mind behind the new product.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surprise wasn&#39;t limited to the people present. Online viewers began buzzing too, flooding the chat with questions and comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Social media platforms erupted with gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of the expected venue, Vivian had chosen an extravagant mansion tucked away in the hills for her live broadcast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luxury was everywhere in that villa-a sprawling courtyard, high on the hillside, offering a breathtaking view of the city&#39;s twinkling lghts at night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It did not take long for eagle-eyed viewers to figure out exactly where she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Vivian stepped inside, cameras caught a glimpse of Millie and Brandon&#39;s wedding portrait displayed proudly on the far wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That alone settled any doubts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable, she&#39;s really there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did Vivian manage to get into that house?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Picture this: while Millie leads another Elliott Group&#39;s major product launch event, Vivian&#39;s over here streaming her first luxury flower showcase inside Millie and Brandon&#39;s home!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who let her through the door? Was it Brandon himself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Brandon truly cared about Millie, why would he let Vivian do this and even leave their wedding photo up for the world to see?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This drama is too good, I have to see Millie&#39;s reaction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word spread like wildfire, and Eugene was alerted almost immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, Derek called Eugene into the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eugene, what&#39;s going on over there?!&#34; Derek&#39;s words came out sharp with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Eugene replied, &#34;Mr. Watson, I&#39;m stilI looking into it. Miss Simpson was supposed to be streaming from Darden&#39;s place. Somehow, it&#39;s ended up at Serenity Villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want answers now! And get Vivian out of that house,right away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek&#39;s rage was written all over his face, cheeks turning crimson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calls to Brandon went unanswered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene did his best to explain,&#34;Mr. Watson left for Proidan at the crack of dawn to handle a work emergency. I think he&#39;s still dealing with that mess, so he probably doesn&#39;t have cell service.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe the poor signal out there was why Brandon hadn&#39;t picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek snapped,∵Gt Darden on the phone, right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several rings later,Darden finally picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hangover still lingering, he shuffled groggily toward the bathroom, completely oblivious to the chaos that had erupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh? What&#39;s going on?&#34; He swayed with each step, fumbling his way toward the bathroom as if the floor shifted beneath him. &#34;Yeah, Brandon told me Vivian would use my place for her stream. She didn&#39;t show up?Where did she end up? Wait, she&#39;s at Brandon and Millie&#39;s house? This is a disaster!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sudden panic wiped away Darden&#39;s drowsiness. He splashed water on his face, threw on his clothes, and dashed outside in a rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phone pressed to his ear, he called his villa staff while running to his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Somebody tell me what&#39;s going on over there!&#34; Darden yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of his employees answered right away,&#34;Mr. Harris, we had a busted pipe. Water flooded the whole villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miss Simpson&#39;s crew said the broadcast couldn&#39;t go forward, so everyoneleft.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief gave way to exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable!&#34; Darden murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ending the call, Darden jumped behind the wheel and tore off in the direction of Serenity Villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the Internet, the story only gained momnentum. Back at the Elliott Group event, crowds swelled, and the noise was overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity focused on Millie, who stood right in the thick of the excitement while people crowded closer and snapped photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crowd had their cameras raised, snapping pictures and recording Millie, their eyes fixed on her, waiting to catch every flicker of her reaction.

                <p>She cut him off.&#34;Let me go first, Myron. I already know what&#39;s going on with Vivian. I&#39;ll take care of the fallout, but before that, I need to ask you something. Is it alright if I bring up that other matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quietly, she shared her plan with Myron and waited for his answer.</p>
