                <p>The night stretched on, thick with unspoken tensions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at her apartment, Millie rinsed off the day&#39;s exhaustion and slipped into a loose nightgown. She drifted onto the balcony, letting the mild May air cool her damp skin and tangle gently through her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone screen lit up, snapping her out of her reverie. A new message flashed on the display. &#34;This is Myron Elliott and here&#39;s my number. Please save it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wording was so stiff, so formal, she could practically see him hunched over his desk, pecking at each word like he was composing an official memo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, this wasn&#39;t the message she&#39;d been waiting for -not tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few quiet minutes slipped by before her phone buzzed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette&#39;s name appeared on the caller ID.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie hesitated, thumb hovering, before finally picking up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; she asked, her voice soft but wary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette&#39;s voice crackled with anger. &#34;Millie,Brandon&#39;s in the hospital-he&#39;s sick and all alone.Don&#39;t you even care enough to visit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint crease formed between Millie&#39;s brows. &#34;Didn&#39;t he mention anything to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette&#39;s irritation flared. &#34;Mention what? Stop dodging.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie hesitated, Derek&#39;s face briefly flickering through her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing,&#34; she said, her voice flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon probably just needed time before breaking the news of their divorce to the Watson family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek had shown her nothing but kindness throughout that doomed marriage, so she&#39;d leave it to Brandon to explain. But if he dragged it out, she certainly wouldn&#39;t cover for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie,you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie cut in before Babette could get the words out,&#34;I already know he&#39;s sick. That&#39;s enough. I have things to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, she ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t about to sit and take the blame for someone else&#39;s mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie ignored the persistent ring of her phone and,with a swipe of her finger, blocked Babette&#39;s number,effectively muting her latest attempt to get through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling back on the long chaise lounge, she let her gaze wander across the glittering city skyline, where windows burned with a thousand stories and the traffic below hummed on, undaunted by the late hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how deep into the night it was,this city never truly slept-its lights blazed, restless as her own thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, the phone shuddered in her hand again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time the caller ID flashed Derek&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie drew in a steadying breath, squared her shoulders, and answered with a warmth she hoped sounded effortless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Derek.&#34; She greeted him softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie,&#34; he responded with a heaviness she could feel even through the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek&#39;s voice was rough with fatigue, the exhaustion in it unmistakable. For a long moment, he just breathed-then, with a weary sigh, he finally asked,&#34;What&#39;s really going on between you and Brandon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie hesitated, at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek&#39;s voice, sharp with anger, broke the silence.&#34;know you&#39;re furious about Brandon and Vivian!&#34; He practically spat Vivian&#39;s name. &#34;Norma&#39;s already decided she&#39;ll handle Vivian herself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An older woman&#39;s voice cut in from nearby--firm,unmistakably Norma. &#34;Millie, we gave that fool a chance to fix things on his own, but it&#39;s clear he&#39;s hopeless! I&#39;ll have a word with Vivian myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knot of emotion twisted in Millie&#39;s chest-part gratitude, part resignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her marriage to Brandon was over, and she had no plans to turn back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever happened between Brandon and Vivian had nothing to do with her anymore, so Norma really didn&#39;t have to get involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a steady breath. &#34;There&#39;s really no need.&#34;&#34;Millie...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon still has things he hasn&#39;t told you,&#34; Millie remarked gently, her tone measured. &#34;There are Derek went quiet for a beat, nis voice returning, low and searching. &#34;Millie, is there something going on between the two of you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie lifted her eyes to the scattered city lights,weighing her words. &#34;It&#39;s nothing major-just something he should explain to you himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, Brandon had led her to Derek&#39;s bedside during a health crisis; now, she felt it was only right for Brandon to face Derek on his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a faint sigh. &#34;I&#39;m a little tired tonight. I think I&#39;ll turn in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cutting off any chance for more questions,Millie said a quick goodnight and ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie unlocked her phone and found a video of a cat doing an energetic backflip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following that, a message read, &#34;My cat can do a backflip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MAillie let out a soft chuckle. &#34;Childish,&#34; she muttered,tossed her phone onto the nightstand and then settled into bed, ready for sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the Elliott Mansion, Jayceon sat on the carpet, coaxing Myron&#39;s ragdoll cat with treats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Show us your acrobatic moves, superstar!&#34; he insisted eagerly. &#34;Let&#39;s see it again-come on, just one more backflip!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the cat, thoroughly unimpressed, stretched languidly and sauntered off, leaping straight into Myron&#39;s waiting lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s eyes softened as he scratched under the cat&#39;s chin, earning a deep, satisfied purr.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the days that followed, a whirlwind of events shook up the online world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fallout between Millie and Brandon exploded across social media, their names plastered everywhere as the story went viral overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By morning, a brand-new headline had already stolen the spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s latest series was suddenly everywhere-a show loosely inspired by &#34;Glimmer of Love,&#34; though the title had been slyly tweaked to &#34;Love of Vivian&#34;for promotion purpose, swapping in her own name for maximum buzz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The series spun a bittersweet tale: two strangers drawn together by fate, swept into a romance, only for tragedy to strike when one of them fell gravely ill and died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trailer set the Internet abuzz. In one poignant scene, the heroine recorded a demo in the studio,pouring her feelings into every note, while the male lead listened silently in the next room, completely captivated yet unable to confess his feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, that very same demo echoed hauntingly as the female lead died in his arms, the music stirring up memories of their lost happiness and driving the heartbreak home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within hours, the trailer had gone viral. Viewers swarmed to comment sections, hungry for fresh gossip and already debating the love story&#39;s twists and emotional gut punches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The buzz around Millie and Brandon had long faded into yesterday&#39;s news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I nearly cried just from the trailer. When the show drops, I&#39;m definitely watching it first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is Vivian and Brandon&#39;s love story, right? It&#39;s heartbreaking-Vivian dying in his arms with their song playing...I can&#39;t handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hurry up and release it! I&#39;m ready to binge as soon as it&#39;s out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Millie scrolled through the comments, an amused smile tugged at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sooner Vivian&#39;s new show aired, the sooner Millie could push her lawsuit forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d also heard whispers that Vivian was determined to get the show approved for a theatrical run, but that review process would drag on. Millie doubted Vivian could actually pull it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was reading all this while seated in the Watson Group&#39;s conference room, her lawyer by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding the divorce agreement across the polished table to Eugene, she fixed him with a steady gaze and demanded that every asset be returned to her-including the old Bennett family business now under the Watson Group&#39;s control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eugene, please do a full inventory. I want the handover wrapped up within two days. This is my attorney, Darrion Clark. Any problem, you can reach out to him directly.&#34; She gestured to the man standing tall beside her, his presence quietly authoritative.</p>
