                <p>Millie stared at the ring, her expression vacant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t realized Myron had come up behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it to your liking?&#34; he asked from over her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie glanced up at him, catching her reflection in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for the ring, Myron held out his other hand, open and steady,waiting for her to place hers in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you allow me to be the one who stands by your side?&#34; he asked, his voice carried clearly by the nearby drone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he sank to one knee, gazing at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, let&#39;s get engaged,&#34; he said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron had thought about proposing outright, but he felt a real proposal should have a bigger, more special moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Traditionally,engagement followed a proposal. But this wasn&#39;t a traditional situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both knew this step didn&#39;t guarantee marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was something they had already discussed and accepted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless,it marked progress, an evolution beyond just calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MAyron noticed the slight redness around her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he wanted was to make life easier for her, to be the steady hand she could hold on to when things got hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t stand the thought of her hurting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie!&#34; Brandon&#39;s voice rang out from a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t flinch, didn&#39;t even glance toward the sound. Her eyes stayed on Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you certain?&#34; she asked softly, her chest tightening, warmth rising in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been certain for years,&#34; Myron answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes locked, and Millie was suddenly taken back to that moment in the hot air balloon-the quiet studio, his voice, his promises, the little things he&#39;d shown her that had stayed with her ever since.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, just before they left his place, he had watched her cradle the cat in her arms, gently stroking its fur,and said in a quiet voice, &#34;Millie, don&#39;t ever worry about being a burden or making things hard for me.You can be exactly who you are when you&#39;re with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked at Myron now. He had meant every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d once told her he could clearly tell the difference between love and gratitude. His feelings hadn&#39;t grown from obligation; they came later,when he matured and truly saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he never downplayed the help she&#39;d given him back then. He always acknowledged that he wouldn&#39;t be who he was without her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All his actions had been meant to reassure her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Brandon was still resisting, and the backup he&#39;d called had shown up, sparking a clash between the two sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Onlookers crowded around, phones raised, voices rising in excitement as they snapped photos and gossiped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sunlight beamed down, but Myron, still on one knee,saw only Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was all that mattered to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie.&#34; Noticing she&#39;d gone quiet, Myron spoke softly.&#34;Let me take care of you-please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie blinked, snapping back to reality. She smiled and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; she said, her eyes welling with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed her palm on his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drone continued broadcasting, and the crowd broke into cheers</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron held her hand firmly and slid the ring onto her finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a brilliant blue diamond that sparkled under the sun, matching the pendant resting at her collarbone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew her completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew there were many things that mattered to her-her father&#39;s death, Ari, and the Bennett family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew he wouldn&#39;t always come first in her life. But he didn&#39;t mind and still stood by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron rose to his feet, still gripping her left hand tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when Brandon finally got to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at their hands, locked tightly together, and at the ring resting on her finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun was warm, yet no warmth touched his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie,&#34; Brandon called,his eyes red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie didn&#39;t respond. Her only answer was the way she clutched Myron&#39;s hand even tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon opened his mouth to speak, but she didn&#39;t look at him. Her eyes remained on Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d already said everything that needed saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just go,&#34; Millie finally said. &#34;Brandon, we each have someone we care for now. Look ahead. Hold on to the people by your side. Stop hurting those who love you like you did to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the last thing she had to tell him. After that, there was nothing left for them to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon started to speak again, but the Elliott Group security guards stepped in and restrained him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie smiled, glancing up at Myron beside her, and together, hand in hand, they took another path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, Brandon stood frozen, watching them disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun caught the diamond on Miilie&#39;s finger, casting sharp reflections that made him flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in that moment, it hit him...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d never actually proposed to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No ring chosen with care. No flowers. No heartfelt ceremony. Not even a simple question on bended knee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never even asked whether she was willing to be his partner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he had done was walk into a jewelry store on their way to see his grandfather, pick out the first set of rings they saw, and slip one onto her finger casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie and Myron had vanished beyond the sunflower field. The security team no longer blocked Brandon&#39;s way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood alone, staring at the oversized photo frame nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his hand to touch Millie&#39;s smiling face on the photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked radiant and happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon couldn&#39;t remember the last time he&#39;d seen her smile like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his eyes dropped to another smaller photograph tucked in the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recognized it. That was years ago, in Eldoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So... you&#39;d already noticed her back then,&#34; Brandon thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hollow laugh slipped from his lips. &#34;Myron, you planned this from the start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon could still hear Millie&#39;s voice in his head. &#34;Look ahead. Hold on to the people by your side. Stop hurting those who love you like you did to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun was bright, yet Brandon felt like his heart was drenched in rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had only ever loved Millie.How was he supposed to just &#34;look ahead&#34; when she was walking away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon!&#34; Darden&#39;s voice came from beyond the sunflower field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got back-up!&#34; he called out. &#34;Do we go after them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon pulled his eyes away, walked straight to the vehicle, opened the door, and got in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drive,&#34; he said. &#34;Let&#39;s go after them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, on Elliott Group&#39;s end, the key players had already left, but the aftermath stirred nonstop chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myron pulled it off; he proposed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie and Myron are officially engaged!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news spread like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever talk there had been about Myron losing interest in Millie was silenced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He loved her fiercely and had proven it openly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the experience hall was set up like an interactive showcase, it drew a lot of attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Visitors who came were deeply moved and ended up making purchases, not just because the new designs were outstanding and Elliott Group&#39;s quality was reliable, but also because the venue and storytelling created a powerful emotional pull that sparked a surge in sales.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For those arriving later, a particular highlight drew attention: the pair of prop documents Millie had once placed inside the exhibit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But they had been replaced. In their place now stood a gemstone sculpture, crystal-clear and flawless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sculpture featured a dragon, carved in striking detail, shielding something beneath its massive wings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Visitors leaned in, trying to see what the dragon was protecting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a single teardrop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the meaning was left open to interpretation, rumors continued swirling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard Brandon&#39;s assistant, Eugene, stormed into Serenity Villa and cut Vivian&#39;s livestream.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bunch of people saw it; there was a full crowd at the gate!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Vivian went in to livestream without Brandon&#39;s permission?&#34;</p>
