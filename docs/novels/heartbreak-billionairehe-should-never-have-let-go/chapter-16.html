                <p>Inside Crobert Hospital, Alexia moved restlessly,pacing the floor with worry etched across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had Rh-negative blood, and back when she spoke about ending the pregnancy, Alexia had started to arrange for blood supply for the procedure in advance, just to be safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hadn&#39;t been long since that moment, and the blood reserves still hadn&#39;t been restocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if something went wrong and Millie needed a transfusion right away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia and Millie&#39;s friendship began before either of them could walk. Side by side, they were rarely seen apart, even as children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A legacy of medicine surrounded Alexia from birth,her home brimming with tales of healing and textbooks that lined every shelf. Yet, much of her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>knowledge was secondhand-gleaned from stories,not true emergencies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything changed the day she and Millie slipped away for a secret adventure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An itch for excitement led Alexia to swipe her brother&#39;s motorcycle and convince Millie to join her for a wild ride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wind whipped past as the two raced down back roads, Millie&#39;s striking looks only adding to Alexia&#39;s feeling of reckless freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speed kept building, until a sudden swerve sent them crashing to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia counted herself lucky, escaping with just a few scrapes. Millie, however, was hurled across the gravel, her leg slamming into a rock and splitting open in a deep, ugly wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood spilled faster than Alexia had ever seen, and panic seized her as she fumbled to dial for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every minute felt endless; the remote location meantthe ambulance took far too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time paramedics finally arrived, Millie was already ghostly pale from blood loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That terrifying experience was the first time Alexia realized just how serious Millie&#39;s rare Rh-negative blood type truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reserves existed at the small clinic, not even a single matching bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her friend slip into shock, Alexia sobbed desperately, calling her father for help as the doctors scrambled to save Millie&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A miracle pulled Millie back from the brink that day,and Alexia knew she would never forget it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time passed, but the faded scar on Millie&#39;s leg never disappeared-no matter how many doctors tried, the mark refused to heal completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to transform guilt into something meaningful, Millie invited Alexia to a tattoo studio,where they both chose matching designs tocelebrate the survival etched into their skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories like that lingered as Alexia grabbed her phone and began reaching out to every contact she could think of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexia speaking,&#34; she said to the first responder, her voice steady. &#34;There&#39;s an accident-my friend is pregnant, and she could need Rh-negative blood at any moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her next call connected to the Blood Donor Network.&#34;Yes, this is Alexia. I need support for a potential urgent case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Send as many donors as possible-even if we don&#39;t need them right away, I&#39;d rather be prepared,&#34; she insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft thank-you escaped her as she realized help was lining up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief crept in only after she confirmed everyone was on alert and ready to act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, uncertainty gnawed at her-no one could tell herfor sure how Millie was holding up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In hopes of steadying her nerves, she turned back to the policewoman to get the full story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she learned left her rattled. &#34;You mean someone actually tried to kill Millie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thoughts tumbled through Alexia&#39;s head, each scenario darker than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps some old rival of the Bennett family finally decided to settle a score.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trouble often found Millie by association, especially now that she was tied to Brandon and the powerful Watson Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Public outrage had reached a fever pitch since Vivian&#39;s cancer began trending; Alexia knew how quickly online anger could turn into real-world danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Professional jealousies, everyday arguments, and unseen grudges only widened the pool of suspects.Anyone could have held a motive; the possibilities stretched endlessly in every direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the hospital doors,Millie drifted through a haze, her senses dulled and scattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faint impressions of gloved hands and watchful eyes drifted in as unfamiliar doctors checked her condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room pulsed with the sharp ring of metal and the steady hum of machines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Voices floated through the haze, their words jumbled and distant, just out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she managed to catch were bits and pieces-words like &#34;pregnant&#34; and &#34;bleeding&#34; floated past her in scattered whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her baby-she remembered now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With effort that seemed to drain her last reserves,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she managed to whisper, &#34;Please... save... my baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret twisted in her chest, sharp and sudden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the police station, just before she lost consciousness, fear had nearly swallowed her whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For so long, Millie had imagined a child would keep her tied to Brandon, something real to bind their unraveling love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, both hopes had slipped away-she&#39;d given up on Brandon, and with him, the idea of motherhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As days passed after finding out about her pregnancy and life quietly grew inside her, that certainty began to crumble, replaced by doubt and longing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, as danger pressed closer, the thought of losing the child filled her with a sorrow she could hardly name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was her child, the extension of her own life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That child had nothing to do with Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hers and hers alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping the baby was all she wanted now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon pressed hard on the accelerator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension radiated from the passenger seat, where Vivian gripped her seatbelt so tightly her knuck&lt;les turned pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a word escaped her lips; silence was her safest choice after the show she&#39;d put on earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Brandon&#39;s mood hovered over the car like a storm cloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She risked a sidelong glance at his profile, searching for any sign of weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression was cold as ever, but the rigid jaw and clenched hands betrayed a swirling storm inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie still held a piece of his heart-that much was obvious, and Vivian seethed at the realization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping her gaze, Vivian slumped back, masking her calculations with a display of fragile exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crobert Hospital loomed into view much faster than she expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they stopped, Brandon threw his door open, barely pausing as he strode into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian scrambled out behind him, but halfway onto the pavement, she doubled over and spat a splash of &#34;blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about me,&#34; she remnarked, dabbing at her lips and painting her words with practiced weakness. &#34;I&#39;m not long for this world anyway. Go on,Millie needs you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry flickered across Brandon&#39;s face, his gaze torn between duty and compassion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, Vivian gently nudged him forward, playing up her own supposed sacrifice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t argue, only nodded, the lines of his mouth drawn tight. &#34;I&#39;ll see how she&#39;s doing. You look after yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Vivian answered softly, eyes tracking him as he disappeared inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner was he out of sight than her mask dropped-she whipped out her phone, scrolling for updates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s steps echoed through the hospital lobby picking up speed with every stride until he was nearly running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on him just how much fear still gripped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nurse pointed him down the hall, and he rushed toward Millie&#39;s room, only to find his path blocked by Alexia&#39;s determined stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension spiked in his brow, eyes narrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is she? Tell me the truth,&#34; he asked, voice low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia took her time answering, sizing him up with caution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on here?&#34; Brandon snapped, trying and failing to keep his temper in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Details from the policewoman&#39;s story replayed in Alexia&#39;s mind-doubts swirling, suspicions growing.Maybe Brandon had orchestrated everything just to get rid of Millie so he could finally be with Vivian?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would likely explained his failure to answer any of the frantic calls from Millie&#39;s phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words caught in Alexia&#39;s throat, unsure where to begin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Brandon grow more restless by the second, Alexia hesitated before speaking. &#34;Brandon,is marrying Vivian so urgent that even waiting a single day feels like too much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon turned to face her, a hint of confusion in his eyes. &#34;What are you trying to say?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia hesitated, caught between distrust and worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she stood there wavering, Brandon&#39;s impatience finally boiled over. &#34;Get out of the way!&#34;</p>
