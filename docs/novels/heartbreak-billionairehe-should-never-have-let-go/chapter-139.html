                <p>Brandon understood exactly what Vivian meant. But right now, he simply wasn&#39;t in the mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had just gone through a divorce. Romance,let alone sex, was the last thing on his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the moment, all he wanted was some peace and quiet. He didn&#39;t want to think about anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As that thought settled, he found himself relieved that he had agreed to meet Darden at the Blue Lounge, which now gave him the perfect excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promised Darden I&#39;d stop by,&#34; he said finally.&#34;You&#39;re not feeling well anyway. You should head up and rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian looked at him, lips pressed into a thin line.&#34;Brandon, are you really not just making excuses? Or is it that... you still have feelings for Millie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice wavered as her eyes began to well with tears. &#34;If you don&#39;t want me, just say so. Go back to her, then. I think she&#39;d still take you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon exhaled slowly, running a hand gently through her hair. &#34;Vivian, I&#39;m already divorced. That was my decision. I didn&#39;t hesitate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked away, her expression wounded. Brandon reached for his phone and showed her the earlier message from Darden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See? I&#39;m not making excuses. Just give me some time, alright?&#34; he said quietly. &#34;I need space to clear my head.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian glanced at the message and then down at her hands, visibly guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; she murmured. &#34;I thought...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay. Just go get some rest.&#34; Brandon gave her hand a reassuring squeeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian hesitated, but then gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the door and stepped out of the car.Turning back, she looked at him, her eyes red. &#34;P&#39;ll wait for you,&#34; she said sincerely. &#34;Until I can&#39;t anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t reply right away. He just nodded and said, &#34;Good night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian turned and walked into the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon waited until she disappeared inside, and then shifted the car into reverse and pulled away from the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two seconds later, the entrance door swung open again.Vivian reappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gone was the fragile, teary-eyed expression from before. She stared after Brandon&#39;s taillights, her gaze sharp with resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen the hesitation in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still wasn&#39;t over Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her lip, seething. She had to find a way to truly become Brandon&#39;s woman and bear his child.Otherwise, everything would start to unravel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the Blue Lounge, Millie and Charles were still on the dance floor while Darden waited upstairs in a private room, bored out of his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out his phone and opened Alyssa&#39;s chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since she called himn a &#34;useless bastard who only knew how to sleep around&#34; and broke up with him, she&#39;d thrown herself into her new career-appraising secondhand luxury goods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden had stopped by her shop a few times, only to learn she&#39;d already quit. Now she was working sales in a different boutique.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found the change strange. Had she failed to meet her quotas? WVas that why she quit?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had once bankrolled her entire lifestyle,convinced she&#39;d come crawling back once reality hit.But she hadn&#39;t. Surprisingly, she was still holding out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, he had to admit-he missed her a bit. That fiery temper of hers was oddly endearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of her, he sent a message. &#34;What have you been up to lately? Need any help with business?Want me to throw some clients your way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long for her to reply. &#34;Fuck off,you jerk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also sent a fierce emoji.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden snorted, amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still got that bite,&#34; he muttered to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he loved it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to make time to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tucked the phone away, leaned on the armrest,and took another sip of his drink while watching the dance floor below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was sipping his drink, his eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked, and then squinted to confirm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that...Millie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression darkened. If Brandon saw this...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly put down his glass and rushed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as he stepped into the hallway, the door to the neighboring private room opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia stepped out, smiling. &#34;Seville, while Giffard&#39;s in the bathroom, I&#39;m heading downstairs to join Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Want to come-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped mid-sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You?&#34; she and Darden said in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Darden strode past her and peeked into the room she just came out from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the male escorts were dancing awkwardly alongside a rotund man in flashy clothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden&#39;s expression turned stormy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was what Millie and Alexia were up to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drinking,partying, and surrounding themselves with escorts?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Brandon found out...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34; Alexia snapped,trying to shut the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden blocked it. &#34;Did you bring Millie here? You&#39;re having too much fun,missy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia shot back, &#34;What&#39;s wrong with it? If you&#39;re allowed to be here, why can&#39;t we be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Darden had known each other since childhood. They weren&#39;t close, but they&#39;d crossed paths enough over the years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia had heard enough about Brandon and Darden&#39;s regular nights out to resent them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Brandon often mentioned how Alexia and Millie were always scheming together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this meeting was like a spark to dry tinder. It was like enemies reuniting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We come here to drink and blow off steam. You think this is the same?&#34; Darden growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s exactly the same!&#34; Alexia fired back. &#34;We&#39;re free women. What&#39;s wrong with dancing and a little eye candy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want to come, fine. But don&#39;t drag Mille into it,&#34;he snapped, trying to push past her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare!&#34; she said, grabbing his arm. &#34;Leave Millie alone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexia!&#34; Darden barked. The two of them were now fully arguing in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Brandon had parked in the lounge&#39;s underground garage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat for a moment, staring at the street through the windshield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day had drained him more than he expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he checked his phone, it was already past Just three more hours, and the day would finally be over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got out of the car and made his way inside the club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heavy music hit him instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd danced without inhibition as lights flashed rhythmically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved past the dance floor toward the stairs. But just as his eyes swept over the crowd, something stopped him cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman in the middle of the dance floor. She was laughing,her hair bouncing as she danced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon froze.Millie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was she doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And on the dance floor...smiling like that?</p>
