                <p>Millie landed hard, her back hitting the ground first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameras flashed wildly, capturing the fall from every angle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked toward Brandon by instinct. But his face.gave nothing-just a cold, still stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in that moment, she understood what he wanted her to do, and it stung her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted her to speak for him. To tell the press it was all a misunderstanding. That Vivian was ill,and he had only come out of concern. That it was kindness, no betrayal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching her belly, Millie lowered her head and let a faint smile slip across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky above was clear, and sunlight streamed through gaps in the crowd. But none of it touchedher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She steadied herself and rose slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without looking back, she said calmly, &#34;I feel sorry for Miss Simpson. But that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone nearby, unaware, asked, &#34;So, are you friends with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave a short laugh. &#34;Friends? No. I wouldn&#39;t call someone clinging to mny husband a friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and waved to Alexia, who had just pulled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie!&#34; Brandon called after her, his face red with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t turn around. She stood tall and kept walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia got out and moved quickly toward her friend,scoffing as they left, &#34;You&#39;d think they were the married couple confronting the home-wrecker.Absolutely ridiculous.&#34;Vivian&#39;s lips parted to respond. &#34;You...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexia cut in before she could say a word.&#34;What?Tell me I&#39;m wrong. If you&#39;re planning to use the press to scare me, go ahead. I&#39;ve ggot nothing to hide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s face turned even paler, looking as if she might faint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reporters scrambled, voices rising all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia ushered Millie into the car, not sparing another glance behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry,&#34; she said. &#34;She&#39;s definitely faking it.I&#39;ve seen enough of these cases to tell in a second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave her a small smile. &#34;I&#39;m not worried about her. I&#39;m worried about you. What if this mess affects your job?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At a red light, Alexia grinned and nudged her. &#34;Don&#39;t forget my dad&#39;s the hospital director.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie raised an eyebrow. &#34;The same dad you swore you&#39;d never speak to again?&#34;Alexia shrugged. &#34;You never know when a connection comes in handy. Honestly, sometimes I wish all the powerful people out there were my dads.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both laughed, the tension slowly easing from Millie&#39;s face. As the light turned green, the car moved forward again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got the afternoon free,&#34; Alexia said, stretching.&#34;Whatever you need, I&#39;m ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Playing along, Millie turned to her with a sly grin.&#34;Great. I need help with something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Alexia asked curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help me move.&#34; She grabbed Alexia&#39;s wrist. &#34;You can&#39;t back out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia groaned but gave in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the two of them arrived at the house Millie had shared with Brandon, along with a team of movers and organizers.The house had come together quickly after their rushed wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything-furniture and layout-had felt temporary at first. But over the year, Millie had made a home out of it, filling it with warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least, she tried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia directed the workers while Millie moved quietly around the room, her hands light on every object. On a shelf, she spotted a bottle of Chanel No.5.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first gift Brandon ever gave her. He&#39;d brought it back from a business trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came straight to her from the airport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had pulled her into his arms. His kisses were quick, urgent. They had been just like any young couple in love back then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the bottle and sprayed it once. The scent filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered how he had kissed her lightly afterspraying it on her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I pack this too?&#34; Alexia asked, seeing the perfume.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie glanced over and shook her head. &#34;Leave it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped off the wedding ring Brandon had picked without thought, placing it gently on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as the movers shuffled back and forth through.the space, she paused. Then, quietly, she opened a drawer and put both the perfume and the ring inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the house had been cleared of every trace of her. Only that bottle andd that ring remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Packing up had been tiring, but once the decision was made, it moved quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the same with her feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind moved softly through her hair as the car headed toward her new place. Behind her, the mansion faded in the rearview mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes, to move forward, one had to leave partsof oneself behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had things to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fall of the Bennett family, the unanswered questions around her father&#39;s sudden death-she was going to find the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her life had always been shaped by what others needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now it was time to live for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided to begin with the music show. It would bring in money, and more importantly, might reconnect her with people linked to her father&#39;s past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled out her phone, found the right contact,and typed her message. &#34;I&#39;m joining the music program.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was still crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon sat beside her, muttering words of comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his thoughts were filled with the image of Milliestanding with her back to him, saying those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had known exactly what he wanted her to say.And she had chosen not to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had sent her message after message. She hadn&#39;t replied any of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been acting strangely lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The change in her was too sharp, too sudden. She was provoking him on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had done it when they filed for divorce. And again at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon remembered the look in her eyes the night before, when she asked if he truly made up his mind about the divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been sad but also calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unexpected fear filled his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, don&#39;t be angry at Millie,&#34; Vivian said through tears. &#34;I know she&#39;s upset. After seeing the videos online, she must&#39;ve come to confront us. AndI understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She burst into tears. &#34;After all... I&#39;m the one who took something from her. I&#39;m taking six months from your marriage-what&#39;s left of it. If she lashes out at mne,I deserve it...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, she started coughing-hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second later, she spat blood into her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian!&#34; Brandon jumped up, reaching for his phone to call for an ambulance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Millie&#39;s sudden change, he brushed it off as moodiness. In his mind, she wouldn&#39;t dare walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian reached out and stopped him, still smiling faintly. &#34;It&#39;s the cancer. It&#39;s late-stage. This happens.Don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her caregiver helped her lie back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon turned away, already thinking of confronting Millie. As soon as he left the room, Vivian calmly wiped her mouth and pulled out a small blood baghidden in her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laughed. &#34;What do you think he&#39;ll say to Millie now?&#34; she asked the caregiver. &#34;I&#39;m honestly looking forward to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she began to go through the news reports excitedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire online community seemed against Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian didn&#39;t even go for life-saving treatment-she just wanted pain meds. Millie really made a scene for no reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian&#39;s dying, and Millie still wants to pick fights?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson and Vivian look perfect together. Like a real power couple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie&#39;s fall was so embarrassing. I cringed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, just step aside already!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, divorce Brandon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,divorce Brandon!&#34;&#34;Divorce!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian chuckled as she read the comments. Then she sent a message to a contact and gave a few instructions. &#34;Today&#39;s move was perfect. Keep the pressure up. Make sure Millie stays where she is-down. Oh, and find out why she went to the hospital today.&#34;</p>
