                <p>Brandon instantly recognized the backdrop of Vivian&#39;s live stream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another moment wasted, he stopped watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of lingering, he immediately turned to the person-next to him and gave off instructions while dialing Eugene&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Eugene picked up right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By that point, Brandon was already sliding into his car, arranging for the quickest helicopter route back to Crobert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eugene, are you there?&#34; Brandon&#39;s tone was sharp and urgent. &#34;What&#39;s happening with Vivian?&#34; asked Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been rushing through Proidan all morning, barely wrapping up his tasks, and was completely exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to ease the pounding in his head, Brandon pressed his fingers to his temples. &#34;I thought her first livestream was supposed to happen at Darden&#39;s place? So why is she at Serenity Villa now? Who gave her the door code·to get in?&#34; His eyes flashed with icy suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, what?&#34; Eugene sounded genuinely lost.&#34;Mr. Watson, weren&#39;t you the one who gave her the code and let her in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reality was, nobody else had that information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Access for the cleaning staff was granted only with temporary codes that would time out after twenty minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone needing access to the villa had to request approval first, with the butler double-checking their plans before sharing a temporary entry code.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Brandon&#39;s recovery, he chose to move into an apartment across from the place Millie had currently lived,leaving the villa mostly unattended except for occasional maintenance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no hesitation, Brandon&#39;s voice was ice-cold as he snapped, &#34;Find out who&#39;s behind this. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Brandon ended the call, he dialed Vivian&#39;s number immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried reaching Vivian&#39;s assistant next, only to be met with silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn,&#34; he muttered, annoyance briefly crossing his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s right hand balled into a fist, slamming against the inside of the car with a solid, echoing thump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his knuckles stung, Brandon barely flinched, forcing his eyes closed as he tried to steady his nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second later, something clicked in his mind, and he quickly called Darden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden,meanwhile, was already fighting his way through heavy traffic en route to Serenity Villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Vivian&#39;s live broadcast started and some people recognized the background as Millie and Brandon&#39;s old place, soon crowds flocked to the address for the latest scoop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden, sounding frazzled, updated Brandon about a broken water pipe and added, &#34;I have no clue what she&#39;s up to. She hasn&#39;t checked in with me at all and just went straight there to your place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m heading over now,&#34; Brandon said, determination hardening his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have my word, Brandon. I&#39;ll make sure she leaves,&#34; Darden assured him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that settled, Brandon wasted no time as he changed the villa&#39;s password right then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning his attention to the live stream, he watched closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie was front and center on the screen, giving viewers a tour of the gemstone flower arrangements inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new line of products had been unveiled in the middle of that sparkling display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were branded as the Golden collection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gleaming gold mist intertwined with the base of the gemstone flowers, creating the illusion of golden waves washing through a radiant river.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glow from the overhead lights only emphasized its shimmering beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right there, customers could purchase items from the Golden collection, nestled among the dazzling flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire setup looked less like a store and more like a luxurious mini gallery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything sparkled, as if encased in a world of golden glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dreamy atmosphere filled the air, thanks to Eva&#39;s enchanted song playing throughout the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every new piece, there was a delicate golden card, each one inscribed with its own message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie exchanged a glance and nodded at someone off-camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right away, a staff member stepped forward and began the story. &#34;Once upon a time, a brave knight set out for a distant castle, determined to slay a dragon and save a princess. His bravery, gentle spirit, and sharp mind won her heart. Together, they stood before the king and pledged their love, living out their own happy ending...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This felt straight out of a storybook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Between the staff member&#39;s captivating narration, the golden glow, and Eva&#39;s enchanting melody, the entire space felt magical, like stepping into a real-life fairy tale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stood quietly, taking it all in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Countless variations of this tale were told.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when she shared it with Brandon, she&#39;d mentioned another twist, a tale where the brave knight vanquished the dragon to rescue a maiden, just to become a dragon himself among the rewards of triumph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Timeless, yet always open to interpretation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the story wrapped up, the staff member added, &#34;For the Golden collection, Elliott Group collaborated with acclaimed writers to craft short stories that celebrate friendship, family, romance, and all things bright.Many of these products come with their own tales, but for others, you&#39;re invited to create your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments after the announcement, several famous authors stepped forward and greeted the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small, satisfied smile, Millie watched visitors gather to read these tales, nodding her approval to the team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff member soon returned, reminding everyone that only a handful of products came prepackaged with stories. Most awaited new narratives, written either by buyers or the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The online audience was already buzzing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People wasted no time sharing their own stories, eager to see if anyone would be interested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the Internet was buzzing with a brand-new trend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A challenge named &#34;Create Stories for the Latest Golden Collection&#34; began spreading across the Internet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One post sparked another, encouraging many to showcase their writing talents, and before long, Elliott Group&#39;s newest collection was the center of attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the excitement kept building, Elliott Group jumped in, announcing plans to reach out to standout storytellers, offering contracts and payment for the best submissions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, everyone wanted to write the next great story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cheers in her earpiece signaled to Millie that everything backstage was running smoothly. She shifted her attention to the live stream, satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Vivian spotted the growing excitement, but she played it cool and led her viewers toward the bathroom instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her audience urged her to keep things interesting. The top comment flashed on screen read,&#34;Millie&#39;s already made a move, Vivian! Your turn, do something exciting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that exact moment, Brandon arrived at the helipad and climbed aboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to send a comment through Vivian&#39;s stream since she wouldn&#39;t pick up his calls, hoping she&#39;d see his warning, but his words got lost among thousands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoosh...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the engine roaring, the helicopter blades whipped through the air as Brandon took flight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the signal dropping, he could no longer followthe broadcast, so he fired off a message to Eugene as a backup plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Reach out to the platform and pull the plug on Vivian&#39;s live stream.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s live stream continued as she strolled intothe bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm, where should I put this?&#34; Vivian mused aloud, pacing around for her viewers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted everyone watching to get a full look at the batroom&#39;s layout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a spacious bathroom, and Vivian wandered back and forth, narrating her thoughts as she explored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything appeared ordinary until her gaze landed on a small door tucked off to one side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, what&#39;s this?&#34; she asked, curiosity sparked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chat exploded with guesses as she reached for the handle. Though she&#39;d been given a password, it turned out the door was already unlocked. Someone must have opened it before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping through, Vivian revealed a second, smaller bathroom that was nothing like the first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A large floor mirror caught her eye, along with a sturdy metal handle installed nearby.</p>
