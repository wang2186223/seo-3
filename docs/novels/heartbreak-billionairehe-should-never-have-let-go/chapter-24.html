                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m with her now. I&#39;ll take her over myself.&#34;Charles&#39; voice came just before his footsteps reached the door. He gave a quick knock and stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he caught sight of Millie, he stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait... are you-Millie?&#34; His voice held hesitation,like he wasn&#39;t sure if he was seeing correctly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t his fault. Millie had changed. She was thinner now, wore a mask, and had dressed with such quiet intensity that her beauty looked almost unreal-so striking that even Alexia might not recognize her at a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie caught the look on his face and gave a small.nod,almost apologetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s me,&#34; she said simply. &#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles nodded slowly, like his brain hadn&#39;t caught up with his heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had always been beautiful. But this was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before, her beauty was soft, something that blended gently into the room. Now, it was sharp and bold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying anything, Charles picked up along coat and carefully draped it over her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he helped her outside, guiding her toward a sleek SUV waiting by the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, a stylist was already set up, ready with tools,nail polish, and heels lined up in a row. They began the finishing touches while the driver pulled onto the road, heading straight for the live broadcast of Heavenly Melody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, another car was making its way there. And this one carrying Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the backseat, Vivian sat as the makeup artist worked carefully around her eyes, building the image</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she wanted-soft, delicate, almost fragile-while she called Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, it&#39;s me-Vivian,&#34; she said sweetly. &#34;Yes,today&#39;s the first live taping. You have to come.I saved a seat just for you. They&#39;re only letting me in because of you, Brandon. I&#39;m really grateful for everything. I&#39;ll give it my best, I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After she hung up, she sent a quick text. &#34;Brandon.will be attending today. Make sure the follow-up steps are ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When a simple &#34;OK&#34; came back, Vivian leaned back and smiled, satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Backstage at Heavenly Melody, Millie stood among the other contestants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stir moved through the room. Millie looked up to see Vivian walking in, her assistant following behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the contestants were from smaller labels or were fresh faces just getting their start. They had already been told-&#34;Don&#39;t cross Vivian Simpson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So as soon as she entered, one by one, they stood to greet her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Simpson!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pleasure to meet you, Miss Simpson!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Miss Simpson!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stayed where she was, silent in the background, her eyes steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had learned the rules of the industry long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had Brandon&#39;s support now-the entire Watson Group was behind her. That alone was enough to make people treat her like royalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie had no interest in playing along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned quietly and walked away, without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian, warm and friendly with the others, took note of the silent figure slipping out. Her eyes paused for a moment. She had read up on all twelve contestants.She knew eleven well. Only one name, Serena Ellsworth, had no clear profile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others had background info, pictures, past work.But Serena&#39;s details were sealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with the Watson Group&#39;s name behind her,Vivian couldn&#39;t get past the block.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff only told her Serena was under Charles&#39;personal management, and that all records were kept within Evans Entertainment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian just met Serena backstage, but nothing about her sparked no memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confident, cool, slightly distant-maybe she was Charles&#39; girlfriend?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t matter. Vivian had already dealt with Brandon&#39;s wife. Charles&#39; mystery lover wouldn&#39;t be harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she put the thought aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Millie stood beside the stage, quietly reviewing the setup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The show had twelve contestants, three judges, and a five-round competition format, each round spaced a week apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The show aired live first, with a shorter, polished version uploaded later for viewers who preferred quick highlights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today&#39;s live broadcast was the first of the season-a soft opening, mainly to introduce the performers,meet the judges, and split everyone into teams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twelve contestants, three teams-each led by a judge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was one of the judges. The other two were well-known singers with solid reputations in the industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stepped onto the stage, choosing her spot with care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t joined the earlier rehearsals in person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, she was still recovering and had only watched and helped coordinate remotely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That absence had stirred whispers. Some said she was difficult. Said she thought too highly of herself.Charles had handled it behind the scenes. He sent out a medical report-her name carefully removed-confirming that Serena had been through a serious accident just ten days before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with her standing here under the stage lights,people could see the faint bruises along her arms,even with makeup doing its best to hide them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rumors died quickly. The truth was visible enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie noticed some of, the staff watching her curiously. She didn&#39;t know why and didn&#39;t care to guess.She kept her attention on the setup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stir rippled through the venue. She looked up instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon had arrived. She heard the whispers behind</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait... that&#39;s Mr. Watson, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s he doing here? Didn&#39;t he usually avoid public events like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know who&#39;s on the guest list.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, right. He&#39;s here for Vivian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. The Watson Group has some investments in entertainment, but it&#39;s mostly tech.The only person here who could bring Brandon to a set like this is Vivian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So those rumors are true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t he have a wife though?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is common among the rich. And Vivian&#39;s sick.His wife probably lets it go. I think Vivian&#39;s a better match. At least she&#39;s strong enough to deal with it.The wife probably clings to the Watson name and looks the other way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If my boyfriend ever pulled something like that, I&#39;d walk out. No hesitation. A woman who tolerates that kind of thing deserves what she gets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39; voice came in, cold and sharp. &#34;That&#39;s enough.You know better than to gossip here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked up to Millie, his eyes scanning her face for、any reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t say much with people around, but his concern was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie caught his look and gave him a small smnile,followed by a slight shake of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t bothered. She had already made her peace with letting Brandon go. So what if people talked?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve arranged for someone to go through the program with you backstage,&#34; Charles said. &#34;Let&#39;s head there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded and walked with him toward the side of the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Vivian had reached Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon,&#34; she greeted warmly with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm.&#34; He gave her a nod, his eyes already drifting past her. He caught a glimpse of a woman in a long coat walking beside Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian noticed. &#34;That&#39;s Serena Ellsworth,&#34; she said casually. &#34;The one I told you about. She&#39;s probably Charles&#39; secret girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She missed rehearsals,&#34; Vivian went on. &#34;People said she was acting like a diva. But then Charles submitted a medical report-said she&#39;d been in an accident ten days ago, so she couldn&#39;t make it.&#34;Vivian leaned in slightly, voice lowered, but her smile wide. &#34;I didn&#39;t think much of it-until I heard something more private.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused. &#34;The accident involved a miscarriage.&#34;</p>
