                <p>The whole room pulsed with restless anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had already pushed the price higher three separate times,each increase landing with a sense of urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s latest offer shot up from a modest hundred thousand to three hundred thousand, making it painfully clear how badly she wanted to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is something happening here? Hasn&#39;t bidder number 823 realized who she&#39;s up against? She&#39;s really holding her ground.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no way she&#39;s in the dark. Serena arrived tonight with Charles, and the Evans Group is the one running the show. Charles has to be aware of everything that&#39;s happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right, so what are they trying to pull?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, it&#39;s anybody&#39;s guess. Brandon might not be bidding himself, but his date is the one raising the paddle. It&#39;s almost like number 823 is challenging Brandon head-on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The tanzanite itself is only valued at a million. If you ask me, spending anything above 1.2 million just isn&#39;t smart. To shoot up to one and a half million, there&#39;s got to be a story behind it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t tell you. Are you thinking Brandon will push the price even higher?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Brandon was placing the bids himself, I&#39;d expect him to do it for the sake of his pride. But this time, it&#39;s Vivian stepping in, so there&#39;s no telling what she&#39;ll decide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t Brandon worry about getting embarrassed in front of everyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You might not realize it, but he wins either way. If he keeps fighting for it, it proves he&#39;s determined. If he lets the other bidder take it, he can always say she needed it more, and it makes him look generous in front of everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,is that really how it works?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not? Everyone in this room already knows Brandon&#39;s wealthy enough to go the distance. If he backs off, nobody&#39;s going to doubt that he lacks the money. They&#39;ll just figure he&#39;s showing some class.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still, it feels a little awkward. He can&#39;t even manage to win a tanzanite worth a million?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but if he really wants to, he could always just buy it later and hand it over as a gift. That takes care of everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that&#39;s clever. I have to say, I&#39;m impressed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People kept whispering and guessing, their attention fixed on the second floor above them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, every guest sat in their seat without so much as a fidget. Outwardly, everything seemed composed,but underneath it all, the tension was sharp enough to cut the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie sent Charles a worried look. &#34;Is this going to cause problems for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles answered with a smile, &#34;You&#39;re the one bidding,using your own paddle. That has nothing to do with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile returned to Millie&#39;s face as she glanced at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the tabletop sat two paddles, one meant for Serena and the other for Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each of them had received an invitation, so both had their own bidding number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, going up against Brandon so openly would likely have some consequences. Charles noticed how uneasy she was. &#34;There&#39;s nothing to be afraid of,&#34; he said as he tried to reassure her.&#34;I can handle whatever comes out of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her another nudge. &#34;Bid however you feel like bidding. I&#39;ll cover anything you need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MMillie turned to Charles with a quiet gaze and remarked gently, &#34;I appreciate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The money didn&#39;t worry her at all. What she really wanted to know was if Brandon would get dragged into trouble because of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the moment, Brandon made no move. But would he later? No one knew for sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian, on her part, felt trapped by the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to raise the bid higher would be painful, and she couldn&#39;t guess whether her rival would push the price up even further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to raise the bid might make both her and Brandon look bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wavered for a moment, and Brandon tapped his finger on the table in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep going,&#34; said Brandon, his tone firm and direct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian didn&#39;t move right away. Instead, she turned toward him with anxious eyes. &#34;Brandon, we don&#39;t need to keep going. The bid is already past the real value.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was another pause as she looked embarrassed.&#34;And honestly, I don&#39;t even have enough left to cover it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s eyes went straight to the tanzanite, his expression calm and collected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, he felt like the tanzanite belonged to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you worry about the money,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message was simple. He intended to pay for everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian gave a relieved sigh, though she still insisted,&#34;No, Brandon. We promised I would cover it on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the while, a few guests kept to the shadows,quietly observing as they waited for the outcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that very moment, the villa&#39;s front doors flung wide open, grabbing everyone&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wheelchair made its way inside, carrying an elderly man who managed to look dignified and strong,even while seated. A warm smile lit up the man&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apologies for arriving late,&#34; he said, smiling. &#34;The energy in here is incredible tonight. I could hear all the excitement before I even came in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Charles caught sight of the old man, he quickly got up and hurried down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved in to help him. &#34;Grandpa, what brought you here yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles had assumed Napier would remain tucked away in a private seat and send for Millie later. Seeing Napier come through the main entrance in his wheelchair had caught him by surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Napier leaned on his cane as he answered, &#34;I simply wanted to see things for myself.&#34; At the same moment, two other members of the Evans family arrived and stepped forward to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek motioned for them to hold back, still smiling as he glanced around at the crowd, pausing when his eyes landed on Brandon, Vivian, and Millie; then he turned his gaze to the item up for auction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, he said something that tended to go over people&#39;s heads. &#34;There&#39;s something truly special about being young.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Napier&#39;s unexpected appearance caused everything in the room to come to a standstill. The auctioneer prepared to continue, but Napier tapped lightly on a plate beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s time for a short break now. We&#39;ll pick up with the next round in a little while,&#34; he announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, the auction came to a pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People throughout the room grew more and more restless, eager for what would happen next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of seeing the final moments of the bidding,everyone was asked to wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Napier could feel that the crowd was growing impatient, but he stayed silent as his grandsons helped him toward the elevator leading up to the third floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right before the elevator doors slid shut, he spoke to Charles. &#34;Go get her for me. I want to see her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no confusion about whom he meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of panic hit Charles. This was definitely the worst time for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone present had just witnessed the tense bidding match between bidder 823 and bidder 888. Taking Millie to see his grandfather now would only make things worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had things gone smoothly before, there might have been a chance. Unfortunately, that window had closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39; oldest brother kept quiet, while his second gave a sly grin. &#34;Go ahead, Charles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing Charles could do but obey. He shot Oakley a frustrated look before heading off to find Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie already sensed what was about to happen.Before Charles even spoke, she nodded to show she understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy sigh escaped Charles. He knew she would have to face this on her own. He helped her to her feet and walked with her toward a private room on the third floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My grandfather is waiting inside,&#34; he said quietly.&#34;Be on your guard. If you need anything, just call out and I&#39;ll be right there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile crossed Millie&#39;s lips. &#34;I&#39;m sure it isn&#39;t as frightening as you&#39;re making it seem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles insisted, his nervousness written all over his face. &#34;But it is! You have no idea how serious this is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie did not push the matter any further. She nodded and said, &#34;Okay, I&#39;m going in now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of Charles&#39; brothers remained close by, keeping an eye on Charles as he paced nervously in front of the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Millie stepped into the room, calmly closing the door behind her before walking toward Napier with measured steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She came to a stop and, using her right hand, took off the custom half-mask she had been wearing. She did it with confidence, showing her whole face to Napier without any hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It became clear in that moment that it wasn&#39;t Serena standing before him. It was Millie.</p>
