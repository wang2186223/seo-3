                <p>Through</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Elliott Group came on board as a sponsor before the fourth live show, and Millie remembered Charles mentioning their plans to get involved with the champion&#39;s future development as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For that reason, it made perfect sense for them to be present, checking on advertisements and other business matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Millie&#39;s thoughts kept drifting back to her conversation with Myron earlier that mnorning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced over her shoulder at Daphne, who had already turned away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this because of the Elliott Group?&#34; Millie asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of annoyance crossed Daphne&#39;s face when she realized Millie had figured it out, but she didn&#39;t bother hiding the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you really say you&#39;re not interested in working with the Elliott Group?&#34; Daphne asked. &#34;They run the jewelry and luxury business, which is great for our image. Usually, someone else from their team comes out, but this time Mr. Elliott himself showed up. That means they&#39;re taking this seriously!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Plus,&#34; Daphne added, giving Millie a curious look,&#34;you must know, even though the Elliott Group is just one of Crobert&#39;s big three, there&#39;s something mysterious about them. Actually, there&#39;s more to-wait, why am I even telling you all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie just smiled and kept her thoughts to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She actually knew more than Daphne was letting on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only the Elliott Group, but the Watson Group and Evans Group all had their own secrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was how those families had managed to hold their ground in Crobert,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m not planning to back out,&#34; Millie replied,seeing that everything that had happened recently was bound to make Daphne rethink her approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For the finals, we&#39;ll just have to rely on our own talent,&#34; Millie remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; Daphne snapped, reaching out as if she wanted to pull Millie&#39;s mask away and see who she really was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie caught on right away and moved Daphne&#39;s hand aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re crossing the line,&#34; Millie retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daphne pressed her lips together in frustration,giving Millie a hard stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not nearly as bad as you,&#34; Daphne responded sharply. &#34;Everyone knows you&#39;ve got Charles backing you. The whole industry has heard that you&#39;re his woman!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stared at Daphne. There was a time when she&#39;d found Daphne genuinely likable, but now she saw how wrong she&#39;d been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If people weren&#39;t fighting for their own interests,maybe things could stay friendly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever disputes arose, so did hidden grudges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My connection with Charles is strictly business,&#34;Millie explained in a steady voice, and whether or not Daphne chose to believe her wasn&#39;t her problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daphne only gave her a mocking sneer, clearly refusing to accept it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I earned my spot based on what I bring to the stage,&#34; Millie remarked, unwilling to let Daphne&#39;s.doubt go unanswered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No matter how much you try to defend yourself, it doesn&#39;t matter.&#34; Daphne sneered. &#34;Serena, you&#39;ll never escape the rumors about donation fraud and sleeping your way to the top. Your name&#39;s already in the mud. You might keep Charles in your corner,but the Elliott family and the public are sharper than you think. The Elliott Group is only here now because of the show&#39;s promise and the contestants&#39; real skill.Tricks won&#39;t keep working for you. I&#39;ll make sure I&#39;m the one who gets the Elliott family&#39;s support!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s eyes softened with pity as she looked at Daphne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was true that Daphne&#39;s talent made her a strong competitor, but she failed to see the bigger picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A staff member called out, &#34;Serena, it&#39;s time for rehearsal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gathering her things, Millie spared Daphne one last glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You remember how I was sabotaged in both earlier rounds. Do you call that getting ahead by cheating?&#34;With that, Millie walked onto the stage for rehearsal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some people simply couldn&#39;t be reasoned with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daphne refused to change her mind, continuing the argument would be a waste of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was also present, of course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, however, she kept her distance and didn&#39;t give Millie any trouble, which struck&lt;Millie as strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Vivian shot her a quick, smug look filled with disdain before disappearing backstage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once backstage, Vivian spotted Daphne sulking in the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no interest in Daphne&#39;s mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, a few sharp comments about Serena would have slipped out, but after the recent blackmail scare, she kept quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t be sure if anyone was secretly recording.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Serena stayed in the competition, what did it matter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever name Serena once had was already in shambles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Serena set foot on stage, Vivian planned to unleash a wave of online hate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could someone like her even think of standing up to Vivian?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, Vivian had gone easy on Serena,hoping they could work together against Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Serena honestly believe her luck would hold out forever?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every minute of the day seemed filled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie kept herself busy, hardly able to catch her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was so much to handle, she barely kept up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just a few days, taking off her mask would bring her face to face with Brandon and Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s warnings echoed in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how many times she went over her plans,nothing ever felt certain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Few people understood the Watson Group&#39;s strength as welI as Millie did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the rehearsal ended, she didn&#39;t seek Myron out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On her way out, though, she noticed his eyes following her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the Elliott Group acting as a sponsor, Millie gave a brief nod out of politeness before making her way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She managed a greeting that was just the right balance between formal and friendly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one around her would ever guess that just hours earlier, Myron had surprised her with a proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silent smile played on Myron&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her distance, but that didn&#39;t bother him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patience was his strong suit; he could wait as long as it took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around him, staff and contestants gathered after rehearsal, eager to say hello. Myron greeted everyone in a composed, even tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Vivian and Daphne came over to greet him as well, but Myron treated them just the same. By the time he glanced up again, Millie had already disappeared around the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel Myron&#39;s gaze, but she had no intention of staying any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After turning him down that morning, Millie saw no point in sending mixed signals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie came to the quiet realization that she had been far too tense lately and needed to give herself a chance to loosen up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that the divorce drama was over, she deserved to relax a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought made her reach for her phone, where she found a message from Charles in their group chat about where to meet tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles remarked, &#34;You&#39;re officially single again!Time to celebrate! Let&#39;s meet at Blue Lounge, book a private room, have some drinks and a good chat,and then dance and let loose for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia interjected, &#34;I&#39;m all for it! I&#39;ve been dying to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They say the guys there are gorgeous, but Giffard never lets me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giffard&#39;s reply came fast.&#34;Alexia!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia didn&#39;t let up. &#34;Giffard, come on, I&#39;m not going alone. We&#39;re going as a group, and I never said I&#39;d flirt with anyone-just making an observation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville chimed in as well, &#34;I&#39;m in! I want to go too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Charles turned the spotlight on Millie.&#34;What do you say, Millie? You&#39;re the guest of honor tonight,after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take Millie long to decide. Blue Lounge worked for everyone, and since the whole group was in their twenties, there was no need to worry about anyone being underage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied to the group, &#34;Sounds good! I&#39;ll see you all at Blue Lounge tonight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over on the other side of town, Brandon&#39;s phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long day on his feet, Brandon glanced at his phone and spotted a message from Darden,saying,&#34;Hey man, did the divorce go through? Feel like grabbing a drink at Blue Lounge?&#34;</p>
