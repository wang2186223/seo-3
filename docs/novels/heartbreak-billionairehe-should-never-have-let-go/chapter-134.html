                <p>Millie studied Myron, her gaze tracing the delicate swirl of steam rising from his coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through that soft haze, she took in the faint lines of exhaustion around his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; she asked quietly, her voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t seem disappointed when she ignored the cup he&#39;d offered. Myron simply set it onthe table between them, poured himself a fresh serving,and regarded her with gentle sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I admire you,&#34; he admitted, his tone unwavering.&#34;And I like you.Honestly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The confession didn&#39;t stir her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ache of her recent divorce was still too raw; no amount of admiration could make her want to leap blindly into another relationship tight away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just don&#39;t get it,&#34; Millie replied, lifting her eyes to meet his. &#34;There are plenty of other women you could pursue. I&#39;m nothing special.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head, conviction in every line of his face.&#34;You&#39;re wrong.You are special. There&#39;s no one else like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie hesitated, unsure how to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air between them turned oddly heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; she said after a long pause, her voice gentle but firm. &#34;I just can&#39;t think about any of this.right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze drifted to the untouched coffee cooling on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who brought up marriage like this-over a casual cup of coffee?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d barely finalized her divorce; all she wanted was a little peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of a second marriage was a question for  another time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was Ari to worry about now-her daughter came first, always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just her own future at stake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, her focus belonged elsewhere, like preparing for the Heavenly Melody finals, and taking the agreement she and Brandon signed to the lawyer.She needed to fight for what remained of the Bennett family&#39;s old business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron glanced at Millie, his gaze steady and,unhurried, a gentle warmth lingering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If marriage is out of the question, what about a partnership instead?&#34; he offered, his voice as calm as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie arched a brow, caught off guard. &#34;A partnership?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He replied with a nod, unruffled, &#34;You&#39;re divorced,but everyone still sees you as Brandon&#39;s ex-wife.And you know as well as I do, once Vivian is gone,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon will try to win you back. How do you plan to handle that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was rational, almost soothing. &#34;Maybe you and Charles want to stand together and help each other get ahead. But you know it&#39;s not that simple.Charles needs time, and he&#39;s up against Reuben and Oakley-neither of them are easy opponents. The Watson Group is too powerful for him right now.And you... As capable as you are, Millie, one person cannot take on an entire corporation alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned forward, voice even and direct. &#34;Say you try to stall for time-how long can you keep it up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron laid out the facts without a hint of accusation,just honest concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood that proposing marriage so suddenly might seem inappropriate, but the truth was, too many men already wanted Millie for themselves. He couldn&#39;t afford to hold back any longer, not if he hoped to stand a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My apologies,&#34; Myron went on, his voice gentle but steady. &#34;Maybe it was out of line to bring up marriage so soon. That&#39;s not my only solution. There are other ways to give you some protection. If marriage feels too much, we could get engaged, or I could simply act as your boyfriend in public.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie sat in silence, her gaze fixed on the steaming coffee,lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could see Myron wasn&#39;t wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron waited, and then offered, &#34;Three months.Let&#39;s just try this for twelve weeks-one meeting each week. We don&#39;t have to force anything. You don&#39;t have to pressure yourself to feel anything for me. But during that time, if there are rumors about us, or if people assume we&#39;ll engaged soon, it might shield you from a lot of trouble. And if, after three months, you want nothing to do with me, we&#39;ll walk away,no strings attached.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She observed him across the table, taking in his composed expression as the scent of coffee drifted between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron looked as collected as ever, unfazed by his own bold proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The arrangement sounded strangely appealing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she couldn&#39;t help but ask, &#34;Why are you doing this? Is it really just because you like me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned, searching his face for a hint of deeper motive. She honestly couldn&#39;t imagine what about her could inspire that kind of devotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want another reason...&#34; Myron&#39;s smile curved with a hint of mischief. &#34;Let&#39;s just say I&#39;d rather not make things so easy for Brandon-or the Watson Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in, his tone softening. &#34;You probably don&#39;t realize it, Millie, but I envy him. Not because of his money or his status. Not even the Watson Group.I envy the fact that he once had someone who gave him everything-someone who&#39;d risk it all just for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s gaze dropped to the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Risk everything, just for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t that just foolishness?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d done it. Seven years, and what did she have to show for it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll think about it,&#34; she murmured, her voice low with exhaustion. &#34;I can&#39;t give you an answer right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just felt so tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seven years with Brandon had drained her. The idea of diving into a new relationship left her hollow and wary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered if she was even capable of falling in love again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marriage without love? The thought also made her chest tighten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me,&#34; Millie murmured, giving a polite nod before she quietly rose and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron remained in his seat, watching her retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coffee she&#39;d left behind sat untouched,wisps of steam curling in the morning light. He gazed at the cup, a gentle smile tugging at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she no longer believed she could love, maybe he could be the one to love her first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the cafe, MMillie sank into the driver&#39;s seat of her car and exhaled, letting the tension slip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least she didn&#39;t have to deal with Myron pressing her for answers anymore.Everything else could wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, she&#39;d finally closed the</p>
