                <p>When Vivian opened the door, Brandon found himself surprised by the scene before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian greeted him,wearing only a delicate nightgown with thin straps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint frown creased Brandon&#39;s brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence between them lingered, as Vivian, clearly aware of her appearance, refused to meet his eyes and kept her head lowered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of commenting, Brandon shrugged off his jacket and gently placed it around her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go inside. You&#39;ll catch a chill out here,&#34; said Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Vivian gave a small nod and stepped aside,letting him in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes drifted over Brandon, quickly picking up on his freshly changed shirt and trousers-a different set from earlier that day when he left her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his new clothes made it obvious he had</p>
                
                
                
                <p>gotten dressed again before arriving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Puzzlement crept in-what possible reason did Brandon have to change, especially when he had spent the evening with Millie under the same roof?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation simmered the longer Vivian dwelled on that thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all the effort she put into taking Millie&#39;s place in Brandon&#39;s life, she now faced his meddlesome grandparents and the threat of a child who seemed to come out of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One misstep, and it could ruin everything Vivian had fought for. What if Millie got pregnant again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, brooding over the situation wouldn&#39;t help.Vivian forced herself to remain calm, knowing that composure was her only weapon now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a spot beside Brandon, Vivian dabbed at her eyes, trying to muffle her sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertainty crept into Brandon&#39;s expression as he watched her, not knowing what to say or do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, he found his voice. &#34;Can you try to stop crying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That only made Vivian&#39;s shoulders shake harder, her tears coming faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Red-rimmed eyes searched his face as she reached up,clutching at his collar in desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s brow furrowed as he gently removed her hand from his shirt. &#34;What are you trying to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears fell freely as Vivian choked out her question.&#34;You promised you&#39;d leave her-you told me you were getting a divorce. Why did you end up with her anyway? It hurts so much, Brandon. I can&#39;t take it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of helplessness washed over Brandon as he looked into her tear-streaked face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met for a long moment before he finally spoke. &#34;I didn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat of silence passed before he added, &#34;Millie and I didn&#39;t do anything. My grandparents just insisted on breakfast tomorrow. That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s heart lifted at his words. &#34;Is that the truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away, Brandon responded with a quiet, &#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of satisfaction crossed Vivian&#39;s mind once she realized Brandon wasn&#39;t hiding anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie couldn&#39;t accomplish anything,even with all the support in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sideways glance at Brandon filled Vivian with</p>
                
                
                
                <p>confidence; she believed she finally had control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what Millie did-even if she tried to tempt him in the most obvious ways-Vivian was certain Brandon would remain indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite these smug thoughts, Vivian let her tears fall for effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winning Brandon over fully was her true goal; after that,everything else would fall into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea emboldened her, so she shifted closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice dropped to a whisper as she leaned in, her breath warm against him. &#34;Brandon...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight&#39;s preparations hadn&#39;t been for nothing. She had chosen her nightgown carefully and dabbed on a fragrance designed to pull him closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Vivian let herself rest against his shoulder,the image of vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a gentle tone, she said, &#34;I&#39;m sorry for doubting you.I just... couldn&#39;t help but worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon discreetly shifted away from her, hoping to put a bit more space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon catching Brandon&#39;s retreat, Vivian&#39;s reddened eyes fixed on him. &#34;Why are you pulling away from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t meet her gaze, instead asking quietly,&#34;Are you feeling all right? Is everything okay with your health?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That question gave Vivian pause; she mistook his retreat for concern about her well-being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shy flush colored her cheeks as she answered, &#34;I&#39;m fine. I just want you to stay with me tonight. Please?I really am okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of them knew exactly what her invitation meant -there was no need for subtlety between adults.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than feeling drawn in, Brandon felt tension building in his temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s intentions were perfectly clear, and still, he couldn&#39;t find any interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her alluring nightgown and the perfume she had carefully chosen, his body and mind simply wouldn&#39;t respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desire was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edging closer, Vivian reached for his hand and tried to guide it to her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was enough-Brandon pushed himself up from the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon?&#34; Vivian called after him, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing away, he spoke in an even tone. &#34;You&#39;re not well.Get some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tremor crept into Vivian&#39;s question. &#34;Is there something about me you just don&#39;t like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No response came fromn Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears made her words wobble. &#34;Why is she allowed,but I&#39;m not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left nothing hidden. &#34;I want to be with you,Brandon. Can&#39;t we just have this one night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s feelings didn&#39;t change. There was no spark,no interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making for the door, he tossed out a reason. &#34;I need to go. Grandma expects me for breakfast tomorrow morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s cry stopped him in his tracks, raw and pleading.&#34;Brandon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spinning around, Brandon caught sight of her, utterly exposed and shaking with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streaked her cheeks as she begged. &#34;Why can&#39;t you just give me what I want,just this once?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitating, he shut the door behind him to keep her out of the possible prying eyes from the hallway and moved toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gently, he gathered her clothes and draped them over her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was tired, stripped of all pretense. &#34;I just don&#39;t have it in me tonight. I&#39;m completely worn out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Absolutely no desire stirred within him, not even the faintest hint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nakedness did nothing to bridge the distance between them; Brandon felt empty inside as he looked at Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He managed only a quiet, &#34;Take care of yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s sobs grew louder, pain cracking through each breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A desperate plea tumbled out. &#34;But you promised,Brandon. You said you&#39;d grant my wish. I&#39;m running out of time, and you still won&#39;t touch me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked further, voice trembling, &#34;Is it Millie? Do you still love her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streaming down her face, Vivian kept begging.&#34;Just once-please. Pretend I&#39;m her if you have to.l just want you tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That shattered image of Millie, her face stained with tears, flashed across Brandon&#39;s mind, confusion twisting inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept his tone gentle but distant. &#34;Try get some rest. I&#39;m leaving now. The doctor will come by to check on you soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s scream echoed in the room, ragged with heartbreak. &#34;I don&#39;t want a doctor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing over his shoulder, Brandon caught the raw question in her eyes. &#34;Is it... do you think I&#39;m unclean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Utterly undone, Vivian broke down. &#34;All this time,you&#39;ve never touched me. Is it because of what happened that day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shoulders drooping, Brandon stayed silent, his hands balled tight at his sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A harsh,humorless laugh broke from Vivian. &#34;I knew it.I&#39;m cheap. I&#39;m filthy.&#34; Regret crept into her voice. &#34;But this isn&#39;t what I ever wanted, Brandon...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t bring herself to finish the sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words left her utterly drained, her body giving out as she collapsed in a heap, racked with sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stood motionless, watching her fall apart on the floor,his right hand beginning to shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments ticked by before he finally crouched beside her and held out a tissue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a voice barely above a whisper, he said, &#34;You&#39;re not to blame for any of it. I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the doctor Brandon had called knocked on the door. He gently helped Vivian into her clothes and invited the doctor inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One look at the doctor and Vivian&#39;s eyes filled with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry gnawed at her, terrified of her secrets being exposed.</p>
