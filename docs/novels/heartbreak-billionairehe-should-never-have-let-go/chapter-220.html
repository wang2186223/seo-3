                <p>On the left side of the screen was Millie&#39;s stream. On the right, Vivian&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Millie walked confidently ahead, leading a select group of visitors into the golden river of time surrounded by sunflowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were about twenty of them, all handpicked by the Elliott Group-some were journalists, some potential buyers, and a few just curious onlookers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they stepped into the field, Millie addressed them with a warm smile. &#34;This is where it begins. It&#39;s quite the walk, so you can leave anything you don&#39;t need in the baskets beside you.&#34; She gestured toward the baskets tucked among the flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were plenty of baskets, enough for everyone to set down their things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were done, the group followed Millie deeper into the sunflower sea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tour began outdoors. Sunlight poured down, making the sunflowers glow with life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath their feet, the river of petals shimmered with every step, as if it had a pulse of its own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every now and then, golden flashes caught the eye-reflections from the sun hitting hidden picture frames</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait... What&#39;s that?&#34; someone asked, pointing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked to her assistant, who quickly stepped forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am, I&#39;Il show you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two walked toward the glint. The sunflowers parted like curtains, revealing a gilded frame. Inside were vintage black-and-white photos, each marked with a year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look-street scenes from 1935.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not just street scenes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are real-life moments from back then!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at this one-people actually wore wedding gowns like this in 1935!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photos had captured everything-weddings, laughter, daily life. Framed by the golden field and bathed in sunlight, the past didn&#39;t feel so far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one wedding photo, the bride held a bouquet of sunflowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a woman admired the images, she didn&#39;t notice something hidden in the frames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tiny gemstones-sparkling in soft yellow tones-were woven into the design.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she reached the final photo, a hand appeared beside her. It held a sunflower made entirely of gems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling, she offered the immortal bloom. Behind her, the old photo of the bride beamed from 1935.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, on Vivian&#39;s stream, her assistant focused the camera on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, the screen seemed to freeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Millie&#39;s smiling face appeared on one side, Vivian&#39;s camera caught the wedding portrait of Millie and Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The timing couldn&#39;t have been more awkward. The frame paused-but then cut to Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The irony didn&#39;t go unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian spoke softly, &#34;Today&#39;s floral design is part of the artist series.&#34; She picked out a few Teddy Bear Sunflowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With quick, graceful hands, she arranged them into a small bouquet-simple and elegant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Van Gogh&#39;s Sunflowers,&#34; she said into the lens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up the vase and nodded at her assistant. The camera panned slowly across the room,catching glimpses of the mansion&#39;s decor but always returning to Vivian and her flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They moved from the kitchen to the dining area, and then into the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian stopped beneath a massive wedding portrait-Millie and Brandon&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set the sunflower bouquet right below it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it fits perfectly here. Don&#39;t you agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was soft, almost fragile, but her words carried a sharp sting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Internet lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s bold! Vivian&#39;s going straight for Millie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Millie? Does she know what&#39;s happening? Someone on-site, quickly connect with Millie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian, Millie&#39;s going live too. Dare to link up with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s assistant began reading some of the comments out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Viewers urged her to go live with Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian gave a pale smile to the camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that&#39;s what everyone wants... I&#39;ll doit. Though I worry it might be a bit much for Millie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned to her assistant and nodded. They opened MAillie&#39;s live feed and sent a connection request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this really okay?&#34; she asked quietly, her tone uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back on Millie&#39;s stream, she was mid-introduction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie explained, &#34;There is a printer here. You can print your favorite photo and leave your address. The Elliott Group will keep it for five years, and then send it back to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pointed to the frames-some hidden in flowers, others stored in a capsule labeled &#34;time mailbox.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Vivian&#39;s connection request popped up. Viewers flooded the screen with comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Accept it! What are you scared of? Vivian&#39;s ready-don&#39;t back down, Milfie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on! We want fireworks!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stood in the middle of the street. People on nearby balconies shouted down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pick it up, Millie! Don&#39;t be a coward!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft chuckle, Millie reached out and accepted the request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen split-and Millie came face to face with Vivian, who stood beneath her old wedding photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MAillie,&#34; Vivian said, her voice dripping with sweetness and spite. &#34;What do you think of my flowers? Van Gogh&#39;s Sunflowers. Do they suit the photo? Do you like them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone held their breath, waiting for Millie to snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She only smiled. &#34;I think they&#39;re lovely. A perfect match.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she looked past the camera and gave a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a surprise too,&#34; Millie said, smiling</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her assistant walked over with a large frame, covered in cloth. Curious eyes followed as the camera zoomed in.Millie pulled the cloth away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside was a perfect replica of her wedding photo with Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled sweetly. &#34;Miss Simpson, I heard you&#39;re quite fond of this wedding photo of mine. So, I had a special copy printed just for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woah! Didn&#39;t see that coming!&#34; The crowd on the balconies roared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cheers and laughter rang out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment was electric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunlight caught Millie&#39;s face just right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know everyone&#39;s been dying to hear about me and my ex-husband. You keep pushing, so fine-l&#39;ll give you a story,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted the frame and carried it into the sunflowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, she picked up a flower planter and slammed the photo into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Golden light danced across her face as the wedding photo stood among the blooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie turned to the camera, her eyes bright. &#34;Do you like it?&#34; she asked, echoing Vivian&#39;s question with a smile.</p>
