                <p>Myron swept his gaze across the room one final time before extinguishing the lights and drawing the door closed behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He descended the staircase with deliberate steps,each footfall echoing softly in the quiet house; then he settled into his chair in the living room to observe Jayceon&#39;s patient training session with Kiki, their plump ragdoll cat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fluffy feline was mastering the art of interactive play under Jayceon&#39;s watchful guidance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep those claws tucked away,&#34; Jayceon coached the feline with endless patience. &#34;Do you understand me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meow~&#34; Kiki responded with perfect obedience,settling into a poised sitting position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Myron appeared downstairs, Jayceon rose immediately from his crouched position,scooping Kiki into his arms with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myron,&#34; he began, cradling the cat against his chest, &#34;I&#39;ve secured a place of my own and I&#39;m planning to relocate soon. When do you think you&#39;ll be ready to bring Ari and Millie here to stay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Adriana had her own place, Jayceon had shared this mansion with Myron for years, a natural arrangement since he held the position of the youngest in their close-knit family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s fingers found the sweet spot beneath Kiki&#39;s chin, scratching gently as he considered his response. &#34;That might require more time than we&#39;d hoped.Millie still needs more preparation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon acknowledged this with a slow nod, though confusion flickered across his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how are matters progressing between you and Miss McCoy?&#34; Myron inquired with studied casualness. Jayceon&#39;s head shook with immediate, almost frantic denial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing exists between us-those are merely baseless rumors circulating without foundation,&#34; he muttered, his words tumbling together in embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron regarded him with a penetrating stare, allowed a knowing smile to curve his lips, and then chose to leave the subject unexplored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, across the city in the hotel&#39;s elegant lobby, Egbert had barely crossed the threshold when the desk clerk approached with professional courtesy. &#34;Mr. Perez, you have someone waiting for your return upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert found this development peculiar. He wasn&#39;t expecting anyone-who could possibly be seeking his company?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He acknowledged the information with a thoughtful nod and made his way to the elevator, his mind turning over possibilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon reaching his suite&#39;s entrance, the mystery resolved itself-Babette stood waiting in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without making any move to unlock his door, Egbert addressed her directly, &#34;What pressing circumstances bring you to my doorstep at this hour?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette rose gracefully from her waiting position-today she had chosen her attire with particular care and strategic attention to detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cradled an ornate decorative box in her manicured hands, lifting the lid to reveal an elegant bottle of deep red wine nestled within silk padding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; wanted to present you with this gift,&#34; Babette explained, her voice carrying rehearsed warmth.&#34;This vintage comes from my famly&#39;s private vineyard, and it holds special meaning for me. l hoped you might also appreciate its flavor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>examined the wine with measured interest before accepting it from her outstretched hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well, I&#39;ll receive your offering,&#34; he stated with formal politeness. &#34;My gratitude for y/our thoughtfulness-you may depart now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pivoted toward his door with decisive movement,key already positioned in his palm, preparing to disappear inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Egbert.&#34; Babette&#39;s voice rang out with desperate urgency, stepping directly into his path to block his retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there something additional you need to discuss?&#34;Egbert asked, his brow creasing with slight annoyance as he regarded her persistence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you still mad at me?&#34; Babette pressed, her words rushing together. &#34;Because I took the wine with me and later show her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert offered no verbal response, simply allowing his gaze to settle upon her upturned face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Egbert, she&#39;s already experienced both marriage and divorce,&#34; Babette declared with pointed emphasis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert had no desire to continue this conversation,turning once again toward his sanctuary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even though she&#39;s separated herself from Brandon now, she&#39;s already begun pursuing a new romantic connection. You cannot possess her heart!&#34; Babette declared, her determination overriding her dignity.&#34;Egbert, every effort you&#39;re making amounts to wasted energy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette positioned herself directly in Egbert&#39;s path,craning her neck upward to meet his towering gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why can&#39;t your eyes truly see me?&#34; Her eyes brimmed with unshed tears. &#34;Everything she&#39;s capable of offering you, I can provide as well-and more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert released a deep, weary sigh, and then extended the wine bottle back toward Babette&#39;s trembling hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should probably take this back and leave,&#34; he stated with finality, unlocking his door and stepping across the threshold, already moving to shut her out.But Babette pressed her full weight against the door&#39;s surface, preventing its closure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you choose to rescue me that day?&#34; she cried out, her voice breaking with raw emotion.&#34;Wouldn&#39;t everything have been simpler if you had simply allowed death to claim me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert applied firm pressure, forcing her back into the hallway, and then secured the door between them with finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind drifted back to that fateful night, and the truth settled heavily in his chest. The entire rescue had been built on a fundamental misunderstanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had believed the Watson Group&#39;s contact person was Millie, so when he learned the woman connected to that deal faced mortal danger, he had personally intervened without hesitation-only that woman turned out to be Babette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Babette deserved no explanation for his actions -the truth would only complicate matters further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As night descended over the city, casting long shadows across the streets, Elliott Group&#39;s Blue series campaign ignited a photography craze among the general public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crowds swarmed enthusiastically in the space between the two massive advertising screens,everyone eager to capture the perfect shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, that particular section terminated in a dead end, with virtually no vehicle traffic on the opposite side, and the city had implemented a partial road closure lasting two precious hours each evening to accommodate the surge of visitors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ownership details carried little significance since the Elliott Group held title to the entire district surrounding the installation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who had invested in the Blue series and captured photographs alongside their purchases discovered the most breathtaking results-the evening illumination reflecting off the precious gemstones cast an ethereal blue radiance,transforming each person into a figure suspended within a temporal rift between dimensions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vast &#34;ocean&#34; stretching endlessly before them and the towering 3D screens flanking either side enhanced the otherworldly sensation of standing balanced between parallel universes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even individuals who had bypassed purchasing from the Blue series experienced some measure of the enchanting effect, though their photos lacked the same dramatic intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Social media platforms became saturated with countless videos and images flooding every feed,igniting passionate discussions that spread like wildfire across the digital landscape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard this entire concept originated from Millie&#39;s creative vision-she architected every single detail of this masterpiece!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This represents pure genius in action! It easily surpasses those tediously monotonous activities that plagued each Christmas brand event by astronomical measures!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely agreed, and that accompanying song delivers incredible impact too. I&#39;d wager my savings that Millie wielded significant influence in its creation!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When discussing Eva&#39;s involvement, I must confess I&#39;ve always perceived her as the undisputed champion of claiming abandoned opportunities. The identical pattern emerged during the entire Vivian situation previously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian bears no fault in this matter. Her heart simply yearned for the sacred ceremony of marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amid the escalating debates and heated exchanges,an unexpected hashtag materialized with sudden force-#VivianLuxuryVillaFloralSeries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie and Vivian had occupied the epicenter of public conversation for weeks, and Vivian&#39;s breaking news swiftly claimed the coveted top position on trending lists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Social media users buzzed with anticipation and speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At precisely this moment, Millie had just emerged from her refreshing shower, droplets still clinging to her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the unfolding news coverage and allowed a cold, knowing smirk to curve across her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had indeed executed her carefully planned maneuver with precision timing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Millie contemplated the implications, another trending hashtag burst into prominence-#VivianLiveBroadcast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The streaming backdrop displayed stark, clinical whiteness, and Vivian appeared ghostly pale against its harsh contrast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She manufactured a smile for the camera, though the expression seemed strained and artificial. &#34;My assistant informed me that countless supporters have expressed genuine concern about my well-being, so l decided to initiate this live streaming session.&#34; Vivian then coughed, her appearance radiating unmistakable illness, her eyes transformed into bloodshot pools from the relentless coughing spasms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She managed a weak smile despite her obvious discomfort. &#34;You represent my most loyal supporters, functioning almost like business partners in this journey. Today, as I witness everyone&#39;s fascination with my ongoing competition against Millie, I feel compelled to provide you with a comprehensive update on my recent developments.First, &#39;Love of Vivian&#39; currently navigates the complex process of securing theatrical distribution rights, and considerable time may pass before audiences can experience it in cinema venues. Second, I&#39;ve rekindled memories of how your awareness of my work initially blossomed-through my signature luxury villa floral series. I pledge to resurrect this beloved project, and this time, it shall continue flourishing until my final breath leaves my body.Finally, some among you may have discovered that Watson Group has completely severed all operational ties with &#39;Love of Vivian, a development that has prompted extensive self-reflection on my part. I will not possess Watson Group&#39;s formidable support during this crucial battle, but my conscience remains completely unburdened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed to drift into painful memories, her expression shifting toward profound melancholy.&#34;Perhaps my desires grew too ambitious, nurturing hopes for a beautiful wedding ceremony... But such disappointments are manageable. Millie and | will each demonstrate our individual talents without external assistance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brightened with renewed determination. &#34;Finally,I hope each of you will champion my luxury villa floral series project with your unwavering support.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After delivering her carefully crafted message, Vivian claimed exhaustion had  overtaken her and disconnected from the broadcast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Vivian monitored the hashtag&#39;s popularity ascending to extraordinary heights, deep satisfaction flooded her calculating eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier that day, Brandon had presented her with two distinct options for moving forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had rejected both alternatives but countered with her own demand instead. &#34;Brandon, you needn&#39;t concern yourself with &#39;Love of Vivian&#39;s&#39; fate. That project has already separated from the Watson Group completely and I&#39;ll take care of everything from here, but you absolutely must assist me with my luxury villa floral series initiative. Brandon,your heart desires my victory, doesn&#39;t it? If you truly want me to triumph, if genuine love exists within your heart for me, then grant me this solemn promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During that tense conversation, Brandon had offered no verbal response, merely directing her to establish contact with Eugene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s smile widened with triumphant knowledge that Brandon remained firmly positioned on her síde,his resolve too weak to deny her compelling requests.</p>
