                <p>Millie thought back to her days with Brandon. Such moments like this never seemed to happen between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was simply that children were never part of their lives before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron and Ari seemed to have come to some quiet understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced up at Millie. &#34;Is this time and place alright for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jolted from her thoughts, Millie remembered what they&#39;d been discussing and gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari drifted off to her drawing, leaving Millie and Myron facing each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when Millie realized that the office was suddenly just the three of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere felt a little odd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did Alexia go?&#34; Millie finally broke the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I got here, shé was clearing having some stomach issues and asked me to watch Ari fora minute.She said she&#39;d be back soon,&#34; Myron replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s eyes flicked to the security camera, its tiny light blinking steadily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alright then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her attention back to Myron. &#34;Mr. Elliott, did you stop by to see someone, or are you not feeling well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron just smiled. &#34;Actually, I came to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;sbrows drew together, but she held her gaze on him, not saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have a minute?&#34; Myron asked, his voice soft as he smiled. &#34;Would you mind coming downstairs with me? We can bring Ari with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie paused for a mnoment and then nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he wanted her to bring Ari along, it probably wasn&#39;t anything sensitive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll leave a note for Alexia,&#34; Millie offered, moving to jot down a message on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Myron replied, watching quietly as she wrote.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>·.·</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere,Brandon hadn&#39;t moved from where he stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood trickled from the corner of his lips, leaving tiny red marks on the floor at his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stranger passing by spotted his condition and quickly called out for a nurse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse tended to Brandon&#39;s injuries, cleaned himn up, and pressed an ice pack into his hand before letting him go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Brandon found himself alone on a bench at the end of the hallway, ice pack pressed to his cheek, his thoughts a tangled mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gazed absently through the window, watching the scene below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A door nearby opened, and someone came out to sit quietly beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon.&#34; A voice spoke gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon lifted his head to find Vivian there, her complexion washed out and pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing out here?&#34; Brandon asked with a faint frown, his gaze falling on the fresh bandage around her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s eyes lingered on his bruised face instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to you?&#34; she murmured, her eyes rimmed red. &#34;Why do you look so beat up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon shook his head, his attention never leaving her bandaged arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing serious,&#34; Vivian said softly, following his line of sight. &#34;The doctors wrapped it up. It&#39;ll heal soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry, Brandon. This is all my fault,&#34; she said as a tear slipped down her cheek. &#34;I keep making things worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon dodged Vivian&#39;s outstretched hand, his eyes dropping to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian,&#34; he said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian blinked back at him, voice fragile.&#34;Yeah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a steady breath. &#34;Don&#39;t ever hurt yourself again,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian forced a small, shaky smile. &#34;I promise. You don&#39;t have to worry.&#34;	0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked so fragile, heartbreak written across her features. &#34;I don&#39;t even know what came over me,and I just lost control for a minute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;ll do better,&#34; she added, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon finally looked up, his eyes dark and searching as he met her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian shifted uncomfortably, a hint of worry in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, is something bothering you?&#34; she asked gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t answer right away. Instead, he turned his eyes back to the window, the silence stretching between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow shake of his head was all the reply she got.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, on the far edge of the clearing near the building, a handful of people had suddenly appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were too distant to make out, just moving shapes he couldn&#39;t quite place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, for some reason, those little figures captured his focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out in the clearing, Millíie, Ari, and Myron made their way across the lawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron stepped aside, heading to a nearby bush and searching around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie kept a gentle hold on Ari&#39;s hand, watching curiously as Myron went back with a small bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lucky for us, no one found this stash while I was gone,&#34;Myron said, pulling out several cylinder-shaped objects.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie leaned in, intrigued. &#34;What are those?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron handed one over to her. &#34;Fireworks. Not the big, loud kind. These just make a little noise,nothing crazy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered another one to Ari,smiling.&#34;Ari, is this okay for you? I know your condition and that you shouldn&#39;t be too excited.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie studied the small fireworks, the kind you placed on the ground and watched as they shot up colorful sparks. Before she could say anything, Ari chimned in with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can do it,&#34; Ari said ,confidently. &#34;We had these on Christmas Eve at the children&#39;s home, the director lit some for us. They were beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie called Alexia to double-check, who gave her a positive reply, so she agreed to let Ari stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron was already crouched down, arranging the fireworks across the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting Ari into her arms, Millie gently covered the little girl&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first firework hissed, and then burst into clusters of light, dancing along the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow!&#34; Ari&#39;s laughter bubbled out as she clapped her hands, delighted by the show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie couldn&#39;t help but smile, letting her hands drop from Ari&#39;s ears as the sparks kept flying</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, surrounded by the flickering lights, Millie&#39;s own sadness melted away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were supposed to have a drone fireworks display tonight.&#34; Myron spoke up quietly beside her. &#34;But...after everything that happened, it got canceled. I didn&#39;t want the day to go by without something special, so I brought these for you instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gazed at the glowing embers, the meaning behind his gesture clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everything that happened with Vivian&#39;s suicide attempt, putting on a big fireworks display for Millie would have just added fuel to the gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Myron and softly asked,&#34;Why go to all this trouble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Iheard there were fireworks for both your wedding and the night before your divorce,&#34; Myron said softly.&#34;I know he caused you a lot of pain, and I didn&#39;t want fireworks to always remind you of him. That&#39;s why,after you won the Heavenly Melody championship, I planned a fireworks display just for you. I hoped that from now on, when you saw fireworks, you&#39;d think of this moment, your victory, instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated, and then quietly added, &#34;And maybe think of me, too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie watched the brilliant bursts of light, every explosion scattering sparkling embers across the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gradually,she shifted her gaze away from the dazzling fireworks and let her eyes settle on Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t watching the show at all as his attention had been on her the entire time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a gentle smile on his face. &#34;It&#39;s a shame they didn&#39;t get their big debut,&#34; he said, almost wistfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fireworks&#39; glow played across his striking features, lending him an almost ethereal charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze never left her, shadowed by a quiet sorrow and a touch of longing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that gaze, it was as if she were the only thing he saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile finally broke across Millie&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was time for a fresh start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps she was ready for something-and someone-new, after all.</p>
