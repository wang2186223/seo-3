                <p>If anyone had to be contacted in MAillie&#39;s family,Brandon-still legally her husband-would be the first name on that list. But Rita set the thought aside, just for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Medication will help,&#34; she said gently. &#34;But you&#39;ll still&#39;need regular sessions with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded, already aware of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s try hypnosis today,&#34; Rita said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hypnosis...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie paused, considering it. Then she gave a quiet nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She followed Rita over to the couch and slowly lay down, closing her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her eyelids shut and her mind drifted away, everything turned dark and scattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, her mind cleared, and she found herself standing in the dim light of a grey, overcast day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long before Millie realized exactly where she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fluorescent lights were cold and sharp. The stillness around her was heavy, like a thick fog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In front of her was her father&#39;s corpse, wrapped.tightly in white cloth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered this day-years ago, when she had been called in to identify him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother had been sobbing uncontrollably beside her, but Millie could barely move. She had just stood there, eyes locked on her father&#39;s pale, battered face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That year, he had jumped from a high-rise building.After that, their family had collapsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory morphed. Suddenly, she was standing in front of the Bennett Group building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her father&#39;s blood and brain matter were splattered across the pavement-red mixed with white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood still, unable to move, staring into her father&#39;s eyes-eyes that refused to rest in peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around her was chaos-loud voices, arguments,screams from her mother that tore through the noise.And people-so many people-circling them like vultures, ready to tear off whatever remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to fight them off, Millie was shoved, falling straight into her father&#39;s blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everywhere,teeth and claws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then-shoes. A pair of polished shoes appeared in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Watson family will protect Millie from now on.&#34;She knew that voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up. There he was. Young Brandon. Still a teenager, but already standing like a man who knew how to lead.He wore his school uniform neatly, and his eyes-calm and unwavering-felt like magic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If anything happens,&#34; he said, &#34;come to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his signal, people behind him sprang into action.Everything that had felt out of control suddenly fell into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd backed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crouched beside her, pulled out a handkerchief,and gently wiped her bloodstained cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come with me,&#34; he said, holding out his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took it. It was warm and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the present, a tear slid down the cheek of the 25-year-old Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her eyes slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So much had happened since then.Brandon had stepped in. He had taken her and her mother away from the disaster, using his family&#39;s power to settle the mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bennett family still crumbled. The title of a rich heiress disappeared. The life of comfort and wealth vanished. But she and her mother had survived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she not have loved him after that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet-letting go had happened all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie closed her eyes again. Her brows drew together as pain pressed into her chest and reached her fingertips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita had been watching quietly. She exhaled slowly.&#34;It doesn&#39;t seem like you&#39;ve really let go of him,&#34; she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t answer right away. She sat up,taking her time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with the edge of her hand, she wiped away the tear.When her eyes met Rita&#39;s again, they were clear.Steady. &#34;I have,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was behind her would stay there. Now was now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie knew she had to face the mess left behind by the Bennett family on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon had chosen Vivian. That decision had shattered her, but it was also the、closure she needed. There was nothing left for her to hold on to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like when her mother remarried-everyone had their own path, and this time, Millie was choosing hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had made up her mind to let go. Slowly but surely, she was moving on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita listened carefully and nodded, absorbing every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her clinic wasn&#39;t part of any hospital. It was a private,upscale facility that offered peace, discretion, and full medical services-designed for wealthy clientsRecords were kept in-house only, never entered into public hospital databases. That was why Millie had picked this place in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want anyone to know what she was going through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even Alexia, her best friend, knew about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After their session, Rita wrote her a prescription.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie accepted the small bottle of pills, tucked it in her bag, and walked back to her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dosage was printed clearly on the label.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a bottle of water right there in the cup holder. She could take the first tablet now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes dropped to her belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not yet. She would wait until the pregnancy was terminated. A few more days wouldn&#39;t changeanything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie placed the bottle back in her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her phone buzzed-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dozens of notifications lighting up her screen on the show Heavenly Melody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tapped into them, her brow furrowing as she saw the trending topics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>#VivianMusicShow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>#VivianHeavenlyMelody</p>
                
                
                
                <p>#VivianPureAngel</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the links was a new video from Vivian&#39;s social media channel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian appeared in frame-delicate as ever, her body slightly hunched but her smile unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked soft, pale, and graceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, the producers of Heavenly Melody invited me,&#34;she said, smiling gently. &#34;I looked into the show&#39;sconcept and really liked it, so l accepted. I&#39;ll be a guest judge during the first live broadcast of the show in a few days. I hope you&#39;ll watch. And because it&#39;s a music show,&#34; she added, &#34;I&#39;ve also prepared an original song.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were red, her face almost translucent under the lighting, like a porcelain doll placed in the middle of her flower studio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Knowing I don&#39;t have much time left,&#34; she continued, &#34;I&#39;ve reflected on love, hurt,despair...and all the pieces of my life. That&#39;s where the song came from. It&#39;ll be released on streaming platforms at the same time as the live show. I hope it brings strength to anyone going through something painful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The camera panned slightly to show her bowing amid a lush spread of blossoms inside her studio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the video, an entertainment page had already published commentary. &#34;Sources say Vivian&#39;s original song is breathtaking. She composed, wrote, and performed it herself. Many people in the recording studio reportedly cried whenthey heard it. It turns out Vivian&#39;s not only a top-tier florist-she&#39;s a talented songwriter too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comments kept rolling in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short 25-second instrumental clip of Vivian&#39;s &#34;original&#34; song had been leaked and was already taking over the Internet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long before content creators began using the audio as background music for their videos -and each one went viral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Comment sections overflowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| can&#39;t believe Vivian is this good at songwriting. I&#39;ve been playing those 25 seconds on loop and looking forward to the full song!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s so talented. Beautiful, successful, now writing songs-and she&#39;s dying? Only six months to live. It&#39;s too sad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie spent her whole life trying to make a name,and now she&#39;s been overshadowed by Vivian&#39;s 25seconds.&#34;</p>
