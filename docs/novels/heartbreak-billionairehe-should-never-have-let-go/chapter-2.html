                <p>The next day, parked just outside the courthouse,Brandon sat in his Maybach, quietly tapping the steering wheel with his left hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, you and Millie have been married for a year now. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time to start planning for a baby?&#34; An elderly voice drifted from the phone&#39;s speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s face softened, a trace of frustration flickering through, but his patience didn&#39;t waver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma, we&#39;re still young. There&#39;s no need to rush.You and Grandpa should focus on staying healthy.He...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by &#39;There&#39;s no need to rush&#39;?&#34;The elderly voice rose in annoyance. &#34;Your.grandfather&#39;s condition might have improved,but we&#39;re not getting any younger. We don&#39;t know how much time we&#39;ve got left.&#34;&#34;Grandma...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t give me that! I&#39;ve heard things, Brandon.Whatever&#39;s going on, be good to Millie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell over the line for a few seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, did you hear me?&#34; the elder asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon rubbed his forehead in frustration. &#34;|understand, Grandma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They exchanged a few more words before he ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon resumed tapping the steering wheel with his fingers, this time slower, more distracted. He stared through the windshield toward the courthouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenched his jaw. Then, he opened the messaging app on his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thumb hovered over a familiar profile picture-a simple floral image, tagged &#34;My Love.&#34; He skipped past it and opened the thread with Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last message he&#39;d sent her simply reminded herof the time and place to meet for the divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still hadn&#39;t shown up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a scowl, Brandon sent a new message. &#34;Where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the window followed almost instantly. He turned to see Millie standing outside, her face a little pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the door and slipped into the passenger seat,giving him a blank look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t changed out of yesterday&#39;s clothes-the same ones she had picked out for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the years, it had always been her-choosing his ties, picking his cologne, arranging every detail down to the fit of his tailored shirts and suits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you late?&#34; Brandon asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not late,&#34; she said quietly.She was simply no longer the girl who would always arrive early and wait for him without thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s fingers stilled against the wheel. His eyes narrowed slightly as he studied her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked a little pale, maybe from a sleepless night after he mentioned the divorce last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she looked fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My grandma called earlier,&#34; Brandon muttered,looking away. &#34;Don&#39;t tell them about the divorce.They&#39;re too old to handle something like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t respond right away. Instead, she asked,&#34;What did your grandma say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She wants us to have a baby,&#34; Brandon said flatly, a flicker of irritation slipping into his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence settled in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Millie let out a small soft laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon curled his hand into a fist and turned his face to the window.There were moments when he used to imagine what their child might look like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered holding her fromn behind, pressing a hand gently over her belly, whispering, &#34;Millie, when will you give me a baby?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it hadn&#39;t happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyway, they could always remarry in six months and start planning for a baby. There would still be enough time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian, however, only had six months left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, passers-by came and went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Millie spoke up. &#34;Just once more, Brandon.Are you completely sure you want to go through with the divorce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Having second thoughts?&#34; Brandon barked, looking genuinely upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was still waiting for him at the studio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After confirming once more, Millie didn&#39;t say another</p>
                
                
                
                <p>word. She reached into her bag, pulled out a document, and handed it to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took it with a frown, flipping through the pages.It was a property division agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we&#39;re getting divorced,&#34; she said, &#34;we should make everything clear. I&#39;ll only take what I&#39;m entitled to from the Watson family. And from this moment on,anything either of us earns belongs to us individually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Millie pulled out a pen and placed it beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that&#39;s okay with you, just sign it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s eyes stayed on the document, but his frown deepened as he read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The agreement was too simple. She really wasn&#39;t asking for much. And her signature was already there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t get it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was she trying to do? It was basically just afake divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian only had six months left. He planned to spend those months by her side. After that, he&#39;d return to Millie-no one else needed to know the divorce ever happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, Millie had always seemed blindly loyal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon had never thought of her as someone with pride or boundaries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time he&#39;d grown bored of her, pushing her into things that chipped away at her pride on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie never declined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d still return with a soft smile, holding out the results like a trophy. &#34;Brandon, look-I did it. Isn&#39;t it great?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a good wife. Meek. Obedient. For seven years, he&#39;d seen it play out over and over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t for Vivian, their marriage probably wouldhave gone on like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of memory-Vivian, weak and coughing blood, still trying to smile-stabbed at his chest. The pain was raw and unshakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon looked outside the car window again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s reflection stared back at him-blank,expressionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this her way of threatening him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, she had once faked messages to frame Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hated Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chuckling dryly, Brandon picked up the pen and signed his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one could force his hand. Not even her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were two copies of the agreement.Millie calmly took her copy after he signed both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both stepped out of the car and headed into the courthouse. Together, they filed for divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next time they came back here, they would finalize everything and collect the official decree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once all the formalities were done, the two of them stepped out of the courthouse together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun was already blazing, and the warmth settled on Millie&#39;s skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon scanned the people moving about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t hard to tell the couples getting married from those getting divorced. Some people chose to have their weddings at the courthouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple walked by, hand in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman&#39;s smile triggered something in Brandon.He remembered that same look on Millie&#39;s face a year ago, when they first got married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon glanced over at Millie, but her face was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll keep transferring money to your account during the next six months,&#34; he said. &#34;And don&#39;t say anything to my grandparents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t wait for a reply. Just turned and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stood there quietly, watching his car disappear around the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cab arrived not long after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, the two cars went opposite directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One turned toward Vivian Floral Design.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other headed for Crobert Hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon walked into Vivian&#39;s studio, where she greeted him with a gentle smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He told her, &#34;It&#39;s done. She didn&#39;t make a scene.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Millie stepped into the ob-gyn wing and quietly sat opposite the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor reached over and pulled the curtain.&#34;Millie... are you sure you want to terminate the pregnancy?&#34; Her best friend and doctor, Alexia Hussain, looked at her with concern. &#34;You were so determined to have a baby. You even worked so hard to get yourself ready for conception...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie reached into her bag and placed the divorce filing receipt on the side table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; she replied calmly. &#34;Let&#39;s terminate it. I don&#39;t、want it anymore.&#34;</p>
