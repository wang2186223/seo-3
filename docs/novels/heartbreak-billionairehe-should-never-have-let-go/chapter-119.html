                <p>Hearing those words was the only thing that finally quieted the unrest inside Brandon&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped out of the prison and let the city swallow him,wandering aimlessly for hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His footsteps eventually led him to a street outside a kindergarten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t leave his car-he simply sat there,watching from afar as children tumbled and laughed on the playground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the midst of the noise, Ari sat at a small table,head bowed as she sketched beside her friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her, Brandon felt an unfamiliar calm unfurl quietly inside him, soothing the ache he&#39;d been carrying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Millie was seated with a designer, her expression hidden behind a medical mask as they discussed costume details for the Heavenly Melody finals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone buzzed, slicing through the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I need to take this,&#34; Millie remarked, rising and slipping out into the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the screen-Brandon&#39;s name flashed across it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart tightened instantly, every nerve on edge as she hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stared at her phone in disbelief. The official decree would be finalized tomorrow-so why was Brandon calling now, of all times?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he... changed his mind? What would she do if he had?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions chased each other through her head as the phone rang on and on, refusing to let her breathe</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the last possible second, she finaly picked up and slipped quietly into the quiet far end of the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; she demanded in a flat tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s voice reached her, gentle and unexpectedly intimate. &#34;Let&#39;s have dinner tonight. Bring Ari. I&#39;ve already made the reservation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crease appeared between Millie&#39;s brows. Her first instinct was to refuse, but she paused. With so little time left, she had no energy for another scene. So she simply asked, &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered softly, his words wrapped in a familiar warmth, &#34;Millie, the decree comes through tomorrow.After that, we might not have the chance to sit down like this again for a long time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s gaze drifted up to a sleek modern painting on the wall as she struggled to steady her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this dinner meant to mark the end of them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertainty twisted in her chest while she hesitated in the hush of the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon lingered in silence, the weight of his words hanging between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, he murmured, &#34;Just this once. After tonight and until we remarry-unless there&#39;s an emergency-I won&#39;t contact you or Ari again.&#34; 1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing her lips into a thin line, she responded, &#34;You&#39;d better mean it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no plans to go back to him. If he truly kept his promise, then tonight would mark a clean,final break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely,&#34; Brandon replied, his voice so soft it barely carried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sent her the restaurant details, and then ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon let his phone falI to the passenger seat and gazed out the window at the kindergarten gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no idea what he was hoping for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a few months, Vivian would be gone. That was the plan-and after that, he and Millie would remarry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But right now, he needed something-some reason,some grit-to pull him through the days ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked over at Ari, still sitting on the playground,surrounded by her friends, lost in her painting. Her laughter floated across the yard, bright and unburdened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon found himself smiling, warmth blooming quietly in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s brows knitted tighter as she mulled everything over, doubt gnawing at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some thought, she dialed Alexia and ran through the details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia, sprawled out on her sofa with an apple slice in hand,sounded unimpressed. &#34;Who knows what game he&#39;s playing now? As long as he actually puts his name on the divorce papers tomorrow, that&#39;s all we need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie let out a faint sigh, conceding the point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia went on, her tone sharpening, &#34;What worries me is that he invited you hoping you&#39;ll change your mind. If that&#39;s his angle, it&#39;ll just make everything messier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie couldn&#39;t help but laugh dryly.&#34;Change my mind?Me? Not a chance. Vivian&#39;s still waiting for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia shrugged,switching the fruit for the TV remote.&#34;Honestly, the chances of that are pretty slim. But if he tries to pull anything, just shut him down. Don&#39;t even give him room to maneuver. And if he refuses to sign, you&#39;ve got your backup-you can drag him to court. Things will settle, one way or another.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie listened, her tension slowly easing as Alexia&#39;s confidence rubbed off on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she was overthinking it, but the persistent suspicion about Brandon&#39;s true motives lingered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Men really do love to get self-pitied, huh? And let&#39;s be honest-he&#39;s probably just trying to keep you on a short leash, especially if he&#39;s hoping to remarry you once Vivian&#39;s gone,&#34; Alexia noted, rolling her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave a weary nod as she replied, &#34;Yeah. That part&#39;s true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia suddenly straightened, her tone sharp with concern. &#34;Wait-don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re actually considering getting back together with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely not!&#34; Millie shot back, her gaze drifting to the painting on the wall. &#34;My heart shattered in that hospital stairwell. There&#39;s no fixing that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia exhaled, regret flickering across her face.&#34;Sorry. I shouldn&#39;t have brought it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie managed a small, steady smile. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. I have Ari now. That&#39;s what matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. Just play along tonight. If you push back,he might make things messy tomorrow,&#34; Alexia warned,voice low and serious. &#34;I&#39;ll have Giffard hang around nearby. If anything feels off, call him right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie agreed with a simple, &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, she glanced at the time-still a little while before she needed to leave. She turned her attention back to the designer, diving back into the finer points of the performance costumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each piece was elaborate, demanding painstaking attention to every last detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really appreciate you pulling this off,&#34; Millie said as they wrapped up. &#34;I&#39;m relying on you more than ever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The designer&#39;s grin was easy. &#34;No worries-l&#39;ve got you covered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d teamed up four times now, and each project had only made their partnership stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their creative chemistry just clicked-every collaboration seemed to spark something new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few more minutes of light conversation, Millie glanced at her watch, excused herself, and headed off to change clothes. Then she grabbed her keys and drove to Ari&#39;s school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Millie walked inside, Ari was already waiting,perched on a bench by the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie!&#34; Ari&#39;s eyes lit up and she hurried over for a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here, you.&#34; Millie crouched to her level, arms outstretched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squeezed Ari gently, and then leaned back to study her face. &#34;Sweetheart, I need your opinion on something,&#34; she said, her voice low and warm.&#34;Brandon asked if we&#39;d join him for a farewell dinner tonight. Would you like to go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie meant it-if Ari even hesitated, she&#39;d call Brandon and decline without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari tipped her head, thinking it over. &#34;What about you?&#34;she countered, her tone neither eager nor resistant,simply curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie met Ari&#39;s gaze, her expression softening. &#34;You get to decide, sweetheart. If you&#39;d rather not go,we&#39;ll skip it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari&#39;s lips curled into a sly little grin. &#34;Did he say something to you?&#34; she teased, eyes bright with curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie couldn&#39;t help but laugh-she&#39;d never seen that spark in Ari before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He did,&#34; she admitted, and then explained Brandon&#39;s promise: no more contact unless it was absolutely necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari nodded as the situation clicked into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, let&#39;s go,&#34; she remarked with an easy smile.&#34;We&#39;ll just pretend it&#39;s dinner at the neighbor&#39;s house or something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really are the best,&#34; Millie murmured, pressing a kiss to Ari&#39;s forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari giggled and reached up, planting a playful kiss on Millie&#39;s cheek in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They lingered in that warm, affectionate moment-until a sudden shadow stretched across them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, they both looked up. Brandon stood there,silent, his presence dimming their smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw the change in their faces and felt a pang of regret, but managed a gentle greeting.&#34;Hey, Ari.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari took a moment to think, and then greeted him with a quiet,&#34;Hello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave her a subtle nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening his posture, he turned to Millie. &#34;Ready to go?&#34; he inquired</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Millie squeezed Ari&#39;s hand and led her toward the parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you both ride with me?&#34; Brandon offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie fixed him with an icy stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of Ari&#39;s last car ride with Brandon-how frightened she&#39;d been when he started yelling-was still fresh in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not happening,&#34; Millie declared, her voice steely. &#34;Ari isn&#39;t gettingin your car ever again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon faltered, visibly caught off guard, but after a beat,he only nodded and kept his thoughts to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They drove separately, Millie&#39;s protective grip never loosening from Ari&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun was dipping low when they reached Crobert&#39;s renowned seaside restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Millie and Ari stepped out of their car, Brandon joined them on the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, the three of them walked inside, arriving just as the mellow chimes of the grand foyer clock marked five o&#39;clock.</p>
