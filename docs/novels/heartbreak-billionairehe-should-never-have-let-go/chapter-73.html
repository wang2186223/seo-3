                <p>Brandon&#39;s lips trailed lower, lingering at the small mole just above Millie&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice broke through the haze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pretended not to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you really force me?&#34; Millie&#39;s hands pressed against his head, her tone pleading and defiant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated, desire warring with restraint, but his arms refused to let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our loss in Flesta was a tragedy,Millie,&#34; he murmured,heat and longing sharpening his words. &#34;We could try again...we could have another child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter laugh, soaked in heartbreak, escaped her. &#34;If that&#39;s what you want, go to Vivian instead. Isn&#39;t she the one you spend every waking moment with these days? Haven&#39;t you already slept with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice broke, trembling with grief. &#34;Brandon, don&#39;t do this to me. It makes me sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sobs wracked her, each breath shaking her small frame with fresh waves of pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hovered on Brandon&#39;s lips-he wanted to tell her nothing had ever happened with Vivian,that she was wrong about all of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie&#39;s mind was made up, and anything he said now would only sound like excuses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Defeated, he let the silence grow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brows knitted in frustration, he finally pulled himself upright,unwilling to add to her misery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lingered on her, rumpled and broken on the sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat still pulsed beneath his skin, but with effort,he drew his hands away, forcing himself toturn from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A muscle worked in his jaw as he pressed his eyes shut,wrestling his own desire into submission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pale moonlight spilled across the floor, illuminating every quiet detail in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He listened as her sobs slowly faded, powerless to comfort either her or himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A movement caught his attention-Millie straightened,gathering herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly buttoned up her shirt, swiped the tears from her cheeks, and pulled her pants into place.Several buttons had vanished-torn away by his impatience, now nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get you a new shirt,&#34; Brandon said quietly, his gaze settling on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips were flushed and swollen, still bearing traces of where his mouth had lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desire, only moments ago pushed aside, now threatened to break loose again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fingers curled into tight fists as he fought for control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to look at him, she slid off the bed,eyes fixed on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw her intent clear as day-she was determined to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really have to go?&#34; Brandon asked, voice tight, working to keep his temper in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Millie rose, though her legs were unsteady beneath her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritated, Brandon reached for her, pulling her back down to the mattress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma expects us to remain here tonight,&#34; he said, his tone edged with warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s reply came out cold. &#34;I have no intention of staying. Try to force me,Brandon, and you&#39;ll only earn my hatred.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration churned inside him, his jaw tight and his body tense with restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started to rise once more,and Brandon was ready to snap, but the sudden buzz of his phone cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s name flashed across the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint crease appeared on Brandon&#39;s brow. He paused,debating, but finally accepted the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s voice came through, strained and uncertain.&#34;Brandon, I heard you went back to Moonlit Estate tonight-with Millie.Is that true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he answered, voice flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With news of his return spreading through the family,it was no wonder Vivian had somehow caught wind of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you with her right now?&#34; Vivian asked, her words trembling, barely holding back tears. &#34;Are you...spending the night there together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon found himself without a ready answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were meant to share the night under the same roof. But Millie had refused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was a detail Vivian didn&#39;t need to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His silence stretched between them, and Vivian&#39;s quiet sniffles gave way to soft sobbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still said nothing, lost for words and unwilling to offer empty reassurances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a spell, Vivian&#39;s sobs turned into a harsh cough.&#34;Ahem... ahem...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could hear her struggling for breath, her voice cracking through the phone. &#34;Brandon, I feel awful...lt hurts so much tonight...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mid-conversation, Brandon&#39;s phone buzzed again. He glanced down to see a message from Vivian-a photo flashed on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was streaked with tears, lips wiped raw, and a faint line of blood lingered at the corner of her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image told the rest-her coughing had left its mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s voice trembled through the line. &#34;Brandon,please...could you come over? I&#39;m in so much pain</p>
                
                
                
                <p>right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep frown furrowed Brandon&#39;s brow, his eyes shutting for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave in,replying quietly, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stood nearby, having seen and heard everything.Brandon made no effort to hide the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s plea hung between them-Millie knew exactly what it meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you going to her?&#34; Millie&#39;s voice was flat. &#34;It&#39;s obvious you want to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot her a look,lips drawn tight and eyes hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thousand explanations crowded his mind-he wanted to say it was only because Vivian was sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the coldness in Millie&#39;s gaze stopped him, and every word withered before it could reach his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rose from the bed. Once dressed in fresh clothes,he grabbed his keys from the dresser. Without making a sound, he slipped out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the entryway, his gaze lingered on the closed door to the bedroom. He looked away and left the villa without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie waited untiI she heard Brandon leave before she let out a deep sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scrambling to her feet, she locked the door in a hurry.She even dragged a table against it for extra security,and then sank to the floor, drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s presence still clung to her as she clutched at her collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything he said made sense. There was no way she could make it home tonight, not with her head spinning from too much wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their marriage still stood on paper, with memories of nights spent together and heartbreak from the babies they lost before birth, but Vivian was his world now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy wave of emotion drove him out of the house,chasing after Vivian, while Millie knew what would happen next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as she understood, her heart wanted none of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had let him go a long time ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon settled behind the wheel of his car. As he buckled in, he spotted Matthew, the butler, hurrying</p>
                
                
                
                <p>toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Watson, where are you headed?&#34; Matthew called,worry in his voice. &#34;Your grandmother gave strict orders that both you and Mrs. Watson stay at the estate tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon hesitated for a moment before rolling the window down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the glow from the porch lights, the lines on Matthew&#39;s face seemed even deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s something I need to take care of tonight,&#34;said Brandon, voice steady. &#34;I&#39;ll make sure I&#39;m here for breakfast with Grandpa and Grandma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry flickered in Matthew&#39;s eyes as he continued,&#34;Sir, this isn&#39;t only about sharing a meal. Your grandparents hopes you and Mrs. Watson can mend things while you&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of reconciliation hung in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A memory of Millie&#39;s tear-stained face flickered through Brandon&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking down,he avoided Matthew&#39;s gaze and stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matthew pleaded, &#34;Sir, I can&#39;t let you go. Your grandmother is counting on me to bring you both</p>
                
                
                
                <p>together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without meeting his eyes, Brandon said, &#34;There&#39;s no need for Grandma to know the details.&#34; He then started the engine. &#34;I&#39;ll return by morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon guided the car away from the house, careful to steer around Matthew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation laced Matthew&#39;s voice as he shouted, &#34;Mr.Watson,please! Mr.Watson!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon caught a glimpse of him in the rearview mirror but kept driving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>City lights blurred past as the Bentley cut through the dark, Brandon&#39;s gaze never wavering from the road ahead. Sorting through his feelings proved impossible,leaving only a storm raging inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion reigned over his thoughts. Even his heartbeat felt unsettled and uneven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding a solution to this tangled web of emotions seemed beyond him; he tackled only what little he could manage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such uncertainty was foreign territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every deal he handled at work showcased his confidence and calculated moves, yet tonight he felt lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bit by bit, control kept slipping through his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear crept in with that realization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow breath brought him back to the present,and he tried to block out the chaos for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s health demanded his attention, and he knew he had to be by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, he reached her apartment building,found a spot to park, and rode the elevator to her floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment at her door, he pressed the bell.Vivian answered,appearing before him in the doorway.</p>
