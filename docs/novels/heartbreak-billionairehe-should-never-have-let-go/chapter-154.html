                <p>Once the speculation began, everyone suddenly realized something wasn&#39;t quite right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, that&#39;s right. Millie is Brandon&#39;s wife. So at that auction... what was Vivian doing there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From what I heard, Vivian wasn&#39;t even on the guest list. She went wvith Brandon as his date.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember that going viral. Brandon rarely attends those social events, and when he does, it&#39;s always with Millie. But that time, it was Vivian. And people simply couldn&#39;t stop talking about it. Yeah, she definitely went as Brandon&#39;s plus-one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about Serena? Did she go with Charles, or was she there on her own?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s where it gets interesting. Apparently, Serena had her own bidding number, which only came with an invitation card. When the donation fraud accusations surfaced, it was mentioned that there were no records under her name and number. So yes, Serena was invited independently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The speculation sparked a wave of renewed interest online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People began rewatching old clips, reanalyzing reports.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something&#39;s off. Vivian didn&#39;t just tag along, she basically wore a bridal gown. What was that supposed to mean? Was she trying to send a message?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dress, with its unmistakable bridal silhouette, had indeed been the center of attention that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t Vivian once say she&#39;d never be the other woman? What does this dress say, then? Millie is Brandon&#39;s legal wife and she&#39;s still in the picture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The narrative online shifted. Millie, once condemned for tolerating her husband&#39;s affairs in exchange for a luxurious life, was now seen in a different light. The criticism turned toward Vivian-for knowingly staying close to Brandon despite his marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t we live-streaming? Vivian, answer us! Weren&#39;t you just sketching your own funeral invitation card?That means you&#39;re watching. Say something!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment exploded in popularity, piling intense pressure on Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was no longer visible on the stream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously caught on hidden camera, she now dared not speak freely backstage</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat inside her car, accompanied only by her caregiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Simpson, what should we do now?&#34; The caregiver&#39;s voice trembled. &#34;There&#39;s no way to explain this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would&#39;ve guessed Serena was Millie? Everything&#39;s falling apart...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s face contorted with frustration. She shot the caregiver a harsh look, silencing her instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the recording studio, contestants eliminated from previous rounds were being brought onstage again as guest performers. Their voices drifted faintly in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian pulled out her phone and called Johnny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up right away, clearly in a panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Simpson, what now?&#34; Johnny&#39;s voice cracked. They might have a bunch of backup plans, but none of them accounted for Serena being Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had assumed Serena was finished and had been preparing to exploit the situation, stoking public anger against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, they were out of moves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s still time,&#34; Vivian said, forcing herself to stay composed. &#34;As long as the livestream&#39;s running, I can claim I haven&#39;t seen the online backlash yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But things are moving fast. Millie&#39;s team already has professionals pushing the fact that you didn&#39;t spend a dime at the charity auction,&#34; Johnny warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian closed her eyes, her mind racing. Then, slowly, she turned to glance at Brandon&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere backstage, Brandon stood near Millie&#39;s lounge, waiting for her to come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to speak to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts circled back to everything he&#39;d learned about Serena lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon&#39;s words echoed-&#34;Serena&#39;s condition on the earlier broadcasts? Anyone with eyes could telt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it was true. Brandon had seen it. He&#39;d even blamed Charles for letting her work despite those obvious injuries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,looking back...he understood the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>HHe remembered what happened a few days ago at Crobert Hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That morning, he had recovered and was being discharged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While his assistant handled the paperwork, he thought back to Giffard&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He decided to check on Millie&#39;s records.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went to the nurses&#39; station and asked to see her medical file.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And your relationship to her?&#34; the nurse asked, typing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He almost said he was her husband before he remembered they were about to divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m a friend,&#34; he said instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse gave him a pointed look. &#34;A friend? She was hospitalized for days, and you didn&#39;t visit? Can&#39;t you ask her yourself? If you&#39;re not her family, I can&#39;t share patient information.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,thinking back... Brandon closed his eyes, his emotions in turmoil. Everything was unraveling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why had Millie hidden that she was Serena?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her recent behavior and her growing distance all pointed to something deeper, something shifting between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he couldn&#39;t make sense of it. And worse, he couldn&#39;t fix it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dull ache settled in his chest, leaving him lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a call from his grandfather, Derek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he hesitated, debating whether to pick up, he noticed Vivian nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon,&#34; she called softly, her voice shaky, eyes red and filled with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What should I do?&#34; she cried, the tears falling freely now. &#34;I didn&#39;t know Serena was her.I keep thinking about those past episodes.I feel so guilty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sobbed harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know I never meant to hurt her. But now... Brandon, tell me... what can I do to make things right?&#34;⑦</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her, uncertain how to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone buzzed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s eyes followed the vibration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at the phone, she kept crying. &#34;Are you going to choose her over me? Brandon, are you really going to leave me behind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in Millie&#39;s lounge, Millie opened a link popped up in their group chat that showed a new narrative circulating online right now.</p>
