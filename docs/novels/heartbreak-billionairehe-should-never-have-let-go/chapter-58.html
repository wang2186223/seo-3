                <p>Jayceon finally gave a slow nod,realization settling across his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him, the other man hadn&#39;t said a word the entire time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each second dragged by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While online debates grew more intense, several things began unfolding at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the charity gala, Alexia had asked Giffard to find an IT expert to help them restore the cellphone data. So far, there hadn&#39;t been any progress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Seville had managed to obtain footage from the Heavenly Melody live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But because the recording had been done in secret-with the phone stashed under a seat-none of the stage activity was visible. The surrounding conversations were captured too, rendering the clip noisy and difficult to make sense of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Running out of options, Seville turned to his older brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He handed over the file. &#34;Hey, think you can help me with this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man in black-rimmed glasses turned to face his brother. &#34;What kind of help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need the background noise removed. Just leave the singing intact.&#34; Seville tapped the screen to play the video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After listening for a moment, the man adjusted his glasses. &#34;I write code. That&#39;s it. I&#39;m not a wizard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville let out a laugh. &#34;Oh, come on. You&#39;re one of the best data specialists in the country.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man let out a slow breath. &#34;Only when it involves numbers. Fine, leave it here. I&#39;ll try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Appreciate it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Seville wasn&#39;t relying on just that. He came up with not one, but three plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audio hadn&#39;t captured anyone&#39;s face, after all.Even if his brother worked magic, there was no way to extract a clear identity from nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,he decided he&#39;d attend the event again. This time,his setup would be better concealed, and he&#39;d record everything without being noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While waiting to hear back from his brother,Seville scoured the Internet for other recordings from the event. An original video of the Serena&#39;s performance would still be the strongest piece of evidence to back his claims.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In another part of the city, inside a cramped room,a handful of people sat huddled around screens, their attention fixed on the flood of online posts about Vivian and the charity gala.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They replayed multiple leaked clips from devices secretly planned on the show Heavenly Melody&#39;s backstage, picking through the chaos and drawing their own conclusions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First, it seemed Serena had recently miscarried, a shocking detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Second, Vivian and Serena apparently shared a mutual enemy. The audio was messy, but someone seemed to mention Millie. Could it really be her?What had gone wrong between Millie and Serena?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Third, Vivian appeared to be blackmailing Serena,but what was the reason?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group exchanged thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what&#39;s our next move?&#34; one of them asked.&#34;Clips like these could sell for a fortune.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another reached over and knocked him lightly on the head. &#34;Think bigger. Vivian&#39;s public image is all sunshine and grace, but these clips tell a different story. We don&#39;t know her motives, but it&#39;s clear she wants to keep this quiet. The more we gather,the more power we&#39;ll have when it&#39;s time to negotiate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their leader drummed his fingers on the table. &#34;And don&#39;t forget Serena. She plays everything close to the chest. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she&#39;s hiding something major.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned forward. &#34;For now, we keep everything under wraps. You saw what happened during the live stream, someone tried to challenge Vivian and got shut down instantly. We&#39;ll wait, stay low, and make it count when we strike. Otherwise, we risk getting caught in the fallout.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He added, &#34;Keep tabs on Millie too. She&#39;s married to Brandon. That might give us something useful to start with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,boss!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere else in the city, a man stormed out of his temporary lodging for the past few days, his frustration barely contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have no right to do this!&#34; he yelled. &#34;Vivian&#39;s rivals must&#39;ve paid you off!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was one of Vivian&#39;s most loyal supporters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He admired her deeply and never missed the opportunity to speak of her brilliance to anyone who&#39;d listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when Vivian ignored a question about the demo, he happened to know some people and took it upon himself to raise the topic during the live broadcast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was still time left before the stream ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online discussions about the demo were heating up.&#34;Yesterday&#34; was gaining momentum back then and beginning to rival &#34;Glimmer of Love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to him, Vivian&#39;s song was unmatched. He believed in her completely and wanted &#34;Glimmer of Love&#34; to dominate the spotlight. If he could get her to speak on the record-just one confirmation about the demo -it would spark even more attention and push her song to the top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never got the chance. Someone must&#39;ve figured out what he was up to, because he was quietly pulled out of his own home and taken to another place before he could say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll see!&#34; he snapped as he stormed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t backing down. One missed opportunity wasn&#39;t going to stop him. He&#39;d find another way to support Vivian and raise the demo&#39;s profile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the police station, Lynda stood at the center of a tense investigation into Millie&#39;s car crash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A colleague walked in holding a folder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lynda, new update. You&#39;ll want to see this.&#34; The colleague passed her a file tied to the charity gala.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lynda&#39;s expression tightened as she flipped through the pages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her expression, the colleague added, &#34;These two are acting strangely. Brandon and Millie might have filed for divorce, but it&#39;s not finalized yet. And now these two keep pushing her, don&#39;t they realize Millie could easily call off the whole thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that was exactly the issue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before everything was finalized, either person could withdraw and halt the proceedings at any moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were Brandon and Vivian not concerned that Millie might change her mind out of nowhere? Or perhaps they were, and they already had plans to ensure she wouldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lynda sat quietly, and then lowered her eyes to the list of strategies noted in her planner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she tapped one of them. &#34;This one,&#34;she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her colleague gave a firm nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time moved on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dropping Vivian off, Brandon headed back to the apartment adjacent to his company building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he walked through the door,he spotted Eugene waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon paused, slightly surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene greeted him with an easy smile. &#34;Mr. Watson,I&#39;ve replaced all the items that were missing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That explained it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As head of the secretariat, Eugene oversaw two branches-one for company operations, the other for Brandon&#39;s private affairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie used to manage both aspects, juggling his schedule and personal life without issue. But with the tension between them lately, Eugene had stepped in to handle things temporarily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave a brief nod and glanced around the apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His suits were back in the closet, neatly arranged alongside his ties, watches, and shoes. Socks and other essentials had been sorted and placed just the way he liked them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The household staff worked quietly in the background,putting everything in order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was efficient. Familiar. Exactly how it should be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Brandon said before heading into the shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he came out, the apartment was empty again. Eugene and the staff had already left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing alone in the living room, Brandon suddenly noticed just how still everything felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no one waiting on the couch, flipping through a book. No voice calling his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No warmth in the quiet. The space felt hollow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for his phone and tapped back into Millie&#39;s chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, he wondered if something was wrong with the phone.</p>
