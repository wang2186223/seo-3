                <p>Brandon remained silent, his face betraying a maze of conflicted emotions as he studied Millie&#39;s features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll come find you in five months,&#34; he declared with quiet determination.0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie offered no concrete response to his promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just go,&#34; she said, taking charge as she began her descent down the courthouse steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon remained frozen on the steps, his gaze following Millie&#39;s retreating figure. He watched as the morning sunlight painted her silhouette in wvarm,golden hues, and without warning, an inexplicable wave of melancholy washed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone buzzed in his pocket at that precise moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He retrieved the device and discovered Vivian&#39;s name illuminating the caller display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His other hand clutched the freshly signed divorce decree that legally severed his bond with Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he lifted his eyes again, Millie had already vanished around the corner, swallowed by the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave his head a sharp shake, attempting to banish the peculiar emotions that threatened to overwhelm his rational thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie harbored deep feelings for himn. She would never abandon their connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, Vivian&#39;s remaining time stretched only five months into the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wait wouldn&#39;t stretch on indefinitely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With these reassuring thoughts anchoring his resolve, Brandon accepted Vivian&#39;s incoming call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon.&#34; Vivian&#39;s familiar voice drifted through the speaker. &#34;Did everything proceed according to plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s eyes dropped to the document resting in his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he responded with measured certainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Millie settled into her vehicle&#39;s driver seat and allowed herself a moment of quiet reflection.She extracted her copy of divorce decree from her purse,captured a clear photograph, and shared the image within her close-knit group chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers typed swiftly. &#34;Successfully obtained the divorce decree.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enthusiastic congratulations flooded her screen almost instantaneously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia responded immediately, &#34;That&#39;s absolutely wonderful! Good riddance to him! He&#39;s nothing but a complete scoundrel!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles contributed his thoughts. &#34;Millie, you&#39;re absolutely incredible! You finally freed yourself from that foolish Brandon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville chimed in with enthusiasm. &#34;This is fantastic!Congratulations to you, Millie, for embracing a brand new</p>
