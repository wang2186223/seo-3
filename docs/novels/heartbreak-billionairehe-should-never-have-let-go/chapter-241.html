                <p>Brandon pressed send.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike before when his messages disappeared without a reply, something happened immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hadn&#39;t gone through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at it in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Millie blocked him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could hardly believe it. Even after they separated,he had always been able to reach her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had assumed that as long as he controlled the Bennett family&#39;s assets, she would hesitate. She would have to contact him eventually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had she blocked him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for the car door, ready to go upstairs and find her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Brandon opened it, he froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far away, Myron&#39;s men stood watching.When they caught his eye, they smiled and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the rooftop garden, Myron finally/eased his hold on Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rested his forehead against hers, closing his eyes as if to steady himself. A brief swallow betrayed thoughts he kept to himself. He bit her lower lip lightly, and then smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie blushed and gave him a sharp look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ari is still here,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t see anything,&#34; Ari replied. &#34;I&#39;m playing with Orange.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie grew more flustered and pushed at Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled and then let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went straight to the swing where Ari sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari hugged Orange while feeding it freeze-dried treats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her short legs dangled above the ground. She had been there for a while. When she saw Millie, she called out, &#34;Push the swing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded and gave it a gentle push.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Orange snuggled closer to Ari. Sensing no danger,it peeked out again to steal another treat, making Ari giggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie couldn&#39;t help but smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Greedy Orange,&#34; she teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari nodded, agreeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie glanced at her handbag. She thought of showing Ari the trinket hanging from it, though she wasn&#39;t sure Ari would understand its meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could decide, a large hand appeared with a small cat ornament.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here,&#34; Myron said, handing it to Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The little girl&#39;s eyes lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, it&#39;s Orange!&#34; She compared the ornament with the real cat in her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I picked it up from the company earlier,&#34; Myron said.&#34;| thought you&#39;d like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie continued to push the swing, finding herself more and more fond of Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron stood beside them, watching. He felt a rare and quiet contentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out to steady the swing and gave it a gentle push. &#34;The paperwork has been approved,&#34; he told Ari. &#34;The adoption procedures will be done in about a week. Ari, how about you and Millie move in with me then? We have koi in the pond, Kiki at home,drivers, a nice housekeeper, and a family doctor. It will be easier for us to take care of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari&#39;s face lit up, but she looked to Millie before answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari grinned, showing her small teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Can I bring Orange to play with Kiki?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; Myron said, reaching out to stroke Orange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie watched them and felt her heart warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was simple happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fireworks still burst overhead, filling the night for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The show would be remembered by many for a very long time, no doubt about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People began guessing its purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, word spread that it had been arranged by the Elliott family-more specifically, Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Myron&#39;s successful proposal made the news,the connection was obovious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myron is trying to outdo Brandon. When Brandon married Millie, he set off fireworks. Now Myron wants an even bigger show.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love it. Let them keep competing. I want more fireworks and more free shows.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you daydreaming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care about them. I want to know why Vivian hasn&#39;t responded yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, it&#39;s basically confirmed she entered Brandon and Millie&#39;s old home without permission and live-streamed it. She used to be loud online. Now she&#39;s silent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The debate online continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some discussed Myron and Brandon competition while others called for Vivian to apoologize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the fireworks ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drones flew off, and Myron drove Millie and Ari home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they stepped out of the car, Ari took Millie&#39;s hand and led her toward a corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the moment, Myron lingered by the car,pretending to tidy things inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari stopped by a small tree and looked up at Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, is Myron your boyfriend now?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie crouched so their eyes met.&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you get married?&#34; Ari blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know yet,&#34; Millie said with a smile, &#34;but l&#39;ve agreed to his proposal. He&#39;s my fiance now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari tilted her head,puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It means that if everything goes well, we&#39;ll get married,&#34; Millie explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari nodded, and then suddenly hugged her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie held her, unsure at first why Ari was being so</p>
                
                
                
                <p>affectionate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Ari lifted her face. Millie smiled at her adorable little face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had both been abandoned once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari had told her before that her parents left her, but she was lucky to meet Millie. She had said that when Millie left Brandon, she too would find someone better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, we&#39;ll both be happy,&#34; Ari said with a wide smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie smiled and hugged her tightly. &#34;Yes. We&#39;ll both be happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie feIt grateful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything seemed to be falling into place. The new jewelry collection had been a success. She had let go of the past. She was engaged to Myron. Ari&#39;s adoption procedures were almost complete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life was moving forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie slept soundly that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, she had barely gotten out of bed when her phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, come to Watson Group,&#34; Derek said. &#34;There are points in the agreement that need to be discussed and revised. Brandon and Vivian are already here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s heart tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek had always treated her well because she was once Brandon&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she had accepted Myron&#39;s proposal in public.Would that change everything?</p>
