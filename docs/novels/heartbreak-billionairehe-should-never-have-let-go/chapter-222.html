                <p>Chapter&#39;s closed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie took a breath, her smile shining even brighter in the sun&#39;s glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She followed up with, &#34;He&#39;s not mine anymore. Where you go from here, that&#39;s all on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message was clear. &#34;Rummage through the trash I tossed all you want-because I don&#39;t even care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Energy crackled through the crowdas they caught what she meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, an online challenge swept through the chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Join in!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With both streams having disabled tipping, viewers decided to create their own contest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s side exploded with cheers and encouragement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go for it, Millie! If you keep holding yyour ground, we&#39;ll buy the new collection!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s audience wasn&#39;t far behind, spamming their own support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay strong, Vivian! We promised, if you keep it up, we&#39;Il check out Love of Vivian when it hits the cinema!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tensions were hitting their peak as the showdown intensified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As word of the showdown spread, even more people jumped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t leave me out! This is wvild!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Turn up the drama! Things aren&#39;t nearly spicy enough!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian, see if you can sneak a peek at their old bedroom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, don&#39;t let Vivian off easy! I can&#39;t stand how shameless she&#39;s being about wrecking someone&#39;s marriage!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two livestreams surged with loyal fans, each side determined to back their favorite until the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment sections erupted into a virtual brawl, fans on both sides firing shots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News of the escalating drama quickly reached both Millie and Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly smile played on Millie&#39;s lips. What began as a bid for a little extra publicity had suddenly become serious.The outcome here could make or break the new product launch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With fresh determination, Millie walked back to the golden river of sunflowers on display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The framed photograph nestled among the blooms shimmered in the sunlight, though the joy once captured on those faces had vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that remained was resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A firm promise to come out on top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s smile stayed flawless, every inch the poised host.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s keep going, everyone,&#34; Millie announced, ushering the crowd deeper into the venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,excitement flickered in Vivian&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could possibly be so special about Millie&#39;s endless rows of sunflowers?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surely her own stream promised far more excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here she was, a notorious&#34;home-wrecker&#34; broadcasting live from the very place Millie once shared with Brandon, right in front of their old wedding photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian believed nothing Millie put forward could ever compare to the surge of adrenaline she made the audience feel right now!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riding that adrenaline, Vivian made her way into the kitchen. She arranged flowers in a basin, lifting them for her viewers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Monet&#39;s Water Lilies,&#34; Vivian announced brightly. With a playful tilt of her head, she asked, &#34;Where do you think these belong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian acted like she was genuinely interested in what her viewers thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suggestions poured in at lightning speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most fans were pushing for her to place the flowers in what used to be Millie and Brandon&#39;s bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, I&#39;ve decided they&#39;l look best in the bathroom,&#34; Vivian said as she shook her head. Vivian feigned surprise at the chat&#39;s suggestions, pausing dramatically as if she didn&#39;t want to step on Millie&#39;s toes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a decisive nod before she continued,&#34;Let&#39;s take a look at what the bathroom has to offer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her assistant&#39;s voice slipped through the live stream mic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pretty soon, this will be Vivian and Brandon&#39;s bathroom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s assistant probably thought his comment went unnoticed, but eagle-eyed viewers picked up on it instantly, clipped the audio, and made it viral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reaction was instant, with some viewers cheering while others recoiled in disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flurry of debate broke out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was from the assistant, not Vivian!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But isn&#39;t Vivian the shameless one for streaming here in the first place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just a regular broadcast, and it seems like Brandon approved. He and Millie are divorced, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This whole thing is gross, especially when they link it to Millie&#39;s stream! Seriously, I&#39;m about to throw up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Comments flooded in as viewers eagerly joined the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the camera followed Vivian as she stood up and made her way toward the bathroom, tension building with every step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Millie guided her guests into the second showcase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What looked like an ordinary sunflower field from the outside transformed into something magical once you stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A collective gasp swept through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overhead, the ceiling had been painted a mesmerizing shade of deep blue, casting the sunflowers in a new light and making their golden petals seem to glow even brighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blooms appeared to dance in slow motion, as if drifting along a river of gold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike the simple outdoor display, this golden river shimmered with every step. Puffs of golden mist puffed out beneath their feet, giving the illusion of walking on sand-spun from pure gold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious guests knelt down to touch the glittering mist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This feels unreal...Is this actual gold dust?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way! Did they really pour so much into this setup?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As everyone marveled at the spectacle, music began to fill the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eva&#39;s latest single floated through the air, perfectly matched to the enchanting scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The romantic melody, paired with the shimmering sea of flowers, created an atmosphere that felt almost dreamlike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guests soon noticed something new. The sunflowers, carried by the golden current, were now interspersed with vibrant yellow gemstone blossoms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Against the dazzling river, they sparkled like scattered jewels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in Proidan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon had just wrapped up his business and finally able to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Brandon&#39;s phone reconnected, he was hit with a barrage of urgent notifications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brow furrowed as he scrolled through the messages, quickly tapping the live stream link Eugene had sent. On the screen, both chaos and brilliance awaited him.</p>
