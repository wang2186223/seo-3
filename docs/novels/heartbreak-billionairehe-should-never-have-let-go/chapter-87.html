                <p>A hesitant grin flickered across Vivian&#39;s face as she looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just had to do it, Brandon,&#34; she admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Brandon regarded her, lines of concern deepening across his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian explained, &#34;The public already links &#39;Glimmer of Love&#39; to me.If I don&#39;t claim the demo as mine, it puts everything at risk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave no reply, his expression showing only skepticism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying again, she added, &#34;That fan has been showing up for every live broadcast. Go ahead and check if you don&#39;t believe me, Brandon. Even if I shut him out again this round, he&#39;s not going to give up-he&#39;ll get in one way or another. Remember, we bought that song from Eva for a staggering sum. Usually,even a top composer gets only one million, but you handed her ten, Brandon. That covered everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she poured out her reasoning, Brandon kept his gaze locked on her, unmoved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uneasy silence settled in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Vivian exhaled, her shoulders drooping. &#34;Some choices just have to be made, Brandon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely above a whisper, she added, &#34;I don&#39;t have much time left. If I want to achieve anything, this is the only way. Shouldn&#39;t the end justify the means, if what I&#39;m doing is for the greater good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment&#39;s hesitation lingered before Vivian lifted her head, forcing a smile.&#34;Isn&#39;t that Millie&#39;s approach too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon said nothing, lips pressed into a thin line as he regarded Vivian, noticing the redness building in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up as Vivian whispered, &#34;So Millie gets away with it, but I&#39;m not allowed to? Is that what this is, Brandon-do you just favor her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, Brandon shifted his focus to the window, turning away from her completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night had already fallen, and the world outside blurred by, bathed in the weak glow of passing streetlights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the while, Brandon&#39;s mind argued that Millie was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compassion shaped her actions toward others. When Millie was unyielding, it was only with herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden tension gripped his temples, and Brandon realized a headache was brewing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, with only half a year left for Vivian, he could hardly bring himself to judge her choices too harshly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s gaze stayed fixed on his profile, her mind working behind searching eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to come out on top right from the start; it was the only way to show that, even as a newcomer, she could leave the professionals in her shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winning wasn&#39;t just about the trophy for Vivian; her real aim was to outshine Millie completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting Serena take center stage would rob her of any chance to prove herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victory in that opening round became nonnegotiable-Vivian simply had to come out on top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the Bentley cut through traffic while MMillie had already scooped up Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elaborate mermaid makeup had vanished. Now Millie strolled through an aisle of art supplies, Ari&#39;s small hand clasped in hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari&#39;s passion for drawing had been the spark-Millie purchased one of her paintings, and a deep connection blossomed from there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Bennett, do you think I could have these?&#34; asked Ari, pointing shyly to a bundle of new paintbrushes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie crouched down to meet her gaze, brushing a stray strand from Ari&#39;s forehead.&#34;Ari,you never need to be shy with me. Whatever your heart wants, I&#39;ll make sure you have it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari&#39;s eyes sparkled with happiness, savoring the reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, she stayed mindful, selecting only the art tools she truly needed, not wanting to be wasteful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing this gentle restraint, Millie felt her fondness for Ari grow even deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind Ari&#39;s cheerful exterior, there was a challenge-she had VSD, a congenital heart defect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeking answers, Millie had taken Ari to visit Alexia, where she learned that it wasn&#39;t fatal, and with surgery and diligent care, Ari could live a healthy life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite this, Ari&#39;s parents had given up on her, leaving scars of insecurity and a fear of being unwanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what happened, Millie would treat Ari as though she were her own daughter, determined to help her rise above any obstacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the bill settled, Millie kept a gentle grip on Ari&#39;s hand as they stepped into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A leisurely walk followed, Ari bursting into laughter as she recounted amusing tales from her days at kindergarten, their sharedjoy echoing down the block.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a Bentley sped past them, its polished body glinting under the city lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hidden behind the tinted glass, Brandon couldn&#39;t help but notice the easy happiness on Milie&#39;s and Ari&#39;s faces, an unexpected warmth stirring inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Millie found herself at the entrance of the private room Charles had booked for their gathering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Seville,Alexia, and Sheridan had already arrived, waiting while Charles was still on the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened and Millie entered with Ari nestled in her arms, promnpting Alexia to cross the room with a bright smnile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look who it is-Ari!&#34; Alexia beamed, presenting a gift. &#34;You remember me, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sweet voice, Ari replied, &#34;Alexia,&#34; though she hesitated before accepting the present, her eyes flicking to Millie for approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave a reassuring nod, and Ari&#39;s face lit up as she hugged the big-eared dog plushie close.&#34;Thank you, Alexia,&#34; she said,joy sparkling in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to resist, Alexia reached out and gently pinched Ari&#39;s cheek, adoration plain on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft, affectionate smile brightened Millie&#39;s face as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chairs slid back and everyone found their places around the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they waited for Charles to arrive, Alexia leaned in and said, &#34;I&#39;ve already spoken with a few doctors. The sooner we start Ari&#39;stests, the better. Once everything&#39;s filed, we&#39;ll be ready to schedule her surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Ari&#39;s adoption procedures weren&#39;t yet done completely, Millie had to wait until she could sign Ari&#39;s surgery consent form as a legal guardian. Still, they could start getting ready for that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie acknowledged the update, her voice sincere. &#34;Thank you, Alexia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waving it off, Alexia replied with an easy grin,&#34;Don&#39;t mention it. I&#39;ll make sure Giffard takes the lead on the surgery. His skills are second to none.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Ari, she added a gentle reassurance. &#34;There&#39;s nothing to worry about, sweetheart. Once this is over, you&#39;ll be running and playing like every other kid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the thought of surgery made Ari a little uneasy, she gave a brave nod, resolve shining in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how dauntig it seemed, she would face whatever pain came her way-she wanted nothing more than to belong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to resist, Millie wrapped Ari in another hug, her own heart swelling with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Charles breezed in with a cheerful, &#34;I&#39;m here!&#34; and gave a nod to the wait staff to start serving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t come empty-handed either; another thoughtful gift found its way to Ari&#39;s side. The little girl had truly won everyone over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joy and warmth filled the room, turning their gathering into something truly special.</p>
