                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Mr. Watson. I couldn&#39;t keep him still,&#34; said the caregiver, her voice edged with worry as she glanced at Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick, dismissive wave, Brandon motioned for her to step back and carefully rolled Derek over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll handle it,&#34; said Brandon, gently taking the towel from her hands so he could clean Derek himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brought in a basin filled with water, and then slipped out of the VIP hospital room, leaving Brandon alone with Derek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon finished wiping Derek&#39;s back, and then positioned him onto his other side once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek remained completely unconscious, unable to help at all, so moving his solid frame proved to be a bit of a struggle even for a grown man like Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having gotten Derek onto his back, Brandon focused on cleaning the front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when he dipped the towel back into the basin did Brandon notice the water had grown cold. That meant he needed to fetch a fresh basin of hot water from the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He carried on this way, repeating each step, until Derek was finally clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire process lasted nearly half an hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he finished, Brandon&#39;s brow was damp with sweat, and he released a long, weary breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped for a moment and realized just how much energy it took to look after an elderly person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew he was stronger than Millie, but even he felt worn out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How much more exhausting was it for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Derek lying there, Brandon found his thoughts wandering to Millie and her tireless routine of daily care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat passed as Brandon looked away, grabbed the basin, and went to empty the water. Then he decided to find the doctor and ask about Derek&#39;s condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, before he reached the hallway&#39;s corner, he caught the sound of voices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My back&#39;s killing me. Taking care of a patient every single day is so tiring,&#34; remarked the caregiver he had seen earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next to her stood another caregiver, this one much slimmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think you&#39;re worn out?&#34; the slimmer caregiver replied. &#34;You&#39;re looking after Derek Watson, aren&#39;t you? Everybody knows he&#39;s the easiest to manage and he pays more than anyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek&#39;s caregiver agreed with a slow nod. &#34;That&#39;s right. Everything got harder when his daughter-in-law stopped visiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of surprise crossed the slim caregiver&#39;s face.&#34;Really? Is that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely,&#34; replied the caregiver as she reached behind to rub her aching back. &#34;She used to come by often and handled a lot of things herself. Honestly,she&#39;s more attentive than most of us in this line of work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slim caregiver looked unconvinced. &#34;Are you sure?I keep seeing people talk on the Internet about how her reputation&#39;s not great. There are rumors she ignores her husband&#39;s cheating just for a comfortable life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle tap from Derek&#39;s caregiver made her pause.&#34;You actually listen to that online gossip? We caregivers know what it takes to look after someone who&#39;s sick. The Watsons have so much money. If she was really that selfish, why would she put herself through all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the slim caregiver seemed doubtful. &#34;But what if she&#39;s just putting on an act?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek&#39;s caregiver shook her head and kept rubbing her back. &#34;If that were true, she&#39;d only need to pretend for her husband. Nobody would go this far otherwise. Didn&#39;t you notice how often Derek&#39;s been admitted lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slim caregiver offered a small nod in response</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s because the servants at home weren&#39;t giving him the best care,&#34; said Derek&#39;s caregiver with a sigh.&#34;They&#39;re not careless, of course, but she always paid extra attention, so Derek was better off with her around. And her mother-in-law had nothing to worry.But now? The poor old lady was wearing herself out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of confusion flickered across the slim caregiver&#39;s face. &#34;I thought...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They kept chatting, the conversation drifting further,while Brandon remained just out of sight,listening quietly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grandfather always meant the world to their family,so only the most trusted caregivers were chosen for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were always enough doctors, nurses,caregivers,and servants at the family&#39;s disposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, there was a clear gap between professional care and someone who truly paid attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until now, he&#39;d never given that difference much thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory returned as Millie took his hand gently and said with quiet reassurance, &#34;Brandon, you don&#39;t need to worry. I&#39;ll make sure your grandpa&#39;s looked after.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled seeing those stacks of care books she brought home, the pages covered in her notes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really had taken the time to study all those materials.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quiet glance downward, Brandon&#39;s thoughts grew heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything she set out to do, she actually followed through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crobert Hospital was located just a short distance from the sanatorium where Derek was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon found himself wondering if she might still be at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea crossed his mind-should he pay her a visit?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at Crobert Hospital, the day had already reached midday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia explained that her friend still had not responded.so she chose to visit during her own lunch hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant Alexia&#39;s brother, Giffard, ended up with the job of bringing lunch to Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving critical care unit, Millie was placed in a private room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t stress about your medical records. Reporters and paparazzi can&#39;t get your details easily. My dad runs the place, so there&#39;s nothing to worry about,&#34;said Alexia, who had been trying to comfort Millie earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The post-production work for Heavenly Melody moved fast, and the episode they shot yesterday had already made it online by today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Giffard arrived with the food, Millie was already watching television.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hoped to catch the edited version of her own performance and see how it turned out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sadly, it looked almost the same as the previous live broadcasts-poor sound quality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It appeared Charles still had not found a way to handle Oakley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make matters worse, something downright sickening showed up on screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Millie performed, the program suddenly shifted to Vivian, watching from the judges&#39; backstage lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian, with eyes tinged red, remarked, &#34;Her singing is wonderful.It brings back so many memories.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as tears gathered in her eyes, she managed to look strong while she talked about her life before she became famous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In those days, Vivian Floral Design was nowhere near as successful as it is now, and I was just another florist hoping to get by,&#34; said Vivian. &#34;Then there was this chance and | decided to compete for the Watson Group&#39;s floral contracts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The odds seemed against her, since plenty of people wanted the job. She added, &#34;I honestly didn&#39;t think l stood a chance, but the contract ended up being split into several parts, and l managed to win a small section supplying flowers to the CEO&#39;s office and the secretary&#39;s department.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That partnership is what gave me the chance to meet Mr. Watson in person for the first time.&#34; Vivian gave a light laugh. &#34;He&#39;s even more impressive personally than he is on television.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was how her ties with the Watson Group first began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disgust twisted in Millie&#39;s stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she knew they had a history that went way back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian kept reminiscing about her experiences with Brandon on TV, but then someone grabbed the remote and switched channels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Millie glanced up, she caught Giffard grinning at her,waving the remote playfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why watch her?&#34; Giffard asked. &#34;You&#39;d have a better time looking at me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At work, Giffard always got things done, but in moments like this, he was anything but serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie couldn&#39;t help but roll her eyes. &#34;Why would I want to look at you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising the lunchbox for her to see, Giffard grinned.&#34;How about looking at what I brought for you to eat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brought the box closer and took in the scent.&#34;It smells so good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh slipped out of Millie before she could stop herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their conversation carried on, and at that same moment, an Aston Martin rolled into the parking lot of Crobert Hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon climbed out of the car and kept his gaze locked on the doors leading into the inpatient department.</p>
