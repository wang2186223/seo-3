                <p>Ten million dollars!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was unbelievable! The price had increased tenfold!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock rippled through the crowd, and for a couple of seconds,nobody said a word. Then the silence broke.and the place exploded with frantic voices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s still biddingl&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoever&#39;s at Seat 823 realy wants to go head-to-head with Brandon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That takes some nerve!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we about to witness something historic here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bet Brandon&#39;s never had anyone push him like this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Voices echoed all over, nearly drowning out every other sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian shot a glare toward Seat 823,her jaw tight with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was struggling to figure out Serena&#39;s endgame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An idea flashed in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she turned her back to Brandon,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>careful not to draw attention, and quietly typed out a message to someone</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side, Brandon lifted his hand again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bidder number 888 is still in the running. The new offer is twelve million dollars!&#34; the auctioneer called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Twelve million-now it&#39;s twelve times the original!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gosh, this is crazy! How far will this go? Will she keep pushing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single piece of tanzanite was now worth twelve million dollars!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement swept across the entire hall, and the l spotlights focused on the two second-floor seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was whispering to one another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s doing this on purpose-she&#39;s just driving up the price! There&#39;s no way this is fair!&#34; someone screamed from somewhere in the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, the entire room went quiet before bursting into noise once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People glanced around, searching for the speaker,but the person was already long gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few people chimed in, supporting that thought,&#34;Honestly, Brandon has already promised to outbid anyone for the tanzanite, but she keeps pushing the price higher. Maybe she&#39;s just trying to make Brandon pay an extra fortune for that gem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The majority, however, seemed to treat it all like a show and didn&#39;t care what her reasons might be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon isn&#39;t clueless. Since he made that promise about the tanzanite, you&#39;d think he saw this coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another person added, &#34;Yeah, Brandon chose to go down this road. He&#39;s not the type to be scared off by someone else trying to outbid him. On top of that.this sum barely means anything to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the noise rising, the auctioneer stepped in,hoping to keep things under control. &#34;Distinguished guests, please keep your composure. At Evans Group Auction House, we do not permit any form of malicious bidding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People simply ignored him, since everyone at this charity auction belonged to a world where normal rules did not always apply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the conversation heated up and some guests began pulling out their phones, clearly aiming to share what was happening, a sudden flurry of sharp, quick knocks captured the entire room&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, every light focused on the high platform above the second floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wheelchair slowly came into view. There sat Napier Evans, unmistakably present in his wheelchair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up the microphone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening, everyone.&#34; Napier&#39;s words, though carried by an aged voice, rang out with steady authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, all conversation came to a halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bidder number 888,&#34; Napier announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon lifted his gaze to the platform, giving Napier a respectful nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bidder number 823,&#34; Napier called out again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In response, Millie rose slowly from her seat, drawing every eye in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the curious eyes of everyone present, she moved out from the shadows and took her place by the second-floor railing, just as Brandon had done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the spotlight shining directly on her, the silver satin gown she wore seemed to make her even more striking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her gaze toward Napier, she offered a polite nod to show her respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Napier addressed the room, saying, &#34;Is there anyone else who wishes to bid on this tanzanite?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence followed. Nobody answered, and not a single person made a move. After allowing about half a minute to pass, Napier gave a nod and continued, &#34;Very well. I want to ask both of you directly, are you participating in this bidding of your own free will?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both participants signaled their agreement by raising their hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Napier lifted his own hand, and immediately, the lighting in the room shifted, transforming the entire atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the sound of a dramatic drumroll in the background, Napier spoke once more. &#34;Everyone here should know that I am fully aware of both parties &#39; circumstances. I, Napier Evans, along with the Evans Group, promise that this auction is being conducted fairly,without any ill intentions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People began glancing at each other, curiosity written across their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This turn of events made everything even more captivating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No schemes, no attempts at publicity-simply two determined bidders, each genuinely wanting the tanzanite for personal reasons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every single bid from bidder 823 must have come from sincere intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just what was happening in this auction? Brandon&#39;s brow tightened as he watched Millie stand so quietly across from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not return his gaze: instead, she simply lowered her eyes for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Napier had always known who she was. She once asked Charles to keep her identity a secret when she donated this stone to the charity auction tonight,but nothing could escape Napier&#39;s notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Charles happened to be Napier&#39;s own grandson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps Napier had even already figured out that the tanzanite was intended as a gift to mark the birth of her child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given all that, it made sense that she did not want her husband to win the stone, only for him to hand it over to another woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nobody who would find fault with her motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,could it really be so simple?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s eyes flickered with a touch of irony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even knowing there was no chance to win, she kept bidding with everything she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie knew better than to act recklessly. She lifted her head once more, her eyes locking with Brandon&#39;s as a faint smile touched her red lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was watching her just as intently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, it seemed like some unseen barrier separated the two of them from everyone else,leaving only the two locked in their silent battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tense mind game had begun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon held the clear advantage with his fortune and influence, while Millie seemed wrapped in a quiet,mysterious confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon drew his brows together, deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found himself wondering who this woman really was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through all his years dealing with people in the business world, never had he met anyone quite so unpredictable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Napier&#39;s voice carried down from above. &#34;I will take charge and lead this next part of the auction myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The energy in the room spiked once more after a brief moment of calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Evans himself is stepping in! When was the last time he did that?!&#34; someone exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This really is a moment for the history books!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think we&#39;ll see a repeat of those legendary auctions he ran twenty years ago?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As another round of sharp, steady knocks echoed, the noise began to fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every eye turned to the three focal points in the room:the elevated platform above, Seat 888, and Seat 823.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Napier&#39;s commanding voice rang out. &#34;We are continuing with the bids. Bidder number 888 stands at twelve million dollars. Is there a higher offer?&#34;</p>
