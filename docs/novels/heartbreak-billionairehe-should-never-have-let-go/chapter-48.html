                <p>Excitement burst through the entire room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of energy carried the auctioneer&#39;s voice as he called out, &#34;Bidder number 888 just made a bold move!Let&#39;s give him a big hand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Applause thundered fromn every corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every eye in the room could feel the tension rising-this was the climax of the auction!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before,people had whispered among themselves, but now voices rang out as everyone started talking and shouting without restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow! It&#39;s been forever since a charity auction was this dramatic!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right! The last time we saw anything like this was a year ago, all for that antique cup. The bids just kept climbing until some mystery bidder swept in with a twelve-billion-dollar offer and ended it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget the one three years back. A single painting set off a bidding war, and another mysterious bidder snatched it for seven billion!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And there was also that modern art sculpture in Flaville-another seven-billion-dollar finish, all thanks to an anonymous buyer!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loud chatter filled the space, with one person turning to his friends in confusion. &#34;You keep talking about these record bids, but what&#39;s actually happening right now? I still don&#39;t get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick answer came back. &#34;It&#39;s all about Brandon&#39;s signal. He&#39;s letting everyone know he&#39;s not backing down-he&#39;s going to keep bidding for that tanzanite,no matter how high it goes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The puzzled guest tried again. &#34;But can anyone just do that? What if they can&#39;t pay up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone else leaned in and explained, &#34;The auction house has rules for this. The Evans family runs a tight ship. I heard of one person who tried and couldn&#39;t cover the bid, and the fallout? Wasn&#39;t pretty. We&#39;re all guests of the Evans Group, so they&#39;re definitely in control. Even at smaller auctions, they check that bidders have the money first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thoughtful nod followed.&#34;That makes sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another voice chimed in, &#34;But there&#39;s nothing to worry about this time-this is Brandon Watson we&#39;re talking about!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone agreed, because Brandon was the face of the Watson family-the most powerful name out of Crobert&#39;s three leading families!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lighting in the venue first faded, but then flared back to life,filling the room with bursts of color that swept across the entire space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the quiet streets around the mansion transformed as clusters of drones filled the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every drone glowed brightly, hovering in formation and painting intricate patterns high above the estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s all this? Did something happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No clue. What&#39;s going on inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Somebody go check! Whatever it is, it must be big!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the mansion, screens projected a live feed of the scene outside. Inside and out, everything was a whirlwind of activity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A question suddenly rose above the noise. &#34;Has Brandon ever gone this far at an auction before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone answered, &#34;He actually did, once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? How come I never heard about it? What was he bidding for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thoughtful look crossed the person&#39;s face before they replied, &#34;It happened seven years ago, if l remember right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seven years ago?&#34; the listener asked, surprised. &#34;He would have been so young.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick nod confirmed it. &#34;That&#39;s right. He was just a teenager, and the thing he wanted was pretty unusual.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interest only deepened. &#34;What was it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment&#39;s hesitation, and then the answer came. &#34;It was a document.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;People auction off documents?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, apparently. The details are fuzzy, since the auction was private. Only a few people even know it happened. I stumbled on the story by chance, but l never heard the full tale.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far away on the second floor, Vivian stared at Brandon,her heart racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she realized what Brandon was doing, Vivian found it almost impossible to stay seated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rush of excitement faded into a deep satisfaction,giving her the feeling that everything was falling into place as she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among all the men in Crobert, Brandon held power and status above anyone else-he was the type women would do anything to win over. Yet here he was,making such a bold move just for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victory felt close enough for Vivian to taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With barely any effort, she managed to get Brandon to prove his love for her in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All at once, it became clear-his feelings for her ran far deeper than anything he had ever felt for Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Brandon, Vivian noticed his calm face as he stared straight at Serena, waiting to see her reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly smile tugged at Vivian&#39;s lips, eager for the moment Serena would have no choice but to accept defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Charles sat beside Millie, his anger simmering to the point of eruption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just what is Brandon thinking?&#34; Charles blurted out,leaping to his feet. If Millie hadn&#39;t grabbed his arm,he might have stormed over to confront Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Allowing Vivian to use his paddle was already bad enough. Even if he let her bid against you for the tanzanite, I could try to excuse it by saying he didn&#39;t know what the stone realy meant. But this?&#34; Charles&#39;s frustration left him breathless. &#34;Right here, going this far for his lover at a public auction packed with reporters, where the whole world will hear about it-what kind of position does this leave you, who is still legally married to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at Millie, Charles saw nothing but calm, and his anger grew heavy with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was aware that while the auction might be private within these walls, the moment it ended,everything would become public knowledge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reporter, and certainly not Vivian, would ever let such a story slip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brandon&#39;s wife, Millie would be the talk of the town by then,ridiculed by all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, people had no clue that Serena and Millie were the same person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the truth ever came out... it&#39;d only be more humiliating for Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles didn&#39;t even want to imagine the fallout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie simply stared at Brandon, her expression hidden behind the white mask, her feelings impossible to guess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seven years was all it took to turn Brandon into someone she barely recognized, able to shift all his former tenderness toward someone new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A memory flitted by-Brandon at thatprivate auction seven years ago, his right hand held high as he placed a bid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Millie&#39;s lips formed a faint, ironic smile,her eyes remaining cold and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Serena, do you want to keep bidding?&#34; Charles asked,his voice tight with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a calm smile answered him. Millie looked unbothered by the show of money and influence-her smile never faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colorful lights swirled as the auctioneer called out with energy, &#34;The auction isn&#39;t over yet! Please continue placing your bids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his attention never left the seat marked 823.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone&#39;s eyes followed, each person eager to see what choice the woman holding that number would make.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the next moment, a hand reached out from the darkness, raising the paddle marked 823.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new bid followed immediately after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen above the stage changed,displaying a new offer-five million dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, the auctioneer stared at the number, and  then glanced up at the bidder on the second floor,double-checking just to be sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, his voice rang out for all to hear. &#34;Bidder number 823 is still in the game with a new bid of five million!&#34;</p>
