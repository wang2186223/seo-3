                <p>Vivian expected Eugene to agree immediately, but to her surprise,he hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Simpson, I can&#39;t promise anything. You&#39;ll need to speak to Mr. Watson directly. Without his instruction, I can&#39;t make this decision,&#34; Eugene said, his voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t reached his position by being reckless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>that so? I understand. Sorry to trouble you,&#34; Vivian replied with a soft smile, though she was seething inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she married Brandon, she would make sure Eugene got replaced immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in a long while, she felt like she was hitting a wall at every turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no other option, she walked over to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon,&#34; she said hesitantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon looked at her and gave a small nod, signaling her to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian leaned in close and whispered in his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Brandon,&#34; she said, her tone pleading. &#34;This is actually about a family feud within the Evans family. Oakley and Charles had a fight. I saw Oakley backstage, and things were heated. But the public doesn&#39;t know better, so they&#39;re blaming me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes turned red with emotion. &#34;I&#39;m not afraid of rumors. I just don&#39;t want all my efforts to be misunderstood. I&#39;ve never had much time left, and all I want is to leave behind something good. If I&#39;m wrongly accused, everything I&#39;ve done will be stained. You know that&#39;s not what I want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cleverly shifted the blame onto Oakley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon looked at her quietly. His feelings were complicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew about the feud between the Evans brothers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had also spoken to him before about why she wanted to join the show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as she spoke, Millie&#39;s face suddenly appeared in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Watson Group didn&#39;t even have an entertainment arm-until Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That department had been created just for her, even though she was signed with Evans Entertainment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It eventually grew to support other artists, but the biggest share of resources always went to Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew it too, but she insisted on honoring her contract with Evans Entertainment and never once asked to break it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After marrying Brandon, she quietly stepped away from music and never brought it up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian noticed Brandon&#39;s silence and kept her pitiful expression in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t want to, it&#39;s fine,&#34; she said with a forced smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon finally looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was time to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had changed. She didn&#39;t need those thing he built for her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed. &#34;Tell Eugene it&#39;s from me,&#34; Brandon said at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? Thank you, Brandon!&#34; Vivian&#39;s face lit up, and she rushed to call Eugene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon didn&#39;t look at her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something made him raisehis head and&#39;glance down the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There,he saw Serena standing quietly,watching him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles then stepped out from the shadows and gently draped his coat over her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said something to her. Serena looked away, and the two of them walked off together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers spread: Speculation grew. Public opinion began to shift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian has always stayed true to her values. Whether it&#39;s Heavenly Melody or her charity work, she just wants to inspire others before her time runs out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! She&#39;s almost at the end of her life. Why would she care about pushing Serena down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard it&#39;s a family feud-Oakley and Charles. This isn&#39;t about Vivian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian doesn&#39;t even have six months left. Blaming her just seems wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah... It&#39;s just too cruel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie scrolled through the comments and smniled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, Vivian&#39;s illness would always win sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles sat beside her, seething.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is he even thinking?&#34; he snapped. They both knew who	&#34;he&#34;was. &#34;Should we go with that plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though they had evidence against Vivian&#39;s PR team, the players involved now were from the Watson Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evidence they had wouldn&#39;t help much anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So we&#39;re letting her off?&#34; Charles asked through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie laughed. &#34;Not a chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But she-&#34; Charles glanced toward the nearby camera, careful with his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s desperate now. And it&#39;s going to cost her,&#34; Millie said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles leaned closer, his eyes lighting up.&#34;You mean...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie lowered her gaze and began typing on her phone beneath the table. &#34;First, Vivian stabbed Oakley in the back. They may still look like allies, but that kind of betrayal leaves a scar. Second, she used the Watson Group&#39;s resources. Even if she manages to clear her name, her image is already tainted.People will begin to doubt her. Most importantly, she&#39;s panicking. Sympathy only works a few times.Overdo it, and people start getting tired. You can&#39;t fake your way through forever. The more she tries to fix this now, the stronger the backlash later. She used the Watson Group because she&#39;s desperate.That means the end is close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles nodded quickly as he read her message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was too impatient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hot temper had always been a double-edged sword-he got things done, but it brought problems too.He had learned to control it over the years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if he wanted to keep up with Millie, he had to master patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, we&#39;ve already won,&#34; Millie said with a smile, handing her phone to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Vivian was no longer under attack like they wished to, good news was that Serena was now swimming in praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First came the positive comments. Then well-known influencers began doing reactions on her songs,pointing out the details and difficulty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, online musicians were trying to replicate herhigh notes in Deep Sea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The buzz exploded, drawing in even more people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Back during the first round, everyone argued over whether Glimmer of Love or Yesterday was better.Now it&#39;s clear-Yesterday takes the crown!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right? Vivian&#39;s song is beautiful, but she&#39;s not a pro. Serena&#39;s song is more technical and heartfelt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Glimmer of Love is nice, but the live version didn&#39;t hit. Not surprising though-Vivian isn&#39;t a trained singer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Either way, Serena&#39;s amazing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like that, Serena&#39;s commercial value skyrocketed overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The live show inched toward its grand finale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each singer gave it their all, and with every elimination, fans felt a sense of loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The live broadcast that stirred so much passion finally came to an end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie hadn&#39;t expected Vivian to make a fatal mistake at the very last moment.</p>
