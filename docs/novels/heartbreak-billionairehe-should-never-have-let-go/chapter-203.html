                <p>This was the first time Myron and Brandon had met alone since their last heated argument, and Brandon seemed calmer now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stood at a distance, studying each other in silence, Then Myron offered a faint smile and asked,&#34;Care fora drink?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a private room at Blue Lounge, Myron held his glass and watched Brandon, who had already emptied one and sat with his head bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of them spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron was waiting. He wanted Brandon to be the one to speak first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon poured another drink. Just before he finished it, he asked, &#34;Why did you do it? &#34;What do you mean?&#34; Myron replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie.&#34; Brandon said her name clearly, his eyes fixed on Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| thought I made it clear last time. I like her. I&#39;m pursuing her,&#34; Myron replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s brow tightened as he stared at Myron,not with anger this time, but with intent. He looked like a man trying to peel back layers, searching for what lay beneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myron,&#34; he said, &#34;from what I know of you, you wouldn&#39;t like someone like her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron let out a quiet laugh. &#34;There&#39;s a lot you don&#39;t know about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s tone turned sharp. &#34;So you spent years exiled at sea and only now decided you like her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron lowered his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those years had indeed been exile imposed by his family,though few knew the truth. His branch had not held power then. Someone else in the Elliott family had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron had been forced to survive on his own,building shipping routes and amassing resources.Shipping had become the core of his empire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had formed an intricate web-routes, ports, trade partners, all tightly bound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gem business was only one part of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dealt in far more. If it moved through customs,he took a cut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But few people understood just how much he really controlled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Brandon only knew Myron had been exiled by his family, not the extent of what followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those years taught Myron brutal lessons. He faced betrayal, loss, and the painful cost of trust. He once believed loyalty didn&#39;t exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until he met Millie. He had seen her love someone else with everything she had. He watched her throw herself into that love,again and again, without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, he only observed. Then came envy. And eventually, jealousy. Night after night, it grew stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In time, he realized he wanted her. Not to admire from afar-but to have her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even while she loved someone else, he had already fallen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong? Hard to answer?&#34; Brandon asked,pulling him back to the present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know as much as I do that human nature is complicated to begin with, Brandon,&#34; Myron said.&#34;There&#39;s no need to ask such childish things. But if you want a clear answer, here it is. I do like Millie.I&#39;ve never lied to you about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set his glass down and looked at Brandon, who seemed unable to hide the bitterness on his face. &#34;Haven&#39;t you already chosen Vivian?&#34; Myron asked.&#34;While you kept turning your back on Millie, do you know how many times she cried for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stared at him in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If your decision is made, then don&#39;t look back,&#34;Myron said. &#34;Let her go. Stop hurting her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| can&#39;t.&#34; Brandon&#39;s eyes turned red. &#34;I can&#39;t live without her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron frowned and stayed quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could have anyone,&#34; Brandon said, his voice low. &#34;Why does it have to be her? She&#39;s not the only one-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you know that?&#34; Myron interrupted, cutting him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon fell silent, stunned by the intensity in Myron&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, he understood something clearly for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron was serious. He wasn&#39;t playing a game. He truly/ wanted Millie. And only her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night was cool. Millie lay alone in the bathtub,surrounded by warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steam rose around her, softening the edges of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at the water, her thoughts drifting through everything that had happened-recent events, old memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was only twenty-five, but life had already spun her through one storm after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her marriage to Brandon was beyond repair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to dwell on the past. She wanted to keep moving forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought of Myron, and the look in his eyes.Warm.Steady.Full of affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dropped her gaze and stared at her reflection in the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, she had felt it too. That subtle,fluttering feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was the heat. Maybe it was something more. Her heart began to race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should she accept him? Should she allow herself to return those feelings?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts grew hazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>BackK at Blue Lounge, Myron had already left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stayed behind, drinking one glass after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dull ache pressed against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t breathe. So he drank. Only that gave him a brief escape. A fleeting numbness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the more he drank, the more Millie&#39;s face came into focus. Myron wanted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert was also watching for a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles and Giffard,too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bitterness inside Brandon deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t let go. In his mind, Millie could only ever belong to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Myron sat in the back of the Bentley,heading home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked out the window, taking in the quiet scenery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weather was good. His mood was pleasant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought about the look Millie had given him earlier. The hint of warmth in her eyes. He smiled, his heart feeling lighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car passed through the gates of Elliott Mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon was in the living room, playing with Kiki. He greeted Myron as he stepped into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron returned the greeting, and then walked straight to his study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laid out a sheet of paper and picked up a charcoal pencil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stroke by stroke, he drew the image that had stayed in his mind all evening-Millie&#39;s eyes, filled with feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at the finished sketch. His eyes softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, he placed the drawing in a frame and moved to another room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the door. The lights came on, revealing rows of shelves that lined the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked slowly toward an empty one, the new painting in hs hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the corner of the paper, he wrote the date. Then he set it on the stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next to it hung another drawing-MAillie crouched down, feeding Kiki with treats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood still, letting his gaze drift across the room.Every shelf. Every frame. Every image. All of them were of the same person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie.</p>
