                <p>&#34;Not yet. Feels like something bigger is about to drop,&#34;another replied quickly. &#34;If we reveal it now, it&#39;ll kill the impact. Better to wait a little longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian still didn&#39;t fully grasp the truth about how the showbiz worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The number of recording devices publicly listed never matched the real count.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were always extra cameras, hidden mics, and people recording on the sly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was where the big scoops came from-the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And even then, only a small part of the mess ever reached the public. Most were bought off before it could make headlines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Backstage, the stage manager leaned over and said,&#34;The second performer&#39;s almost done.Serena, get ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the cue, Millie stepped out into the lights.Out in the audience,Brandon stood. He hadn&#39;t planned to stay long</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Events like this weren&#39;t his thing, and he&#39;d only come to see Vivian perform.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that she was done, he saw no reason to remain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he had barely taken a few steps when the third contestant walked onstage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And now, please welcome to the stage-Serena Ellsworth,&#34; the host announced. The name caught his attention. Vivian had mentioned Serena before,calling her Charles&#39; secret lover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t thought much of it then. But now, for some reason,he paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People had been whispering about this woman all day -the contestant in the mask. Now, here she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped to the center of the stage,her hands relaxed around the mic. The first few notes left her lips-soft,steady, threaded with something intimate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room hushed itself. The crowd, which had been whispering just seconds ago, fell into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon frowned slightly. There was something familiar about the way she sang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not the voice exactly. but the tone The vibe was close to Millie&#39;s style. But it vasn&#39;t a copy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena&#39;s voice was deeper, more seasoned. There was a quiet sadness in the way she held her notes-like someone who&#39;d walked through fire and didn&#39;t need to talk about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t dramatic. But it lingered. Soft, and then sharp.and then gone-like smoke. But it stayed with you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s eyes narrowed as he looked closer. The woman on stage was dressed in a rose-red outfit that flared like flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her figure and styling were all wrong for Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t be Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the performance moved on, the soft hum grew curling upward into a rising swell until Millie&#39;s voice broke through, clear and fierce, shattering the quiet and carrying the song to its peak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lights flared. Fire danced around the stage in bursts. Then everything went dark. A single spotlight switched on. Millie stood in its center, holding a violin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Petals fell from above, drifting around her like snow.Then came the music. Not soft. Not sweet. It tore through the room-aching and beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She played in her red dress. The spotlight shifted,casting a clearer view of her arms, her collarbone,her shoulders-bruises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely covered with makeup, they revealed themselves under the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They ran along her skin, more visible near her joints - rougher patches that told the story of deep Wounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, the music and the image struck something in the audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flames that surrounded her weren&#39;t just for effect.It was a return. She was a woman reborn. A phoenix rising from the ashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stood beneath the lights, dressed in deep red,the violin pressed against her shoulder. Each note she drew out carved through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The music built, sharp and unyielding, and not a single gaze turned away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To those watching, she was now more than a performer-she was someone who had walked through fire and come out shining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after the last note faded and the flames slipped into silence, the audience remained still, held in the weight of what they had just witnessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie lowered her violin slowly, her gaze lifting just in time to see Brandon nearby</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s brow drew in slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart thudded harder than it should have. Maybe it was the intensity of the performance. Or maybe it was something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something about her. Dangerous. Distant.But impossible to look away from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the applause began-loud, rising like a wave.swallowing the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surrounded by claps and cheers that filled the air,it was Brandon who looked away first, quietly turning his back on her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Millie said softly from the stago,her voice steady, almost too calm for what had just happened</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon glanced over at Charles,who looked thrilled</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But all Brandon could think about were her bruisos What kind of man let his woman suffer like that and seemed more focused on the song than her pain?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,he reminded himself-it was none of his business</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t his woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, Brandon turned and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On stage, Millie gave a deep bow to the audience and followed the staff&#39;s cue to exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offstage,Barbara rushed over, nearly bouncing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Serena, that was incredible! I mean it-I got chills!&#34;she said, clutching Millie&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie flinched a little but still gave her a small smile.&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had only rested for three days. It wasn&#39;t enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before, she remained seated as much as she could.But up there on stage, she hadn&#39;t held back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,her body was catching up to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Serena, who did your special effects makeup? These bruises look unbelievably real!&#34; Barbara leaned closer,eyes wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Careful,&#34; Charles said, stepping in quickly and pulling Barbara aside. &#34;Those aren&#39;t fake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Barbara froze. She looked down at her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The makeup had smeared slightly, revealing the raw truth underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no...&#34;&#39; Barbara covered her mouth, her voice shaking. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean to-Serena, I&#39;m so sorry, I didn&#39;t know-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie let out a quiet laugh and gave a small shake of her head. Barbara didn&#39;t know any better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara looked like she might cry. Millie leaned against her with a whisper of a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could you lend me a hand? I&#39;m really at my limit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course!&#34; Barbara immediately looped her arm under Millie&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But they didn&#39;t get far. Just a few steps in, V/ivian appeared, blocking the path with a perfectly timed smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your performance was stunning,&#34; she said. &#34;Truly.Congratulations,Serena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked at herbut said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian went on, still smiling. &#34;Remember what I told you earlier? About that person? I wasn&#39;t lying. If you want the full story, come to me later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around them, applause still echoed faintly through the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie let out a light laugh. &#34;No need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Charles briefly. He didn&#39;t understand what she meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,without another word, she left with Barbara and Charles beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian stayed behind, watching their backs disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had come to provoke, to shake her. If anything,Serena had gone out and stolen the entire show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after the performance had started, she had stormed into the control room and used Brandon&#39;s name to pressure the staff-asking them to lower Serena&#39;s broadcast quality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Vivian, Serena was completely oblivious-this was her moment, yet Serena had the nerve to draw all the light to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s eyes narrowed, calculating. She pulled out her phone and dialed, her mind already spinning with her next move.</p>
