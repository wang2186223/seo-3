                <p>Vivian saw no need for another meeting with Eva; at this point, it was just a meaningless gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, Eva&#39;s name was already listed as a contributor-if Evans Entertainment or Eva herself wanted to stir up drama, she&#39;d paint the whole thing as a desperate attempt by a nobody to chase clout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, she had the perfect scapegoats lined up. If things got messy, Vivian could simply claim the entire debacle was a calculated ploy masterminded by Millie and Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Vivian&#39;s mind, the cleanest outcome was Eva quietly pocketing the money. But if Eva refused and forced things into court, VVivian wasn&#39;t worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time any legal storm settled, she&#39;d be comfortably married to Brandon, protected from any</p>
                
                
                
                <p>fallout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her confidence swelled-her plan was airtight and nothing could go wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the hospital, Millie tucked Ari in and went to double-check the copyright registration for her song.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t shake a nagging sense of confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What exactly was Vivian aiming for?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The copyright registration was as clear as day and Eva would win in court without breaking a sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The infringement wasn&#39;t really massive, and if Vivian could drag things out with high-powered attorneys,at worst, she&#39;d end up with a slap on the wrist-a public apology, a fine, and an end to the unauthorized use. StiIl, Vivian&#39;s public image would be shattered regardless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Vivian really so hell-bent on winning that she&#39;d risk her entire reputation, justfor the chance to marry Brandon before her time ran out? Did she actually believe she could control the timing and twist things in her favor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie couldn&#39;t make sense of it. No matter how she looked at it, Vivian&#39;s scheme seemed self-destructive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Brandon gave up trying to change Vivian&#39;s mind and drove away, frustration simmering beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he passed the psychiatric clinic where he and Vivian had once visited, a memory surfaced-the doctor had said some documents would be mailed to his place. But up until that very morning, nothing had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uneasy, Brandon pulled over and walked into the facility, hoping to get answers. At the front desk, he learned the doctor he needed was out for the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a patient sigh, he laid out his issue to the receptionist. &#34;Documents are usually processed by the archive.You can check with them,&#34; the receptionist advised,gesturing politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave a silent nod and stepped out, missing the hushed exchange between the receptionist and a nearby staff member as soon as the door swung shut behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that new guy stationed in archive now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. He used to mess things all the time in his old department. After a huge blowup with his supervisor,they shipped him off to records. But he&#39;s still making a mess over there-no one can keep up with his screw-ups. Honestly, I&#39;m tired just thinking about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s hope that gentleman gets his paperwork sorted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As their conversation lingered in the air, Rita came over, catching the end of it. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; she asked, her tone light but curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist perked up instantly.&#34;Oh,Rita,let me fill you in...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By then, Brandon had already made his way to the archive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found a young man sprawled lazily across a chair,barely keeping his eyes open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s brow furrowed as he stepped closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here to inquire about a mailed document,&#34; he said, his tone even but edged with impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man behind the desk barely stirred-he looked half-awake,bleary-eyed, rubbing sleep from his face as if it would clear his mind. &#34;What are you looking for?&#34; he mumbled, blinking at Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| haven&#39;t received a document I was expecting. I&#39;d like to check its status,&#34; Brandon replied, voice clipped but polite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; the man grunted, massaging his temples before fumbling for his glasses. He perched them crookedly on his nose, logged into the mail tracking system, and glanced up. &#34;Name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian Simpson,&#34; Brandon answered automatically,assuming they wanted the patient&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the man began typing, Rita strode in, her heels striking the floor with quiet authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on here?&#34; she asked, giving both men a sharp look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man straightened instantly, suddenly alert.&#34;A patient&#39;s family member is here to check the status of a mailed document,&#34; he said, eager to explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s expression shifted-she&#39;d already heard about why Brandon was here from the receptionist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, she replayed the scene from the other day when Vivian had left the doctor&#39;s office with Brandon and then come back alone, deep in conversation with the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Rita couldn&#39;t recall every detail, she suspected they&#39;d discussed changing the delivery address.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon, meanwhile, seemed completely in the dark. &#34;I understand,&#34; Rita said calmly. &#34;Please check what went wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away, Dr. Carpenter,&#34; the man replied,springing into action. After a moment, he turned to Brandon. &#34;The document&#39;s already been sent out and signed off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s brow furrowed as he pressed. &#34;But I never received it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verify the address to see if there was any mistake,&#34;Rita directed, her tone steady but firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On it!&#34; The man double-checked, and then read out the destination, finishing with, &#34;Vivian Floral Design,Vivian Simpson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the address on record,&#34; he said, shooting a quick, uncertain look at Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon kept glancing at Rita, unsettled by the strange undercurrent in her demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the man read out the delivery address however, Brandon&#39;s gaze sharpened. Had he gotten it wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was certain he&#39;d given his own address-so how did the document end up at Vivian&#39;s studio?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man looked up and inquired, &#34;Is something wrong,sir?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon forced a tight smile and shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you print another copy for me right now?&#34;Brandon asked, hoping to collect it in person and avoid the hassle of waiting for mail again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, sir. But I&#39;ll need to verify your identity first,&#34; the man replied with a calm tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave a slight nod and handed over his ID without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the man started to key in Brandon&#39;s name, Rita quickly stepped in. &#34;You&#39;ll find the authorization notes faster in the patient&#39;s medical record. If the recipient was able to receive the mail, there should already be a record of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man offered a quick nod, pulled up Vivian&#39;s medical file, checked the necessary details, and,after confirming the authorization, returned the ID to Brandon. &#34;Please hold on. I&#39;ll print it for you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; Brandon said, slipping his ID back into his wallet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Rita, though she kept it hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reminded herself that she needed to call Milie to update her emergency contact-something they&#39;d clearly let slip through the cracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon had always been listed as Millie&#39;s emergency contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since her health was steadily improving and she rarely needed to reach out to anyone for medical emergency, nobody had bothered to update the information. But overhearing the receptionist&#39;s casual chatter jolted Rita into sudden unease-a flash of dread tightening her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man in the archive had a reputation for : carelessness. Rita couldn&#39;t shake the worry about what damage he might uInwittingly cause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d already earned himself a string of blunders back when he worked the front desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he decided to look up Brandon&#39;s name in the system and accidentally accessed Millie&#39;s confidential file, it would be a clear violation of patient privacy-something the clinic was supposed to protect at all costs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worse, Rita knew Millie would never want Brandon to find out she&#39;d been seeing a psychiatrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that detail slipped out, it would be a catastrophic lapse for the facility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, Rita had kept her guard up and intervened just in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she hadn&#39;t, things could&#39;ve easily spiraled out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, the records clerk finished printing, slid the document into a folder, and passed it across the counter to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks&#34; Brandon murmured, and then requested the man update the address back to his own apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita lingered silently nearby, keeping her expression neutral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made sure her gaze never drifted toward the computer monitor-she hadn&#39;t caught a glimpse of any confidential details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the paperwork was sorted out, Brandon walked off with the folder tucked under his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita grabbed a few supplies from the archive,feigning a casual errand as she slipped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as she turned the corner, she nearly collided with Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blocked her path with a measured look. &#34;Do you have a minute to talk?&#34; he asked.</p>
