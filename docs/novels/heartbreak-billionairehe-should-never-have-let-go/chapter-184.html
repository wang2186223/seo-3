                <p>The following morning, MMillie stepped into the marble lobby of Evans Entertainment, arriving a few minutes ahead of schedule. She&#39;d deliberately timed it so she&#39;d have a chance to meet with Charles before Brandon showed up-she wanted to nail down the Elliott Group endorsement details without distractions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kicked things off by filling Charles in on the latest developments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The samples she inspected alongside Myron and Adriana remained prototypes, unshaped stones poised for transformation into finished gems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Elliott Group&#39;s new products are positioned for the mid-to-high-end market just as they promised in our last contract,&#34; he noted, his gaze steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded in agreement. &#34;Exactly. Plus,the Elliott Group&#39;s given me a ton of creative freedom for the endorsement, so I&#39;ve got an idea that I want to run by you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles gestured for her to continue, a hint of a smile playing at his lips. &#34;Let&#39;s hear it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie brightened, her eyes lighting up with enthusiasm.&#34;Let&#39;s try something strategic-we can link each new song to a particular Elliott Group gemstone, but not in a way that forces people to buy both. Think of it as a pairing: every gem has its own song. The cross-promotion would be massive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles considered the idea, tapping his pen thoughtfully. &#34;It&#39;s clever. But what if people push back?Vivian will jump at any excuse to cause chaos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why we have to keep a sharp line between the endorsement and the songs.&#34; Millie&#39;s lips curved in a confident, reassuring smile. &#34;I&#39;ll handle the endorsement-Millie as brand ambassador. But the music? That&#39;s Eva&#39;s domain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m listening.&#34; Charles leaned in, curiosity sharpening his gaze. Millie&#39;s contact was managed by Evans Entertainment, and any lucrative payoff would benefit them both. But even if the company made little-or took a loss-Charles had already decided: he&#39;d back Millie all the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Millie prepared to elaborate, a brisk knock sounded at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Evans, the Watson Group representatives are here,&#34; the assistant declared from the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Take them to the first meeting room,&#34; he instructed, already shifting gears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie caught his eye, her lips curving into a knowing half-smile. &#34;Let&#39;s go meet them first. I&#39;ll fill you in later-though I have a feeling you&#39;ve already pieced most of it together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt of anticipation ran through Charles; every time he teamed up with Millie and set to make something big, he felt a surge of adrenaline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d been watching Oakley&#39;s every move, eager to seize the upper hand, but Oakley hadn&#39;t shown his hand yet. For now,patience was his only weapon..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, let&#39;s do this!&#34; Charles replied, his voice upbeat.He passed Millie the last few items she&#39;d requested for her disguise,his excitement barely contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting room felt like a walk-in freezer, the air conditioning blasting as Millie and Charles strode in together, their bulky frog costumes swallowing every hint of their real selves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon and Vivian exchanged bewildered glances,clearly thrown off by the spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian squinted, her confusion evident. &#34;Can someone please explain what&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles tugged off his oversized frog head, tousling his damp hair as he spoke. &#34;We&#39;ve got a big company event today. You caught us just as we finished, so we came straight over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie wrestled with her own headpiece, fumbling with the clasp, but it refused to budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles shot her a sympathetic look. &#34;Seems like that one&#39;s wedged on tight. Don&#39;t force it and risk hurting yourself-we&#39;ll get someone to help you in a minute.Just leave it for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The so-called event was real enough, but it was carefully staged for one purpose-keeping Millie&#39;s identity under wraps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Brandon and Vivian indeed showed up earlier than expected, the whole setup felt even more convincing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie caught Charles&#39; eye and gave a subtle nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles faced their guests with practiced calm. &#34;So,what brings you both here today? Anything you&#39;d like to get off your chest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s gaze lingered on the frog-suited Millie before she answered. &#34;Actually, we wanted to talk about &#39;Glimmer of Love.&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles motioned for the assistant and the rest of the staff to step out, shutting the door behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot Millie a meaningful look, and then turned to Vivian. &#34;Vivian, our company&#39;s already served you with a legal notice. We&#39;ve warned you multiple times about your infringement, and you chose to ignore it.Frankly, there&#39;s nothing left to negotiate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He delivered the line with the precise cadence he and Millie had rehearsed earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian brushed Charles aside, focusing instead on the silent woman in the oversized frog costume.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eva, what about you?&#34; she asked, her eyes narrowing with a sly glint before shifting to a look of fake concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a soft sigh, voice dripping with affected sympathy. &#34;It can&#39;t be easy, can it? Being a nobody at Evans Entertainment, selling your songs quietly while the company keeps all the spotlight for someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant Vivian finished, Charles and Brandon both turned to her, their reactions sharply opposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s brow knit in silent displeasure, but Charles shot to his feet, his voice sharp with outrage. &#34;Vivian,what the hell are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian offered only a tight, rueful smile, guilt flickering across her face. &#34;I claimed your song as my own. That was wrong of me, and I&#39;m here to make it right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rose and gave a formal, apologetic bow. &#34;Today,I want to settle this once and for all. Brandon and I are prepared to pay you for the right of attribution, so the song will belong solely to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian turned to the Millie still hidden in the frog costume, her expression softening with feigned concern. &#34;You probably could use the money,&#34; she murmured, her smile carrying a note of pity. &#34;Wearing a mascot suit in this heat just to get by-it can&#39;t be easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles bristled, barely containing his rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring him completely, Vivian clasped her hands and leaned in, her tone turning gentle, as if offering a lifeline. &#34;So, why not accept my offer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie kept silent, her face unreadable behind the mascot head. Charles, not missing a beat, raised his voice, flinging accusations at Vivian. &#34;Vivian, you&#39;re unbelievable! Eva, don&#39;t listen to her-those song rights belong to you, and no one can take that away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peering through the mesh of the costume, Millie watched Vivian&#39;s smug little smirk and Brandon&#39;s poker-faced calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She coughed twice, adding a scratchy rasp to her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson, what&#39;s your take on this?&#34; she asked,deliberately sounding hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Brandon&#39;s gaze settled on the mascot. He studied the frog costume, trying to size her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The disguise was nearly perfect; not a single feature gave her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s mind flickered back to the last time he&#39;d run into this woman-her identity just as hidden then..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in that memory, she&#39;d shielded herself with massive sunglasses and a mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remnant of her unfamiliar perfume clung to the present moment, threading through the air between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint line appeared between Brandon&#39;s brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a beat, he spoke, his tone measured. &#34;Legally,the right of attribution belongs to you, and what&#39;s happened is clear-cut infringement. We can end the violation here-but Eva, you have to keep this quiet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s feigned pleasantness fell away, her lips pressing into a thin line as she shot Brandon an aggrieved glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t the plan she&#39;d orchestrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s response was a low, amused laugh. &#34;Is that all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s expression darkened with skepticism as he studied her. &#34;Then what do you propose?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie lowered her gaze, her voice rough with pretense.&#34;My take&#39;s a little different. Just like Miss Simpson mentioned, I need money.&#34; She smiled faintly, her tone gentle. &#34;But I&#39;m not talking about cash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not cash,then resources?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon caught on right away,giving a composed nod.&#34;That&#39;s doable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian, on the other hand, didn&#39;t hide her dissatisfaction. She shot Brandon a pointed look.&#34;Brandon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he paid her no mind, eyes fixed steadily on Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s irritation simmered, though she managed to keep it from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned back to Millie, refusing to back down. &#34;Eva,as long as you keep quiet about this, you&#39;ll get compensated. So why not take more? The result&#39;s the same for you either way. Hand over the right of attribution, work with me, and I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re well compensated.&#34;</p>
