                <p>Soon, Serena&#39;s performance changed again. She was now representing the fifth and final country, Gliphis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing an otherworldly flowing white gown, she stood with quiet poise as she brought the flute to her lips. The tune she played was delicate andbright,each note floating effortlessly through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she set the flute aside and began to sing softly,her voice carried the audience into a breathtaking realm of imagination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the span of her performance, five nations were showcased, each through its own language,instruments, and song. It felt like she took them on a seamless cultural journey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than a series of abrupt, scattered changes in style, the presentation had unfolded smoothly. It was a journey, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like glimpses of rich, ancient cultures threaded into one moving tapestry, blurring time and place in the most beautiful way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Serena brought her final performance to a close, face was hidden in the shadows among the audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He and Millie had visited every country showcased on that stage together, and even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when the Watson Group was beginning its transformation, she had been his constant travel companion, following him from one destination to another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her there, the long days and uncertain nights never felt empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always been a force of light, brimming with energy, and radiating endless hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, we&#39;ll make it,&#34; she used to murmur close to his ear. &#34;No matter what, I&#39;ll stay with you. We&#39;ll climb to the top together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| trust you,&#34; she would say with a bright smile. &#34;So you have to trust me too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s hands curled into tight fists as his thoughts slipped back to that night at the Moonlit Estate. Millie stood there, fragile and tearful, her spirit dimmed like a flower left too long in the cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fists trembled with tension as Serena lowered her instrument and gave a graceful bow to the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon shut his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of applause erupted, loud and unrelenting, like a thunder eruption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was clapping for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just five minutes and thirty seconds, between costume changes and all, Serena had showcased an array of skills to perfection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Technique aside, she displayed her mastery of storytelling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the host stepped onto the stage as the lights turned back on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s give another round of applause to Serena for her wonderful performance!&#34; the host called out, his voice brimming with enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The applause rose again, roaring through the hall like a tempest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host turned to Serena, his eyes gleaming with admiration. &#34;Serena, you never cease to amaze us.After your last performance, Deep Sea,I couldn&#39;t help but wonder what you&#39;d do next, and now I know!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie let out a soft chuckle as she took the microphone. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief interaction, it was time for her to make a final appeal to the audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t perform further. What she had just delivered was already more than enough, and her body was worn out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, everyone, those here with us and those watching from different parts of the world. Today marks the fourth round of Heavenly Melody,and I wouldn&#39;t have made it this far without your support and the hard work of the entire team.&#34; Millie maintained a flawless smile, one that only grew warmer when she caught a glimpse of Vivian&#39;s sour expression on the judging panel. &#34;I&#39;ve heard some unfavorable rumors about me,but I believe that talent speaks louder than baseless rumors. So, please if you loved what you saw, cast your vote for me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she gave another deep bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat mixed with streaks of makeup trickled down her face and fell to the stage floor, shimmering under the lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This conveyed her hard work and sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t need grand words or flowery speeches, just the truth. Millie understood that the audience here wasn&#39;t allowed to use their phones, so they might not know what was going on online right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying too much, or the wrong thing,could easily turn people against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she focused on delivering a message that resonated with both those in the recording studio and those watching online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as she bowed again, waves of thunderous applause filled the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,Millie turned and walked offstage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before disappearing behind the curtains,she glanced at Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s mask of composure had dropped, and she was barely holding back her fury. Her eyes locked on Millie with unmistakable disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie smiled and turned away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host immediately stepped in to keep the show moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, down the staff corridor, Barbara and Charles rushed over to meet her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; Charles asked with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave a tired but bright smile. &#34;Not as drained as you might think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles didn&#39;t look convinced. They all knew how demanding the performance had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara pulled out a pack of tissues in a hurry and began dabbing at Millie&#39;s sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me,&#34; Millie said, taking the tissues from her with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them started walking together, heading toward the far end of the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind them, the crowd&#39;s cheers echoed, alive with enthusiasm and admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie glanced down at the tissue in her hand, now blotched with traces of sweat and makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She loved this feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly after, they arrived at Serena&#39;s dressing room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie sunk into the couch with a sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles approached and handed her a tablet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Barbara passed along your message, and this is the result of their actions,&#34; Charles said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors had flooded the Internet accusing Serena and Charles of rigging the votes. People had questioned Serena&#39;s skill, casting shadows over her rising But now, those voices had gone quiet</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The topic now dominating the trending list was #SerenaAbsoluteTalent</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the face of such raw talent, no rumor stands a chance! I&#39;m blown away. Vote for Serena right now,guys!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are the naysayers now? You cried foul play,but look at this performance! Would someone like Serena even need to cheat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right? I wasn&#39;t even watching this show, but people just couldn&#39;t stop talking and it got me really curious After watching her tonight, I&#39;m completely hooked.Serena is the real deal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s so good that all those fake vote accusations just fall apart on their own!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Five countries, five languages, five songs,instruments, and styles blended so flawlessly. It was breathtaking! Honestly, I wasn&#39;t into the initial part,but now it feels like the perfect choice. If she didn&#39;t have a high vote count, I&#39;d really start suspecting that the competition was rigged!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| agree!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Public opinion had taken a complete turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles glanced over as Millie scrolled through the comments, her expression calm and pleased &#34;Satisfied?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded with a smile.&#34;Very!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But voting is not over yet. There&#39;s still time for them to pull more tricks,&#34; Charles said as he took back the tablet. &#34;We still need to keep our eyes open.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gazed thoughtfully at Vivian who was visible in the live broadcast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no doubt in Millie&#39;s mind, that they hadn&#39;t seen the last of Vivian&#39;s schemes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had already played her hand and there was no chance she&#39;d let Millie off so easily!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Vivian stayed a little longer for the broadcast before retreating into a quieter part of the staff corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, she kept up constant contact with Johnny&#39;s team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to her, a tiny pinhole camera hidden in the corner had been recording everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice, filled with fury, echoed through the small space.&#34;How dare Serena challenge me! Johnny, we&#39;ve got enough dirt to bury her. I want her reputation in ruins!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had previously held back, waiting for Serena to come begging. But now, her patience had run out. She was set on completely tearing her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, a new trending topic hit the Internet &#34;Serena and Charles&#39; Relationship Exposed.&#34;</p>
