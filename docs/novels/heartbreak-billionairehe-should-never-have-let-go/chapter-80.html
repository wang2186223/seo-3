                <p>Previously, these paparazzi had captured only audio recordings, but after landing two major exclusives consecutively,they strategically positioned concealed pinhole cameras in the corridor this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Millie and Vivian had made their way into the staff corridor, their footsteps echoing softly against the polished floors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what&#39;s all this really about?&#34; Millie inquired with characteristic directness, cutting through any pretense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s-eyes darted around the corridor, ensuring no wandering ears could overhear their conversation, before she finally spoke with measured calculation. &#34;Have you reached a decision yet?Will you join forces with me, or shall we remain adversaries?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie found herself puzzled by the cryptic statement. &#34;Collaborate on what specific endeavor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You truly haven&#39;t devoted any consideration to this matter?&#34; Vivian&#39;s laughter carried sharp edges of contempt, though she swiftly suppressed her rising fury upon remembering her underlying agenda.&#34;Allow me to refresh your memory-Millie still stands between you and Charles like an insurmountable wall. If you genuinely desire advancement, you must orchestrate Millie&#39;s downfall. Without that,you&#39;ll never ascend to become Charles&#39;s official girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that revelation, Millie finally comprehended what Vivian was proposing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your proposal holds zero appeal for me,&#34;she responded with unwavering finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having delivered her verdict, Millie pivoted toward the exit with determined purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Vivian materialized directly in her path, transforming herself into an immovable human barricade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you lack enthusiasm for that particular arrangement, what about today&#39;s upcoming competition?&#34;Vivian&#39;s expression transformed into one of supreme confidence, a knowing smile playing across her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie remained silent, her gaze fixed intently on Vivian while she waited for the explanation to unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You understand perfectly well that your live performance quality had been screwed twicealready.These remaining contestants are seasoned professionals, not inexperienced amateurs, and your off-stage voting statistics will inevitably fall short. Since off-stage votes constitute a substantial portion of the final scoring system, you&#39;re already operating from a position of significant disadvantage.Furthermore, several individuals in today&#39;s audience maintain loyalty to my interests, and I myself make scoring decisions as one of the judges,&#34; Vivian declared with calculated precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She advanced closer, her eyes boring into the masked figure who stood before her with steadfast resolve. &#34;Therefore, Serena, do you comprehend the situation now? Whether you advance or face elimination today rests entirely within my control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie studied Vivian&#39;s face and suddenly perceived the entire situation as utterly absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t Vivian proclaimed her desperate desire to spend her remaining six months in peaceful harmony with Brandon? Millie had already released her claim on Brandon and allowed him to pursue his relationship with Vivian, so what purpose did Vivian&#39;s current machinations serve?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie genuinely could not comprehend the logic behind these actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she harbored a personal dislike for Vivian, she had never actively pursued opportunities to sabotage or harm her. When dealing with someone battling such a terminal illness, she perceived no justification in exacerbating their suffering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now, Vivian was deliberately forcing this confrontation upon her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Processing these thoughts, Millie responded with calm resolve, &#34;Proceed however you see fit.I remain completely uninterested in your proposals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie refused to accept the role of a passive victim. She had simply been awaiting the appropriate moment to assert herself. Now that circumstances had shifted favorably in her direction, she felt no inclination to restrain herself any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She began maneuvering around Vivian&#39;s obstructive position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you absolutely certain you have thoroughly considered the consequences of this decision?&#34; Vivian struggled to accept that Millie was still rejecting her proposal outright. &#34;If you refuse to cooperate with my terms, you&#39;ll face elimination in this very round. That outcome means you will become worthless to Charles, and you will never achieve superiorityover Millie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie released a genuine laugh. &#34;Should I interpret that as a direct threat? Or does this represent just another one of your manipulative power games?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If labeling it in those terms provides you with comfort, then certainly,&#34; Vivian replied with icy indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As though the situation could truly be reduced to such simplistic terms. Millie found Vivian&#39;s blatant hypocrisy absolutely astounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than dignifying Vivian&#39;s posturing with additional verbal sparring, Millie simply stepped around her adversary and continued toward her intended destination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Serena!&#34; Vivian&#39;s voice rang out behind her, but Millie maintained her steady pace without so much as a backward glance and walked directly out of the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian could only remain frozen in place, watching Millie&#39;s retreating figure disappear, her jaw muscles clenched so tightly that sharp pain shot through her temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She despised this infuriating woman with every fiber of her being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She possessed undeniable leverage over Serena, yet the masked contestant remained frustratingly indifferent to every threat and manipulation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she didn&#39;t require someone to execute her underhanded schemes at this moment, she would have orchestrated Serena&#39;s destruction ages ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will come crawling back to me on your hands and knees one day,&#34; Vivian whispered through gritted teeth, her words dripping with promised retribution. &#34;Just wait until you&#39;re truly desperate and hanging by a thread.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still retained the powerful option to resurrect an eliminated contestant from the competition, and she found herself anticipating the moment when Serena would grovel and plead for her intervention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embracing this satisfying thought, Vivian finally allowed her tense muscles to relax, curved her lips into a triumphant smile, and glided out through the staff corridor with renewed confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After both women had departed from the corridor, two shadowy figures began conversing in hushed tones within a cramped, dimly lit surveillance room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our boss truly possesses an extraordinary instinct for explosive drama. This footage will generate massive headlines!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;During our last assignment, when the boss instructed us to maintain surveillance on Brandon&#39;s wife,we stumbled upon that incredible scene of a child addressing her as &#39;mom&#39;-that single shot netted us a substantial fortune!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This ammunition will prove devastatingly effective for extorting substantial payments from Vivian.She&#39;ll hemorrhage cash to keep this buried!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely correct. This behavior contradicts her carefully crafted public persona completely. If she refuses our demands, her sterling reputation will crumble into worthless dust!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.··</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While everyone harbored their own sinister machinations and hidden agendas, the third live show commenced with great fanfare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trinity of judges assumed their elevated positions one by one, each movement choreographed for maximum dramatic impact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The charismatic host emerged into the blazing spotlight, delivering polished introductions for each distinguished panel member, who responded with carefully rehearsed pleasantries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the spotlight shifted to illuminate Vivian&#39;s moment of prominence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One could argue that this particular season of Heavenly Melody had achieved such unprecedented widespread attention largely through Vivian&#39;s magnetic presence and star power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Backstage, Millie stood in perfect stillness, her sharp gaze fixed intently upon Vivian&#39;s commanding performance on the illuminated stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clutched her phone firmly, methodically reviewing a private group chat that tracked everyone&#39;s assigned tasks and responsibilities for the evening&#39;s live broadcast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone had completed their preparations with thoroughness and dedication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How swiftly time passes by us. This evening already marks the third electrifying live stage for our beloved Heavenly Melody competition,&#34; Vivian declared with a radiant smile, her presence absolutely</p>
                
                
                
                <p>luminous beneath the stage lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At this moment, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to every single audience member who has remained steadfast in their support, accompanying me through this incredible journey of discovery and artistic growth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s smile deepened with apparent sincerity as the live camera smoothly panned across the audience to capture Brandon&#39;s supportive face among the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd exploded into thunderous applause that reverberated throughout the entire venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing within earshot, Barbara offered her astute observation, &#34;Mr. Watson has maintained his attendance for all three live shows without missing a single performance. He must genuinely harbor deep affection and concern for Vivian&#39;s success.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie remained perfectly still, her expression carved from marble as she absorbed the spectacle with detached composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the enthusiastic cheers gradually subsided into expectant silence, the camera swept away and then captured the Elliott brothers seated among the sea of faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Elliott brothers have graced us with their presence as well!&#34; Barbara exclaimed with genuine surprise. &#34;Isn&#39;t Myron famously elusive? Yet here he stands, having attended two performances already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s brow furrowed slightly as she recalled Jayceon&#39;s unbridled excitement when he had requested an and autograph during their previous encounter. &#34;Their bond appears unshakeable. Perhaps he&#39;s simply here to champion his younger brother&#39;s endeavors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara&#39;s head bobbed in understanding agreement. &#34;That reasoning holds perfect sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The camera continued its sweeping journey, capturing devoted audience members brandishing handmade signs bearing Vivian&#39;s name in bold, colorful letters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s eyes narrowed into calculating slits as recognition dawned-these were undoubtedly the very people Vivian had spoken of, the ones capable of manipulating the live voting results through sheer vocal force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In harsh reality, live audiences rarely maintained complete objectivity in their judgments. Most attendees inevitably developed personal favorites and preferences. That fundamental reason explained why online voting carried significantly heavierweight in the final scoring calculations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing inherently flawed existed within the established scoring system itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Millie had consistently found herself swimming upstream against the current because of her feed&#39;s inferior production values, which paled in comparison to her competitors&#39; polished presentations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, the first two competitive rounds had served primarily as introductory showcases and had not resulted in massive contestant eliminations, which allowed Millie to successfully advance through those preliminary stages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet given the carefully orchestrated circumstances surrounding this particular round, Vivian&#39;s behind-the-scenes manipulation had become glaringly transparent and undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This round,however, would unfold according to an entirely different script.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you from the depths of my heart,&#34; Vivian whispered, pressing delicate fingertips beneath her glistening eyes before gracefully lowering herself into her designated seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that carefully choreographed moment of sentiment, the competition officially commenced with renewed intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Contestants took the stage one after another, each determined to etch their mark into the evening&#39;s memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stakes had escalated dramatically-five souls would face elimination while one fortunate performer would earn resurrection, driving every participant to pour their entire essence into their fleeting moment under the blazing lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At long last, fate called Millie&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adorned in a breathtaking mermaid gown that caught and scattered light like captured starlight, Millie glided onto the stage with measured, hypnotic grace.</p>
