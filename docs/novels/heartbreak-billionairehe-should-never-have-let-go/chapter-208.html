                <p>Egbert stood on the ground below, glaring up as the hot air balloon drifted higher. Frustration burned in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could do nothing but watch it rise beyond his reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the balloon, Millie looked out over the island, watching it slowly unfold beneath her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she saw what Myron had prepared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire island shimmered with lights, arranged to form one glowing word-&#34;Millie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow,&#34; she whispered, staring as the island grew smaller below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned toward Myron, who stood beside her,his hands now off the controls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still wore a half-face mask. His gaze stayed fixed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why go to such lengths?&#34; she asked quietly. &#34;Am I really worth it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood her doubts. He knew her fears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being with her might even mean a future without their own children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could have chosen someone else. Someone healthier and stronger. Someone with a simpler background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of answering her questions, he opened a nearby box and took out a necklace</p>
                
                
                
                <p>with a heart-shaped blue diamond pendant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because of this,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milie stared at the pendant. Memories rushed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you remember?&#34; he asked, meeting her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly,he removed his mask. There was a trace of sadness in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie,&#34; he said, his voice low. &#34;I&#39;ve waited for you. It feels like forever. After all these years, I can finally return this to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories came flooding back. She remembered it all, the events from years past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been a child when her father, James, took her to Mirough. He showed her the empire he had built.They traveled together, and she saw his influence everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the time, James stood at the peak of his power. Millie, his only daughter, was welcomed wherever she went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they arrived in Mirough, people flooded in with gifts, seeking favors. But she had already grown tired of that kind of attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know then that, within a year, her father would fall from a tall building and leave her forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did know something though-people only valued her because of who her father was. One word from him could change a person&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her father&#39;s permission, Millie visited the port, guarded by bodyguards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;was just a teenager thenMyron said. &#34;My family had sent me out to the sea to handle shipping. We met at the port.&#34; He paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My father had failed in a family power struggle. He was supposed to fixit, but he died. My mother had to raise my younger siblings, and I took over. The sea is chaotic. Once you&#39;re out in uncharted waters, people vanish without explanation. Men disappear, thrown overboard. I was too young. My crew barely respected me. Just staying alive was hard. I couldn&#39;t even think about exploring new territory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,he smiled. &#34;And then I met you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You gave me this. You told me to seek help from the Bennett family&#39;s men.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned the pendant, showing her the name &#34;Bennett&#34; etched in an ancient, totem-like script.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With this, I found the Bennett family. I actually met your father that same day. I received help from both of you. Within a year,I managed to gather my crew and take control. I was on the sea pretty much all year around, and I only heard the news of your father&#39;s death almost a year later. I wanted to do something but there wasn&#39;t much I could do. And then I realized-I still wasn&#39;t strong enough to find the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The balloon floated gently in the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stared at the necklace. She had never imagined the boy she once met would one day stand before her like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, she hadn&#39;t thought much of it. She only wanted to help a struggling young man from the same homeland, speaking the same language.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out and held the pendant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron noticed the emotion in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been just kids and their meeting had been brief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her,it was a small gesture of kindness. To him, it was everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, he saw her and James as his saviors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been powerless. But he made himself a promise-he would become strong, and he would learn the truth behind James&#39; death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, betrayal brought them together again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the bullet that should have killed him led him to her instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I returned,&#34; he said,&#34;you were already with Brandon. Married, even. I kept digging into your father&#39;s death, but the truth kept slipoping away. I noticed a hidden force behind everything, and I couldn&#39;t get past it.I had to wait for the right moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many had tried to uncover James&#39; death throughout the years. Although Myron had been one of them,he  couldn&#39;t risk exposing his link to the Bennett family. That would only bring more danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now,he confessed his love only in the stillness of the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had believed that Brandon loved Millie and treated her well, that she would be safe with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Myron buried his feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, Brandon had let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, it was his turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would love her fully. Without fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single tear fell from Millie&#39;s cheek, landing on the blue diamond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at the pendant in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After her father&#39;s death and the fall of the Bennett family, she had almost nothing left from her past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was one of the treasures he once gifted her, which made it extremely special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t cry,&#34; Myron said. He reached out, removed her mask, and gently wiped her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cupped her face, looking into her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me, Millie,&#34; he said. &#34;We&#39;ll find the truth. We&#39;ll bring the Bennett family back. It&#39;s only a matter of time.Just trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at him,overwhelmed by emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,softly, she asked, &#34;Will you help me put it on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; he said, taking the necklace from her and fastening it around her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gemstone settled against her skin, steady and warm. It felt like another heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we going now?&#34; she asked. &#34;To relive the moments when I loved you,&#34; Myron said. &#34;I want you to know-my love for you isn&#39;t gratitude.t isn&#39;t a way to prove anything. I love you, Millie. Truly. Simply because I love you.&#34;</p>
