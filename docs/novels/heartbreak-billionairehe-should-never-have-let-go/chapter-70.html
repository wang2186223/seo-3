                <p>Babette paused on purpose, her gaze searching Millie&#39;s face. &#34;Millie, even with all this talk swirling around,do you plan on seeing him again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon cut in, his brow tightening, &#34;That&#39;s enough,Babette. Let&#39;s leave it at that. I know the truth-Millie has no connection to that man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of annoyance flashed across Babette&#39;s features. &#34;Brandon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby,Casimir-recently scolded-remained silent,watching the exchange with a faint,knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Watson family had grown massive over the years,with dozens of new faces in every branch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, the turnout was impressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Brandon and Millie always in the spotlight,their presence naturally drew a crowd. As they lingered near the entrance, more and more family members drifted over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the newcomers were cousins and younger relatives-some close, some from more distant branches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elders, meanwhile, had retreated upstairs, sipping their drinks and making small talk as if none of this concerned them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie wasn&#39;t fooled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air was thick with hidden agendas-today&#39;s family gathering was anything but casual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the whispers, pointed questions from Babette, and Casimir&#39;s subtle digs? The older generation had orchestrated it all, allowing-and perhaps even encouraging-this quiet interrogation, thanks to the child she&#39;d suddenly been photographed wvith.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening, Brandon. Good evening, Millie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A group of cousins drifted over, smiles and greetings mingling as they arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few of them had spouses in tow, their numbers swelling the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With new faces gathering, Millie decided it was time to clear the air. &#34;Honestly, there&#39;s no real mystery,&#34; she said. &#34;Like Babette said, Watson Group broke new ground first-that was the real victory. Mr. Perez had resources and connections we needed to move forward,and our deal with him was about lifting a blockade, nothing more. As for the so-called wager...&#34;Millie&#39;s voice softened as she glanced down. &#34;There was a bet, but it was just a bit of fun on Mr. Perez&#39;s part. It didn&#39;t influence the partnership in any meaningful way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon studied Millie, his gaze lingering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of Flesta flickered through his mind. In those ten short minutes he&#39;d been called away, he never found out what passed between Millie and Egbert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He only left to sign the deal. When he returned,all he saw was Millie plunging into icy cold water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock of cold blue,the blood, and the child they lost left a scar that never faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not once, in all the years since, had they dared speak of that night again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last thing he ever wanted was to watch her break down in tears like that again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s all there is?&#34; Babette asked, still looking for holes in the story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s everything,&#34; Brandon answered before Millie could, his voice firm. &#34;You&#39;re wrong about her,Babette. She isn&#39;t the person you&#39;re making her out to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he took MMillie&#39;s hand and led her away from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette remained rooted to the spot, fists balled in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casimir swirled his wine, a smirk curling at the corner of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feeling left out?&#34; Casimir&#39;s tone was light but needling. &#34;You always got along best with Brandon.But now, you put him in the middle and wound up pushed aside. Tough break, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette shot him a glare, retorting, &#34;WVhy don&#39;t you stay out of it for once?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brandon and Millie slipped away, Millie couldn&#39;t help but replay Babette&#39;s pointed words in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One question echoed above the rest-Babette&#39;s casual remark-&#34;Millie, have you heard the latest?Word is, Mr. Perez is making his trip to Crobert.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow creased with unease, fingers tightening around the stem of her glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Derek&#39;s message that he wouldn&#39;t be joining them for dinner, the entire family soon found themselves seated along a sprawling dining table, the evening carrying on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As always, Millie took her seat right beside Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around them, the dinner table buzzed with chatter,silverware chiming and glasses raised in constant toasts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through the meal, one of the elders steered the conversation toward the child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie braced herself, half expecting Brandon to join in and question her, but to her surprise, he skillfully sidestepped the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave nothing away except, &#34;We&#39;ll address that issue for everyone in detail another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Brandon setting the tone, nobody dared press further,limiting themselves to a few indirect, cautious hints.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stealing a glance at Brandon,Millie watched him serve her more food, his expression steady and composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet realization dawned on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite Brandon&#39;s command over the Watson family,conflicts bubbled beneath the surface-alliances shifting, loyalties uncertain. Tonight, as their marriage still appeared intact to the public, he chose to protect her-he had to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had done the same earlier, both when Babette brought up the past and just now, when an elder pried about the child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time they entered the dining hall, they&#39;d both left their coats at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s gaze lingered on her, noting the loose sleeves and pants. Even in clothing that concealed her frame, her recent weight loss was impossible to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shivered more often these days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon looked at her and murmured, &#34;Have some more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dinner seemed to slip by in no time at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casimir tried digging for information here and there but came up empty every time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the family had no better luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden vibration interrupted the flow-Brandon checked his phone and saw Derek&#39;s name flashing across the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood and stepped aside to take the call,leaving Millie at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette seized the moment, drifting over to Millie once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She plucked a glass of white wine from a passing tray and offered it with a sly tilt of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What,is the wine not up to your standards?&#34; Babette teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying nothing,Millie accepted the glass, brought it to her nose, and inhaled the bouquet. The aroma confirmed it-a high-quality vintage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let a small sip linger on her tongue and savored the taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette watched, and then said, &#34;Have another taste.I picked this up in Flesta-it wasn&#39;t easy to get, and it definitely wasn&#39;t cheap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a glint in her eye, she added, &#34;It&#39;s also...rather special.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That comment drew Millie&#39;s gaze upward, eyes narrowing slightly in curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette only grinned. &#34;Relax. There&#39;s nothing in it but wine,&#34; she said, a quick laugh escaping her. &#34;Brandon&#39;s nearby-I wouldn&#39;t dare try anything foolish.&#34; Fixing her gaze on Millie, Babette murmured, &#34;I&#39;m only curious if you can pick out what makes this wine stand out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A puzzled look crossed Millie&#39;s face as she took another careful sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her efforts, nothing beyond the wine&#39;s obvious excellence stood out to her palate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t tell.&#34; A quiet apology escaped her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette let out a light, almost mischievous laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you really haven&#39;t a clue,&#34; Babette teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion swept over Millie. Babette&#39;s attitude tonight made no sense, and neither did her cryptic comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If there&#39;s something I should know, just tell me,&#34;Millie replied quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette only offered a mysterious shake of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she gestured again, inviting Millie to try the wine once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having already finished one glass, Millie waved off the offer. &#34;I should stop-still need to see Derek later tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Babette simply nodded her acceptance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pleasant smile lingered as she added, &#34;I&#39;ll be throwing a wine tasting soon to celebrate my return.You and Brandon should make an appearance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That invitation lingered in Millie&#39;s mind. Despite the ongoing divorce proceedings, she recognized the importance of showing up in public with Brandon before the divorce was finalized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Brandon returned, slipping his phone away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, he went to get Millie&#39;s coat and wrapped it gently around her shoulders. He offered Babette a brief nod, and then led Millie away from the gathering</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night air rolling off the lake cut straight through them,sharp and chilly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shudder passed through Millie as the cold found her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the wine swirling in her head and the breeze pressing against her, dizziness crept in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s low voice broke through her haze &#34;Grandma just called-Grandpa&#39;s already asleep, so we won&#39;t see him tonight. She wants us to stay and visit in the morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie could only nod, her mind a fog. Her footing faltered, and she nearly stumbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon caught her quickly, his arm steadying her before she could fall.</p>
