                <p>Millie kept a close eye on Ari as she carried on her phone conversation with Rita.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Softly, she remarked, &#34;Dr. Carpenter, I&#39;ve noticed lately that my symptoms have evened out quite a bit.&#34;Memories of Ari and Myron drawing his cat together the night before drifted through her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe it&#39;s timne I let myself consider new opportunities.&#34; A wistful tone entered her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, the line went quiet, which Millie found a little strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in her office at the facility, Rita heard a gentle knock at the door. Brandon stood there,accompanied by Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita, the physician responsible for Millie&#39;s care, was already familiar with the history between her patient and Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also,given Brandon&#39;s reputation in Crobert, she knew who he was,of course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity piqued, she wondered what had brought both Brandon and Vivian to her door today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After pondering for a second, Rita returned her attention to the call. &#34;Something urgent has come up. Mind if I call you back later?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving it much thought, Millie agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, Rita focused on her unexpected visitors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can I help you both?&#34; she inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight crease formed on Brandon&#39;s brow. Hadn&#39;t he made sure they had the right appointment scheduled?Why did this woman seem completely clueless?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian opened her mouth to clarify, but a flurry of footsteps down the hallway cut her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An apologetic voice sounded as a staff member hurried over. &#34;Excuse me for the mix-up. It looks like you received the wrong appointment slip. Here&#39;s the right one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a quick exchange of paperwork, things made sense to Brandon at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry about that.&#34; The staff member dipped his head in apology, including Rita in his gesture, before Brandon guided Vivian toward the proper office just next door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out in the hallway, Rita paused to meet the staff member&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh escaped him as he said, &#34;The new hire messed up again. He can&#39;t even handle handing out slips and pointing to the right office. Honestly, I&#39;m at my wits&#39; end. I keep having to sort out his errors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile spread across Rita&#39;s face. &#34;Everyone needs time to learn. Let&#39;s be patient with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking his head, the staff member replied, &#34;That&#39;s not going to cut it! I need to report this and see if he can be moved somewhere less important. I can&#39;t keep covering for him.&#34; He finished before darting away down the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita followed his retreat with her gaze before letting her attention drift back to the office next door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the adjacent room, Brandon sat with Vivian as the doctor began the evaluation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Self-inflicted wounds already marked Vivian&#39;s struggle, a sign of just how grave her depression had become.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Medication and the right course of therapy were no longer optional for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry etched deeper lines across Brandon&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick,loaded glance passed between Vivian and the physician.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the night before had she pressed Oakley for details about this particular facility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the facility prided itself on ironclad discretion, private ownership allowed for certain test results to be conveniently adjusted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley had made sure this specific doctor would be overseeing Vivian&#39;s case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one could downplay the seriousness of her situation, considering both the self-harm and her stomach cancer diagnosis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to put Brandon at ease, Vivian squeezed his hand and mustered a shaky smile. &#34;You don&#39;t need to worry about me,&#34; she insisted. &#34;Honestly, I&#39;m already at the point where...&#34; Her words faded, and the concern in Brandon&#39;s eyes only deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With hope for answers, he turned toward the doctor.there any alternative treatment you&#39;d recommend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what was suggested, it was clear Vivian wouldn&#39;t consider taking medication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle sigh escaped the doctor before he spoke. &#34;I&#39;ll see what I can do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the assessment wrapped up, Brandon asked Vivian if she could step into the hallway for a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the quiet office, he faced the doctor with a question.there any way she can manage this without medication?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shake of the head came in response. &#34;We&#39;re talking about depression here, Mr. Watson..And when it comes to cases as severe as hers, medication is a must for stabilization.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s eyes dropped to the floor as he considered the gravity of the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their conversation turned to a few other important topics until, at last, the doctor added, &#34;I&#39;ll discuss this with my colleagues and prepare a detailed report along with a treatment plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nod from Brandon signaled his understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could you leave a mailing address?&#34; the doctor continued. &#34;To ensure confidentiality, we avoid using online systemns. The full report will be sent as a hard copy to the location you specify.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Accepting the precaution, Brandon gave the address for his apartment neighboring the Watson Group offices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the details settled, Brandon walked out into the hall and looked over at Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s time to go,&#34; he said, gently guiding her out of the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her desk, Rita kept a low profile, quietly witnessing everything that unfolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At no point did she press for information about Vivian&#39;s health; instead, she contented herself with silent observation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just when she assumed the hall had cleared out, and her hand reached for her office door, Vivian reappeared on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight frown touched Rita&#39;s lips, the odd timing not lost on her, yet she remained calm, never letting on that anything was amiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, the neighboring office door sat partly open, and snatches of Vivian&#39;s words drifted through the gap. &#34;Yes... That&#39;s it... Please update it to my address... Vivian Floral Design...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More words followed, blurred by distance, until V/ivian left the office and departed down the corridor in a hurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicion nagged at Rita, the situation not quite adding up, but the details stayed just out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Professional instincts kept her from voicing any of her concerns, though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Rita figured she needed to speak with her colleague to coordinate the schedule so Millie wouldn&#39;t bump into Brandon or Vivian should she visit next time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out in the parking lot, Brandon sat behind the wheel, waiting while Vivian ducked inside the building,mentioning she needed a quick stop at the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With nothing else to do, he lazily scrolled through his phone,killing time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unexpected tidbit of gossip flashed across his screen. Darden&#39;s name appeared-this time with a voice message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement charged through Darden&#39;s words. &#34;Big news on the grapevine! The Elliott heir, Myron,has been busy-drone and firework displays, candlelit dinners, lavish gifts, cruise getaways, you name it. Sounds like he&#39;s gearing up for an engagement and possibly even a marriage alliance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing that, Brandon&#39;s thoughts drifted to the conversation he&#39;d overheard at the Heavenly Melody finals between Myron, Jayceon, and Adriana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From what he learnt that night, it was clear Myron meant to move forward with something significant.He remembered catching that the woman in question hadn&#39;t agreed to anything just yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given Darden&#39;s report about all the over-the-top plans, Myron seemed determined to win her over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the situation replayed in his mind, Brandon typed out a message-&#34;Which family is Myron targeting for this marriage alliance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A powerhouse like Elliott Group-one of Crobert&#39;s biggest-would turn any alliance into headline news, and such a move could change the business landscape for both families.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A response from Darden came quickly. &#34;Beats me. The Elliotts are playing things close to the vest. Not even Jayceon could slip up and say a word, so we&#39;ll just have to wait for the reveal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint frown flickered across Brandon&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A burst of voices suddenly drew his attention-an argument had broken out at the reception, though he couldn&#39;t tell what sparked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, Vivian-made her way back to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hope I didn&#39;t keep you waiting, Brandon.&#34; She offered an apologetic smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting his phone aside, Brandon turned the ignition and eased the car out of the lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, inside Crobert Hospital, Giffard strolled through a quiet corridor and caught snatches of a conversation as he passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,you heard me-Vivian Simpson. There&#39;s something off about her,&#34;someone remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion lingered in another voice. &#34;Seriously, I don&#39;t get why she&#39;d go about her treatment this way. None &#34;Yeah, you heard me-Vivian Simpson. There&#39;s something off about hsomeone remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion lingered in another voice. &#34;Seriously, I don&#39;t get why she&#39;d go about her treatment this way.None of it adds up.&#34;</p>
