                <p>Myron&#39;s hand was smeared with tears and blood as he held on to Brandon, who stood there, looking completely broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden was shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had known Brandon since they were boys, and Brandon had always been the one who led their circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brilliant and capable, Brandon had steered the Watson Group through a flawless transformation,raising it to the top of Crobert&#39;s three giants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Darden, Brandon was as solid as a granite wall against a raging storm. He had always carried himself with authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never seen Brandon cry before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden&#39;s eyes darted around, catching sight of</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never imagined that the ever-smiling, gentle,seemingly refined Myron could carry such menace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look Myron had given him earlier had sent a genuine chill down his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That gentle attitude had been nothing but an act!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron made his move without the slightest hesitation when he had to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had happened? How had it all come to this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, Darden glanced toward the car parked in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this because of Millie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he wrestled with the thought, Myron gave a cold mirthless laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, do you really think a few words and some tears will make me hand her back to you? You must be out of your mind.&#34; Myron&#39;s voice was cold. &#34;Also,she&#39;s not some trinket to be claimed. You never</p>
                
                
                
                <p>respected her, Brandon. You never cared about what she felt, about her sadness or her happiness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon swallowed down his grief, raising his face to look at Myron. &#34;What if she says she loves me? That she wants to be with me? Would you let her be with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two men stared at each other, and the parking lot fell into a tense, heavy silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Myron spoke. &#34;Hasn&#39;t it been that way all these years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s heart had once belonged to Brandon, and for that reason, Myron had been content to just quietly protect her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remained in the background, never interfering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He only wanted her happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But over time, he saw the truth. Millie wasn&#39;t happy She was often in tears, and he could no longer bear to watch her suffer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon was speechless, lowering his face as if a memory had been awaken in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw that photo, from Eldoria... years ago,&#34; he said at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron gave a small laugh. &#34;It all began even earlier than that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; Brandon whispered. At this, Darden glared at Brandon in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron didn&#39;t respond. He simply stared at Brandon,his eyes cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brandon looked up again, he saw the determination in Myron&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon understood at once the silent response-Myron would never let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave a low, bitter laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know how it had come to this, how everything had spun out of his control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, he could do nothing to change it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| won&#39;t let her go,&#34; Brandon muttered. Blood and tears streaked down his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myron, I will not let go!&#34; he repeated himself fiercely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s eyes stayed cold as he looked at the man before him. At last, he released Brandon&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let go of Darden, drew a handkerchief from his pocket, wiped his palm, and tossed it toward Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whether you let go or not doesn&#39;t matter,&#34; Myron said. &#34;You should understand that she&#39;s my girlfriend now...No-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, and then continued, &#34;Millie is my fiancee.She&#39;s accepted my proposal. She wears my ring.We&#39;ll live together, get married, have children, and grow old side by side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s eyes swept over Brandon, his expression filled with contempt. &#34;As for you...you can keep living with Vivian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was more Myron could have said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s treatment of Millie was far from settled, and he already had plans in motion. But Brandon didn&#39;t need to know them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,Myron glanced at Darden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden quickly stepped aside, knowing better than to get in his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron turned and walked towards the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden rushed to steady Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both looked up just in time to see Myron lift Millie gently from the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stirred faintly at his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we?&#34; she asked, her voice drowsy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The parking lot,&#34; Myron replied with a gentle smile softening his face. With his free hand, he shut the car door. &#34;It&#39;s alright. Go back to sleep. I&#39;ll carry you upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm...&#34; Millie purred, wrapping her arms around his neck and resting her head against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding her close, Myron turned to give Brandon and Darden one last look before stepping into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s chest burned with anger, his eyes fixed on them with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden let out a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, let&#39;s get you cleaned up,&#34; he said gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon shook his head. He wasn&#39;t going anywhere; he needed to see Millie and explain things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way he could wait another moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could move, his phone rang with a call from Eugene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon frowned.He knew Eugene was with Vivian,and he felt an instant wave of reluctance at the mere thought of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson, something&#39;s wrong...&#34; Eugene&#39;s voice held hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Brandon asked, wiping at the grime on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Simpson had another depressive episode and cut her wrist again,&#34; Eugene said with a weary sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m at the same sanatorium as before. I know you&#39;re busy, and I didn&#39;t want to reach out. But she said...&#34;Eugene swallowed nervously, and then said, &#34;She said if you don&#39;t come, she&#39;ll end things and take the secret from a year ago to her grave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden, listening from nearby, instantly caught the meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a threat!&#34; he snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day&#39;s events had already soured his opinion of Vivian. He had let her use his villa for her streaming,and now she was repaying him with endless trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even suspected she was behind the damage to his water pipes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon,&#34; Darden said, teeth clenched, &#34;you can&#39;t let her keep pulling you around just because she cut her wrist. You need to figure out how she even got into your house. Besides, my place is still flooded.&#34;There was a hint of frustration in Darden&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon tightened his grip on the tissue in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes drifted toward the elevator, as if willing them to pierce the walls and reach Myron and Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson?&#34; Eugene called anxiously from the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see,&#34; Brandon said at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s mess would have to be dealt with first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Depression?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon let out a humorless laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After overhearing Vivian&#39;s doctor&#39;s call last time, he had looked into the man and uncovered proof of their conspiracy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had chosen not to expose her then, sparing her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>feelings. But now, she was using the same trick again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And there was still the question of how she had entered Serenity Villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With these issues in mind, Brandon climbed into the car with Darden, and they drove off toward the sanatorium.</p>
