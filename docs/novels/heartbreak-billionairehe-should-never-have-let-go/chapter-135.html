                <p>Chapter on her marriage, and that was something worth celebrating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>·.·</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Brandon had already returned to the Watson Group&#39;s headquarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ordered Eugene the day before to clear his calendar. So when Eugene spotted him walking in,he was genuinely taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson, what brings you back?&#34; Eugene asked,eyeing him with barely concealed worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t look so good. Should I call a doctor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon brushed him off with a dismissive wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need. Go ahead and get ready. We&#39;ll go on with those meetings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene opened his mouth, hesitating, almost asking about the divorce, but Brandon&#39;s expression left no room for questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; Eugene said at once, moving quickly to carry out the order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon endured back-to-back meetings all morning,a storm cloud shadowing his every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one dared cross him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After each session, the employees would scatter,their voices dropping to urgent whispers behind closed doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see Mr. Watson today? The secretary&#39;s office said he&#39;d canceled all his schedules and taken the day off-so why is he back here, looking like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I noticed. Typically, Mr. Watson is very particular about his appearance. He&#39;s never shown up unshaven before. And did you see the wrinkles in his shirt? Something must have happened. He looks exhausted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe he had another fight with Vivian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who can say? All I know is, when Mrs. Watson was still around, he was never this out of sorts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cut the damn nonsense!&#34; Eugene shut down their whispering with a warning glance. &#34;Don&#39;t start rumors about Mr. Watson, unless you want to lose your jobs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd fell silent, muttering apologies before slipping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of sight, Brandon pressed his lips together, a faint line of tension crossing his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lingered in the shadows for a moment longer, and then turned away, his footsteps echoing quietly down the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The morning had been relentless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon, running on fumes after a sleepless night,felt fatigue clawing at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slumped back into his leather chair, hoping for a brief reprieve. Just then, the office door swung open,breaking the quiet. Footsteps approached, brisk and deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon,&#34; a familiar voice called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked awake to find Vivian standing in front of him, her lips curled into a bright, almost triumphant smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go get married,&#34; Vivian announced, her tone light but unmistakably bold.</p>
