                <p>Chapter will finally be behind me,&#34; she whispered, clutching her phone a little tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a hectic morning, Brandon finally settled in for lunch, loosening his tie as he took a seat at the dining table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he looked down to see what he was having,the savory aroma of beef stew wafted up from a steaming bowl placed before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, one brow arching in mild surprise, and then glanced over at Eugene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rubbing the back of his neck, Eugene offered an awkward smile. &#34;Mr. Watson, you didn&#39;t seem pleased  with that beef stew from the restaurant the other night, so I brought my mom&#39;s homemade stew for you She swears it&#39;s her best dish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon merely inclined his head in acknowledgment,saying nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft knock broke the brief silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s gaze shifted toward the doorway, where Vivian lingered, her figure framed by the light spilling in fromn the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped inside, momentarily caught off guard when she spotted the stew gracing Brandon&#39;s table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene straightened up, curiosity flickering in his eyes.&#34;Is there something you need, Miss Simpson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian flashed Eugene a warm smile. &#34;I brought the same dish for Brandon. I heard he hasn&#39;t found a single restaurant in Crobert that serves decent beef stew, so I cooked this myself. Go on,Brandon, give it a try. Let me know what you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene kept quiet, casting a sidelong glance at Brandon for any hint of reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon, composed as ever, accepted the container from Vivian, set it neatly on the table, and sampled the beef stew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well?&#34; Vivian leaned forward, her eyes shining with anticipation. &#34;Do you like it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon took his time, savoring the flavor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stew was perfectly fine-pleasant enough, but it still fell short of Millie&#39;s unmistakable touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stil, he replied with a nod,&#34;It&#39;s good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s face lit up with satisfaction. She nudged the container closer and coaxed him to eat a little more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance flickered across Brandon&#39;s face as he sent Vivian out on an errand, eager for a moment of peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, a knock sounded at the door-another lunch delivery, this one from Watson Mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted the lid to discover, unsurprisingly,a steaming beef stew and a folded note tucked neatly beside it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, his grandfather&#39;s bold script sprawled across the page. &#34;Heard about your beef stew hunting mission. Brandon, you&#39;re missing Millie, aren&#39;t you?Bring her home. There&#39;s nothing a real conversation can&#39;t fix. We&#39;re family. That&#39;s what matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reading those words, Brandon&#39;s chest tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the date loomed large in his mind-the last day before their divorce was finalized.</p>
