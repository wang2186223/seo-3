                <p>Brandon suddenly remembered his promise to Vivian -they were supposed to have dinner together tonight. So he responded, &#34;I&#39;ll be a bit late. I&#39;m having dinner with Vivian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden replied immediately, &#34;Alright, alright, your Vivian comes first. Anyway, I&#39;ll book a private room at the Blue Lounge and wait for you. Let&#39;s celebrate your first day of freedom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Brandon said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after ending the call, another thought crept into his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was Millie doing on their first day apart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He checked the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, she&#39;d likely picked up Ari from school. She&#39;d take her back to her apartment and cook dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What would they be eating?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The beef stew Ari like?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought brought a small smile to his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without realizing it, Brandon pressed the intercom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Eugene entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson,&#34; he greeted politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon tapped his fingers on the desk. &#34;Check the partnership terms with Magic Cartoon and order.some of their merchandise. For research.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene opened his mouth to ask a question, but reconsidered and simply said, &#34;UJnderstood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once we&#39;ve reviewed the items, send them to Ari&#39;s kindergarten,&#34; Brandon added. &#34;Is that clear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Mr. Watson. Distributing them to all the children will be the best approach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave a faint nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari wouldn&#39;t accept gifts from him directly. This was the only way he could give her something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still a bit dazed, Brandon thought back to how quickly the marriage had unraveled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had expected Millie to cry, to resist the divorce,maybe even refuse to sign the papers at first. But none of that happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scrolled through their chat history. The last messages were still his-left on read, unanswered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled what he&#39;d asked her last night-&#34;Do you love me?&#34; And she had given a positive answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So was she simply being mature, or was she just being stubborn,pretending she didn&#39;t care?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Millie had already picked up Ari and brought her home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were having dinner together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Vivian arrived to meet Brandon at the restaurant, Millie was bathing Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brandon and Vivian sat down for their meal, Millie finished getting Ari ready, buckled her into the car seat,and drove her to the children&#39;s home</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she returned home, parked the car, and took a taxi to the Blue Lounge. She might be drinking tonight, and it wasn&#39;t safe to drive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she had Ari to look after, Millie arrived a little late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she opened the door to the private room, she was greeted by the sight of Alexia singing and dancing wildly, startling her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Near her, Giffard stood with a deep frown, clearly at his wit&#39;s end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, you&#39;re finally here!&#34; Alexia said, stopping mid-song and beaming as she walked over. She grabbed a few handsome strangers and pushed them toward Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here you go. Your order of eye candy has arrived!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she said with a mischievous grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie blinked,completely confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles, standing nearby, was equally dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexia...&#34; Millie tried to speak, but Alexia pinched her arm and leaned in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought Giffard wouldn&#39;t show up. He was supposed to be on night duty. But he switched shifts at the last minute. Please, help me out, or I&#39;m dead meat!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexia!&#34; Giffard snapped, &#34;You&#39;re whisperinginto a microphone. Do you think I&#39;m deaf?&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m doomed, Millie!&#34; Alexia wailed theatrically.&#34;This is the end!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie couldn&#39;t help but laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a character!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giffard chased his sister around the room while Seville took over the microphone and got the crowd hyped up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheridan couldn&#39;t make it tonight, so Seville offered his apologies on his behalf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Charles walked over to Millie and poured her a drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, how&#39;s your first day post-divorce?&#34; he asked with a light smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie took the glass and downed it in one go.&#34;Absolutely fabulous,&#34; she said with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group burst out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The handsome escorts ended up staying. They might as well help liven the atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear I won&#39;t do this again, Giffard! No more boys!&#34; Alexia shouted as she ran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;d better not!&#34; he replied,still chasing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just outside, Darden happened to pass by the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door was slightly open, and the sounds of music and laughter spilled into the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds like they&#39;re having fun,&#34; Darden remarked to the people with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They nodded,amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden didn&#39;t think much of it. He led his group to the next room, glancing at his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to text Brandon to ask when he&#39;d join them when a notification popped up-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>#BrandonVivianCandlelightDinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tapped it and then chuckled. &#34;Well, that&#39;s romantic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the room, Millie had just closed the door and sank into the sofa with a deep sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feels good to unwind for once,&#34; she said, taking another sip of her drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the moment, she had let go of all the weight she carried. It was a rare night to simply breathe and unwind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles smiled and sat beside her. &#34;I thought so too.But this is just the beginning. Once the Heavenly Melody finals are over, we should take Ari out for a real celebration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded in agreement. But that would have to wait until after Ari&#39;s surgery and recovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, she didn&#39;t want to think about any of that.Tonight was just for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s dance,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles smiled. &#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They headed down to the dance floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The space was packed. The crowd moved together,the dim lights pulsing in time with the music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surrounding the floor were booths, and in one of them, someone suddenly spit out his drink in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong with you?!&#34; someone beside him asked,annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look! Isn&#39;t that Millie? Brandon&#39;s wife?&#34; the man said, pointing toward the dance floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, there she was-laughing, dancing,completely at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, they&#39;re both living wildly!&#34; someone muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon&#39;s having a candlelit dinner with Vivian,and Millie&#39;s here partying! Isn&#39;t that Charles with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers spread like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Brandon&#39;s car pulled up in front of Vivian&#39;s apartment building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just planning to drop her. off and then head over to meet Darden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Vivian didn&#39;t get out right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon,&#34; she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like to come in for a bit?&#34; she asked,cheeks flushed. &#34;You&#39;re free now... so maybe we could...&#34;</p>
