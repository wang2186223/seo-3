                <p>Resting in Myron&#39;s embrace, Milie caught the faint, wavering sound of her own name leaving Brandon&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting slightly, she glimpsed him-standing alone, mouth drawn in a tight, silent line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An endless void seemed to stretch behind him, sorrow clouding his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No trace of anger crossed his face-just the hollow ache of loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A solitary tear found its way down his cheek, quiet and unbidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He squeezed his eyes shut in a futile attempt to rein in his feelings, but the grief was too strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his brow knitted in pain, Brandon dropped his eyes and drew in a shaky breath, studying the ground at his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until he sensed her attention that he finally forced himself to meet her stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this really how it ends?&#34; His words faltered, voice raw with hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave no answer, only shifted her hand,still pinned within his grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go,&#34; she said, the request soft but unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s fingers stayed locked around hers, unwilling to release her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she tried to pull away, a warm tear struck the back of her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re hurting me.&#34; Millie turned her face away from him, her eyes settling instead on Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her resolve wouldn&#39;t waver-not for a single tear on Brandon&#39;s cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, this decision had been settled in her heart long before today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, Myron pried Brandon&#39;s fingers loose, breaking his grip until Millie&#39;s hand slipped free. Brandon&#39;s gaze never faltered; he watched her intently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie kept her back to him, refusing to look ovér her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The final finger fell away, and she quietly reclaimed her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A desperate urge flickered in Brandon&#39;s eyes, but Myron blocked his path, motioning to his men nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elliott Mansion loomed behind them, its entrance ringed with Myron&#39;s security team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a subtle gesture, Myron gave the order, and his people closed in, restraining Brandon with practiced efficiency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should go,&#34; Millie murmured, her voice barely above a whisper, never glancing in Brandon&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; Myron nodded, offering a gentle touch to her wrist, soothing the angry marks Brandon had left behind. Together,they headed for the waiting Bentley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t far to the car. Myron circled to the passenger side, opened the door, and braced his hand against the frame, making sure she entered safely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she reached for the passenger door, Brandon&#39;s voice rose up behind her once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reflexes took over, and she lifted her eyes to meet his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That gentle tone-soft,weighted with longing-echoed memories from better days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered telling him, once, how much she cherished that way her parents used to speak so lovingly to each other, and how she wanted that tenderness between them,too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after setting her heart on this new path, Millie hadn&#39;t let herself soften for him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not what you think with Vivian.&#34; Brandon&#39;s words drifted over the space between them. &#34;I only need a little more time. There&#39;s still four months-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie broke eye contact, slid into the car, and left his words behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron stepped up and shut her door with care before moving around to the driver&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing for a heartbeat, he turned toward her with a gentle smile. &#34;Just wait here. Fl be right back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; she replied quietly, nodding her assent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron gently eased the door closed before making his way back toward Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence stretched as their stares collided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing out the pocket square from his jacket, Myron carefully wiped Brandon&#39;s tears away before slipping the fabric into Brandon&#39;s coat pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She belongs with me now,&#34; Myron declared coolly, each syllable distinct and unwavering. &#34;If you have tears to shed, Vivian&#39;s the one you should go to. Don&#39;t disgrace yourself by breaking down in front of the woman who&#39;s mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myron!&#34; Brandon&#39;s voice cracked with desperation, eyes raw and inflamed. He lunged forward, but Myron&#39;s men gripped him tightly, pinning him firmly in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve spent forever telling me you needed time, claimning you had your reasons,&#34; Myron said softly, eyes steady and voice controlled. He then leaned closer, voice turning hard as stone. &#34;But none of your reasons justify causing her this kind of pain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon struggled furiously, pulling uselessly against their hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron merely observed, indifferent to Brandon&#39;s desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem blind to your own actions, so let me refresh your memories. Competing with her viciously over the tanzanite, standing idly by as Vivian tormented herrelentlessly on Heavenly Melody, refusing to give her the peace she deserved-those actions only scratch the surface of what you&#39;ve done. You still have no idea how much you&#39;ve thrown away. But the day will come when you understand exactly what you&#39;ve lost, and on that day, resentment won&#39;t haunt you-only the bitter truth that you deserved every bit of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those final words, Myron didn&#39;t spare another glance at Brandon. He turned sharply and climbed into the waiting car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing Millie, his expression softened into a comforting smile. &#34;Come on. Let&#39;s get you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron fired up the Bentley, swiftly guiding the car away until its lights vanished into the dark horizon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several long moments passed before Myron&#39;s men finally released theif grip on Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, Brandon lunged toward his own vehicle to pursue them, only to be met again by an immovable blockade of Myron&#39;s men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t waste your time, Mr. Watson,&#34; one man said firmly. &#34;Mr. Elliott already anticipated your move.Anywhere Miss Bennett might go, he&#39;s made sure you&#39;re not welcome. My suggestion is to take a moment to collect yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words barely registered with Brandon, blending into a haze of noise as he stormed into his car and sped off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the Bentley sliced through the night air, smoothly cutting along empty streets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie and Myron sat in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An awkward stillness filled the space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when the traffic light ahead flashed red did Myron gently bring the car to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the soft glow from the dashboard, he glanced over at MMillie, opening his mouth briefly but finding himself unable to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could still feel the lingering heat from Millie&#39;s kiss, a warmth that refused to fade, his heartbeat echoing the memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze drifted downward, settling on the faint bruising at her wrist where Brandon had grabbed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of remorse washed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier she&#39;d assured him she could handle Brandon herself, prompting Myron to stay out of it. He&#39;d trusted that Brandon would at least be gentle with Millie, never anticipating such roughness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moved by guilt, he gently took hold of her hand and began soothing her wrist with tender fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie met his eyes and exhaled softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she opened her mouth to speak, the traffic signaI turned green. Myron gently touched her cheek and murmured, &#34;I can see there&#39;s something on your mind. Let&#39;s wait until we&#39;re back at your apartment,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind them, a horn impatiently blared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie quietly nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remainder of the drive was silent until the car pulled up outside Millie&#39;s apartment building, coming smoothly to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, neither made a move to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing a steadying breath, Myron finally broke the silence.&#34;Listen, about what just happened, if you prefer,we can pretend-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m completely serious,&#34; Millie interjected, halting his words immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron turned, startled by the intensity of her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave him a faint, resigned smile, silently wondering why no one ever seemed to take her sincerity at face value.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t do it to spite Brandon or anything,&#34; Millie explained softly. &#34;If I did, your lips wouldn&#39;t have been involved.You should understand that I made up my mind back in your art studio, but you insisted I consider carefully before giving you my answer. And my answer won&#39;t change-even if you asked me again tomorrow morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s brows drew together slightly as she searched Myron&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unless,&#34; she said tentatively, her eyes probing his expresson, &#34;you&#39;ve reconsidered?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely not,&#34; Myron answered without hesitation. &#34;Millie, I&#39;m crazy about you. Pve been counting the seconds until you&#39;d finally agree.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words tumbled from him swiftly, as though pausing might invite her doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It all seemed impossibly perfect, and he somehow feared it might simply be a dream he didn&#39;t wanf to wake up from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh bubbled softly from Millie&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He realized at once she&#39;d been teasing him deliberately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grin spread across Myron&#39;s face as he playfully reached out, pinching her gently on the cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie cast him a mock glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Myron&#39;s hand remained, shifting to cradle her face tenderly instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quiet click of his seatbelt releasing filled thebrief silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly,Myron leaned toward her,closing the gap inch by inch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips hovered tantalizingly close, her gentle breath mingling with his own, the soft sweep of her eyelashes clearly visible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This proximity set his pulse racing wildly, and with a slight rasp betraying his anticipation, he whispered,&#34;Would you let me kiss you?&#34;</p>
