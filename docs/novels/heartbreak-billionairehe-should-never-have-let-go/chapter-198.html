                <p>Time passed in a blur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, a new day had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overnight, heated discussions and growing anticipation had already informed most people that today marked the launch of Elliott Group&#39;s newest collection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The company had always been a leader in the gemstone industry. It sourced a wide range of gems from around the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If someone wanted something rare, chances were Elliott Group could provide it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Its focus had long been on high-end offerings,including exclusive auctions for custom gemstone pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, the release was rumored to fall somewhere between mid-range and luxury. But that wasn&#39;t entirely accurate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word was spreading about a rare pink diamond said to be the highlight of the collection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That, however, would come later. For now, all eyes were on the opening moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was watching to see if Millie could start strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just before the product launch, something else captured the public&#39;s attention. A short video began to circulate online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In it, a priceless blue diamond sank into the ocean&#39;s depths. A sleeping mermaid discovered it. She studied it with wide eyes, and then flicked her tail and swam upward toward the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she broke through the surface, sunlight struck the gem.It shimmered in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t notice the prince behind her. Then she turned. The camera paused as their eyes met. The blue of the gem matched his gaze exactly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a simple but striking scene. The moment hinted at the beginning of a love story. The tone aligned perfectly with the symbolic meaning of a blue sapphire-tranquility, passion, and romance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire video lasted less than thirty seconds. The cast featured unfamiliar faces, yet their performances were believable and engaging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the storyline seemed predictable, the execution was exceptional. There was no dialogue,but the emotion was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Viewers were stunned. For many, it was the most memorable piece to come out of the entertainment world in years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speculation began immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this from a new drama?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None of the actors look familiar, but they&#39;re perfect for the roles. What show is this?Ineed to watch it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then someone caught on. &#34;Wait a minute-doesn&#39;t Elliott Group have a launch today? Could this be part of their campaign?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another person disagreed. &#34;That can&#39;t be it. There&#39;s no logo anywhere. Besides, isn&#39;t Millie their spokesperson? If this was official, wouldn&#39;t she be featured?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right. That makes sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian and Johnny&#39;s team had also seen the video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone assumed Millie would appear in anything tied to the new release. Her absence made the connection to Elliott Group seem unlikely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian laughed. &#34;Looks like we&#39;re not the only ones planning to challenge Millie and Elliott Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny raised an eyebrow. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian smirked. &#34;Their official promo still isn&#39;t out. If it turns out weaker than this, they&#39;ll be completely overshadowed.&#34; She paused, and then added, &#34;Let&#39;s stir things up a little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny returned her smile. &#34;I&#39;m in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online chatter picked up fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Elliott Group really launching today? Why hasn&#39;t the promo dropped? Maybe they saw this brilliant video and gave up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, what can Millie really bring to the table?She wasn&#39;t even a businesswoman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She might set the worst sales record in company history.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;d be a disaster. Honestly, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the buzz took over the trending charts.Hashtags like #MermaidBlueSapphire,#ElliottGroupPromo and #MillieWorstSalesRecord started climbing. That morning, Millie arrived early at the event site.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the ongoing online discussions and smiled faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, she had worked closely with Elliott Group to lead with their new Blue series.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The serious covered a broad range. With sapphires featured as the centerpiece, the company had crafted a variety of products at different price points.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a fresh strategy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than rely on the usual promotions, Millie decided to build buzz online first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a market flooded with options, customers needed a reason to choose Elliott Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie knew it had to go beyond looks, price, or brand name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She believed in another motivator-status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some, owning a hot-ticket item that others couldn&#39;t easily get brought immense satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, the Blue series catered to that exact feeling. The products were mid-tier, but positioned as highly desirable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first step was to drive attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors about Millie and Myron had drawn the public eye. But gossip alone wouldn&#39;t convince anyone to make a purchase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The campaign needed a product-driven hook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The short video became that anchor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she watched online interest grow, Millie turned to a staff member at the counter and said, &#34;Let&#39;s move to the next stage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the store officially opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several new counters were unveiled, all part of the launch. Millie had overseen every detail of the renovations herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Above the counters, a 3D display hovered. No glasses were needed to view it. Outside, reporters waited in droves. Everyone knew today was the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the doors opened, they rushed inside.Microphones were pointed straight at Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Bennett, how do you plan to stand out today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve had ages to prepare, but your promo stil isn&#39;t out. Are you terrified by the mermaid video?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Bennett...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashbulbs went off like fireworks. Many livestreamed the scene. The audience grew by the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was also watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She noticed how the conversation online kept turning against Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But offline, Millie stood poised. She smiled calmly,unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she addressed the room. &#34;When you&#39;re shopping, what matters most is the product itself.&#34; Some assumed she was admitting defeat, but she wasn&#39;t done. &#34;Of course,&#34; she added, &#34;a good story can give a gemstone even more appeal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words stirred confusion. No one was sure what she meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a soft melody began to play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman&#39;s voice floated through the air, gentle and dreamy, like waves washing ashore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The large 3D screen above the counters came to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lavish cocktail party appeared on screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At its center stood a woman wearing a striking blue sapphire necklace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glasses clinked around her. Then she bumped into a handsome man and he steadied her. As she looked up, she noticed his eyes were as mysteriously blue as her own necklace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The final frame froze. The screen held on the sapphire necklace and the man&#39;s gaze.</p>
