                <p>Brandon immediately grew alert, his eyes narrowing with a cold gleam as he stared at Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Myron, stop him!&#34; Jayceon called out, hurrying over with Adriana close behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron remained calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever you have to say to Millie, say it here,&#34; he said with a polite smile, though there was a clear note of warning in his eyes. &#34;Don&#39;t try to intimidate her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon paused, glancing from Myron&#39;s face to Millie, silently asking for her take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing between us, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re thinking,&#34; Myron said directly. &#34;I just admire Serena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I do too!&#34; Jayceon added, as if eager to be heard. &#34;I&#39;ve been a huge fan for ages. Everyone knows that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adriana nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air was thick with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Vivian tried to speak in a pitiful tone. &#34;Brandon, you all...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up,&#34; Charles snapped, clearly fed up.&#34;I&#39;ve never met anyone as two-faced as you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Charles,&#34; Brandon cut in, frowning as if to restrain him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What,you got a problem?&#34; Charles shot back. &#34;You left Millie for her? You-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my fault,&#34; Vivian interrupted, already in tears. &#34;I didn&#39;t know Serena was...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; Charles was livid, but there was nothing he could do. He clenched his fists, silently fuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we&#39;re going to talk, let&#39;s do it properly. Stop crying and be clear,&#34; Adriana said sharply before turning to Brandon. &#34;Mr. Watson, didn&#39;t you want to say something to Millie? Let&#39;s all hear it, so there&#39;s no room for It all happened in a flash. Voices rose, emotions flared, and heads turned to watch the unfolding drama</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie, meanwhile, was growing impatient. She looked at Brandon. &#34;Like they said-if you have something to say,say it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of sadness passed through Brandon&#39;s eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his mouth, hesitated, and then looked around at everyone. Whatever he had planned to say,he swallowed it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stood still, watching him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few seconds of silence, Brandon finally spoke. &#34;Millie, can we talk privately sometime?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him with quiet sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; she said gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, turning away, she added, &#34;I just finished performing. I&#39;m tired and need to rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to the Elliott siblings, offered them a polite smile, and thanked them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, to Charles and Barbara, she said, &#34;Let&#39;s go. I&#39;m thirsty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not once did she look back at Brandon or Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles caught on right away. &#34;There&#39;s water in the lounge. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they neared the stairs and moved closer to the camera&#39;s frame, Brandon finally turned, watching Millie&#39;s retreating figure with aching eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie,&#34; he called after her softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t turn around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Supported by Barbara, she carried her costume and disappeared around the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the Elliott trio, Brandon, and Vivian remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon and Adriana had already moved on, chatting about what to eat next. Myron listened quietly as he walked with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon lowered his gaze, staring at the spot where Millie had stood. A trace of her costume&#39;s plaster was still clinging to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian saw it too. She clenched her teeth in frustration but didn&#39;t dare show it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She feigned innocence. &#34;I really didn&#39;t know Serena was Millie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added meaningfully, &#34;Didn&#39;t they say during the first broadcast that she&#39;d been injured ten days ago and couldn&#39;t rehearse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon still didn&#39;t respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon, suddenly turned back with a curious look. &#34;I heard she really was hurt. Fell down the stairs,apparently.&#34; He leaned into the gossip, voice tinged with sarcasm. &#34;It was pretty bad. I heard she couldn&#39;t even get out of bed for days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went on with deliberate mockery. &#34;Makes you wonder how such an accident happened in the first place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s fingers twitched slightly. His eyes were fixed on the faint trail of plaster left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon turned to Adriana. &#34;You&#39;re a woman. What would you do if you were in her shoes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adriana played along. &#34;What else? I&#39;d move on and find someone truly cherish me this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was furious, but she held back, keeping up her act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to speak, Jayceon cut her off. &#34;That medical report Charles gave was definitely fake-the timeline simply didn&#39;t add up. But everyone saw how Millie was before the performance-those injuries were real. And Serena&#39;s condition on the earlier broadcasts? Anyone with eyes could tell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian couIdn&#39;t keep quiet anymore. &#34;Mr. Elliott, are you defending her because you like her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon looked genuinely amused. &#34;Of course I like her. Is that a problem?&#34; He added matter-of-factly,&#34;Everyone knows I&#39;ve been a fan of hers since her first live performance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave an exaggerated look of surprise. &#34;Or haven&#39;t I made that obvious enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with a dramatic roll of his eyes, he turned and left to join his siblings to get some food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon and Vivian were left standing in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the car, Jayceon turned to Myron, seeking approval. &#34;How was l?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron smiled.&#34;Not bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then give me less work this month. I&#39;m exhausted,&#34; Jayceon pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron simply gave him a quiet smile that sent a chill down his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, alright...&#34; Jayceon raised his hands in surrender. &#34;But seriously, why don&#39;t you do this yourself? You always use me as your front.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car sped down the street, Myron finally replied, &#34;She hasn&#39;t agreed to be with me yet. I have to respect her wishes. If I made my feelings for her public now, it might only pressure her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Respecting boundaries was the key,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using Jayceon&#39;s public fandom as cover gave Millie space. At least she wouldn&#39;t push him away. She had always prioritized her career, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh...&#34; Jayceon mumbled, half-understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Millie and the others had returned to the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their group chat was buzzing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Led by Seville, they were launching a full-blowr counterattack online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, there had been doubts. People suspected Serena and Millie might have been colluding somehow.But after Millie&#39;s jaw-dropping performance after she removed the plaster mask, all the speculation vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena was Millie. No doubt remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the conversation shifted to the donation fraud scandal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had nothing to do with any fraudulent donations, but a new theory emerged-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Brandon&#39;s donation involved marital assets, did that mean Vivian had contributed nothing at all?</p>
