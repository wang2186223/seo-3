                <p>The group accepted the wine, and Charles asked the server to thank Myron for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Elliott is really kind,&#34; Alexia said, glancing at the expensive wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles chuckled, though he wasn&#39;t sure why exactly Myron had sent the wine-he really didn&#39;t have to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe my charm is just too much to resist,&#34; he replied after a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie acknowledged the wine with a quick glance but said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others had already opened the bottle, and the room was full of laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the Moonlit Estate, in a dimly lit room, Brandon&#39;s phone buzzed violently on the floor</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowly raised his head, hesitated, and then tapped the screen to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; His voice was tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson, something&#39;s wrong. It&#39;s Miss Simpson...&#34; the caregiver said, voice shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Aston Martin tore through the streets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon drove straight to Vivian&#39;s apartment, his lips pressed into a tight line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hurried upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver opened the door in a panic, speaking quickly as she led him inside. &#34;She&#39;s been in the bathroom for nearly half an hour. She won&#39;t open the door no matter how much I knock. I checked-one of the fruit knives is missing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon followed her to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian,&#34; he called, knocking on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Open the door.&#34; He knocked again, louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped back a little and then kicked the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It crashed inward. Vivian lay in the bathtub, her wrist bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Simpson!&#34; the caregiver cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t come near me!&#34; Vivian shouted, clearly startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still had the knife in her hand, and her expression was wild. The caregiver froze, unsure what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here, Brandon?&#34; Vivian sobbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without speaking, he walked over, took the knife from her hand, and tossed it aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call emergency services,&#34; he told the caregiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded and ran out immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian struggled. &#34;Why won&#39;t you just let meidie? If everyone already thinks I&#39;m hurting her, then why stop me? Wouldn&#39;t it be easier for everyone if I just disappeared?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian,&#34; Brandon said, trying to calm her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cried harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You never loved me!&#34; she screamed. &#34;I knew it the moment you left today. Everything that happened-l begged for it. None of it came from you willingly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wept as she went on. &#34;I was the one who asked you to stay. I changed how my name was saved in your phone. I was the one who told you to divorce her. I asked you to go everywhere with me. I made you say you loved me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears poured down her face. She watched him closely, searching his expression. &#34;You never touched me...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after the divorce, you wouldn&#39;t marry me. The way you look at her... it&#39;s never the way you look at me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon kept his head down, silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing he still hadn&#39;t said a word, Vivian frowned and tried to move her arms, as if to make the bleeding worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cried out again, breathless, &#34;You only stayed because I am dying. Brandon... if you can&#39;t keep pretending to care, then let&#39;s just end this now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She broke down completely. Still, Brandon didn&#39;t say a word. He just held her wrist, trying to stop the bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon meeting only his silence, a flicker of resentment flashed in Vivian&#39;s eyes-but she quickly hid it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept crying. &#34;I&#39;m already living on borrowed time. So what if I go a little earlier? If you love her, then go.Just leave me alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked pale and fragile, her tears mixing with the blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t say things like that.&#34; That was all Brandon said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head stayed low, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian finally smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the ambulance arrived, she closed her eyes and &#34;fainted&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, a sensational hashtag surged to the top of the trending list: #VivianAttemptsSuicide</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The accompanying video showed Brandon carrying a blood-soaked Vivian out of her apartment building. An ambulance waited at the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the background, Vivian&#39;s voice could be heard crying out, &#34;Why save me? I&#39;m already living on borrowed time. I don&#39;t know how to explain myself. Wouldn&#39;t it be better if I just ended it all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was pale, trembling, her wrist covered in blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Internet exploded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny seized the opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My God, are they actually driving Vivian to her death?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew this would happen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She only had a few months to live, and they pushed her this far. No wonder she broke down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. Those rumors, don&#39;t hold up. Vivian didn&#39;t know Serena was Millie. She joined that music show to inspire others suffering from illness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＂She was consistent， I＇ll give her that. She only has a few months to live， so why would she target Millie？＂金</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And there&#39;s no official statement saying she and Brandon were an item. People just assumed things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Netizens, unwilling to be seen as bullies, began to backpedal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many still supported Vivian, or at least hadn&#39;t made up their minds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under Johnny&#39;s direction, his team swiftly reversed the negative narrative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the conversation shifted to the dangers of online bullying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the Moonlit Estate, Derek and Norma had seen the news too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Earlier, he looked so distressed when he rushed out. I thought he had gone after Millie. I didn&#39;t expect this,&#34;Derek said angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matthew, get the car,&#34; he ordered the butler. &#34;I&#39;m going to find him. He needs to know something.Whether that woman lives or dies has nothing to do with him. The only woman who matters to him is his wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Millie saw the news as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t too concerned. Her focus from the beginning was always on winning Heavenly Melody, gaining exposure, and reclaiming the Bennett family&#39;s business from the Watson Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her recent PR battle had been one of defense, not attack. She had never meant to drive Vivian to the edge.But the situation kept pulling her back in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, now that people were reflecting on online bullying, they had stopped dragging her into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian would need time to recover and probably wouldn&#39;t return to the public eye anytime soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, another celébrity scandal had just broken, drawing attention away from the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The storm was finally calming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could finally take a breather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone suddenly buzzed. It was a message from Derek.&#34;Don&#39;t worry, Millie. I&#39;ll make sure you get the justice you deserve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie frowned slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Brandon still not told the Watson family about their divorce?</p>
