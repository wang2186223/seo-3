                <p>Tears streamed down Babette&#39;s cheeks as she stole furtiveglances at Brandon, but his eyes remained glacial, utterly unmoved by her display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babette, should you desire it, you may select your position from any of the nation&#39;s premier public or private equity establishments,&#34; Brandon declared, each word delivered with surgical precision and glacial detachment. &#34;However, that particular department remains under Bennett family jurisdiction.Your actions constitute a deliberate assault motivated purely by personal vendetta.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette&#39;s lips remained sealed, her eyes blazing with defiant fury as she locked her stare with his unwavering expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon chose to dismiss her theatrics entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pieces finally clicked into place-he finally grasped the profound significance behind the &#34;Bullfight&#34; reference and comprehended the arctic hostility that had flickered across Millie&#39;s features before her departure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bennett family/ had always commanded Millie&#39;s deepest reverence and loyalty, making Babette&#39;s calculated provocation an inevitable catalyst for her explosive reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also, witnessing Vivian&#39;s presence at the event had undoubtedly intensified her rage to unprecedented levels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nevertheless, Millie&#39;s decision to hurl wine across Babette&#39;s face before such a distinguished assembly crossed acceptable boundaries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pack away your juvenile games,&#34; Brandon commanded, delivering his parting words with devastating finality.&#34;Remember-she holds the position of your cousin-in-lawno matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having issued his ultimatum, he pivoted sharply and strode away, abandoning Babette to her solitary rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette&#39;s composure shattered completely as she released a piercing shriek, her arms sweeping violently across the nearby table and sending its contents crashing to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon navigated his path back toward his vehicle, where Vivian maintained her anxious vigil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon,&#34; Vivian called out, her voice trembling with apprehension. &#34;I&#39;ll make everything clear to Millie.Everything stemmed from the complications surrounding Macauley...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon could only meet her gaze with weary resignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What explanation could possibly suffice?&#34; Brandon questioned, his tone heavy with resignation. possesses no knowledge regarding the events from that period.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The outcome was never part of my intentions... Brandon, you must believe that I never desired such consequences...&#34; Vivian collapsed into heart-wrenching sobs, her composure completely shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your sincerity isn&#39;t questioned.&#34; Brandon offered gentle consolation while releasing a weary exhalation. &#34;Today&#39;s encounter represented nothing more than unfortunate timing, Vivian. I&#39;ll manage this delicate situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.--</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Millie guided her vehicle along the bustling avenue, enveloped by the amber luminescence of streetlights and the gradually diminishing urban landscape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No particular destination occupied her thoughts as she contemplated her father&#39;s memory and yearned to spend time with Ari, though concern gnawed at her that her turbulent emotional state might cast shadows over Ari&#39;s spirits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone vibrated against the console.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39; name illuminated the display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gathering her composure like armor, Millie accepted the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39; voice erupted through the speaker, unleashing a torrent of colorful expletives. &#34;That Brandon proves himself to be an absolute scoundrel! Escorting you to the gathering while simultaneously bringing Vivian as his companion!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie recognized that Charles had initiated this conversation specifically to provide her with an outlet for her accumulated frustration regarding Brandon&#39;s latest betrayal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And regarding that Vivian woman! Never have I encountered such brazen audacity. My preference would be her immediate demise rather than waiting another six months!&#34; Charles continued his passionate denunciation with an impressive arsenal of creative insults, prompting Millie to wonder whether he had enrolled in specialized courses for inventive verbal abuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The absurd mental image sparked genuine amusement within her, drawing forth a spontaneous chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing her laughter, Charles allowed his tension to dissipate somewhat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The waiting period approaches its conclusion,&#34; he declared with conviction. &#34;Merely a handful of days remain before you achieve complete liberation from any connections to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie directed her gaze calmly toward the illuminated roadway stretching ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely,&#34; she responded, her voice resonating with unwavering resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following several additional minutes of conversation, Millie concluded the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she continued navigating through the city&#39;s nocturnal embrace, her emotional state experienced marginal improvement,though the enhancement remained disappointingly modest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than twenty days had elapsed since Brandon first proposed their divorce proceedings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had once painted vivid dreams of their shared future-strengthening the Watson Group&#39;s foundation, elevating the Bennett family&#39;s legacy, and finally unraveling the mystery surrounding her father&#39;s untimely death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the Watson family&#39;s unwavering support and genuine love flowing between them, every ambitious goal had sparkled with achievable promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now, destiny had rewritten their story completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette&#39;s calculated disruption during today&#39;s event represented merely a superficial scratch on the surface, though it had managed to leave Millie&#39;s equilibrium thoroughly disturbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her vehicle continued its purposeless journey through the city&#39;s labyrinthine streets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Millie discovered her car stationed outside the imposing facade of a luxury hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting her head upward toward one certain illuminated window on the third floor, she experienced a turbulent storm of conflicting emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother had traveled to Crobert specifically to manage Ari&#39;s complex adoption documentation and had established temporary residence within these walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had personally arranged the luxurious suite for her mother&#39;s stay, ensuring every detail met the highest standards of comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite these thoughtful preparations, te chasm between them as mother and daughter stretched impossibly wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood with painful clarity that her father&#39;s tragic death had devastated far more than just her own existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother had endured equally profound devastation from that catastrophic loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,circumstances and unspoken grievances had driven them to this cold impasse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone vibrated once more against the car&#39;s console.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another incoming call demanded her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie wrestled with uncertainty before ultimately deciding to accept the communication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you come up? I saw your car.&#34; Her mother&#39;s voice traveled through the speaker with characteristic directness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie directed her gaze upward toward the third-floor window, where her mother&#39;s silhouette stood framed against the warm interior lighting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well,&#34; Millie responded with resigned acceptance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon reaching the suite&#39;s entrance, the door swung open before her knuckles could make contact with its surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother,Nicole Morrison, materialized in the doorway with composed dignity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They regarded each other through a moment of profound silence, neither woman finding the courage to voice the familial acknowledgment both desperately craved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie discovered herself incapable of uttering the simple word &#34;Mom,&#34; while Nicole found her throat constricted against any verbal expression whatsoever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without exchanging pleasantries, Nicole guided Millie inside and positioned herself on the plush sofa,gesturing for her daughter to join her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After an eternity of uncomnfortable silence stretched between them, Millie summoned the strength to break their mutual paralysis. &#34;Since your arrival in Crobert, have you made the journey to visit him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I have completed that obligation,&#34; Nicole replied with measured precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both women understood perfectly that &#34;him&#34; referenced Nicole&#39;s second husband-the man she had married but eventually divorced following James&#39; death and who now resided behind prison walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie delivered her announcement with stark simplicity.marriage is approaching its final dissolution as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole&#39;s expression remained as unmovable as carved marble when she replied,&#34;Very well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence descended upon them once again like a heavy curtain, suffocating any possibility/of meaningful connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The antique clock mounted on the wall continued its soft, rhythmic ticking, marking each precious second of their strained encounter. Eventually, Nicole broke their stalemate with devastating finality. &#34;I will personally manage all aspects of Ari&#39;s legal paperwork, so don&#39;t come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was politely but firmly requesting Millie&#39;s departure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie studied her mother&#39;s impassive features for an extended period before offering a single nod of acknowledgment. &#34;I understand completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that crushing simplicity, they severed their brief connection after exchanging only the most essential words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before departing the suite, Millie systematically emptied her purse of every available bill and carefully placed her most treasured necklace upon the marble surface of the entryway table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning to the solitude of the road, Millie resumed her aimless navigation through the city&#39;s darkened arteries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had harbored hope that driving without a destination might somehow lift the oppressive weight from her spirit, but the strategy had failed miserably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night&#39;s restless wind swept fallen leaves across her path, and Millie felt an involuntary shiver course through her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enough wandering for one evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The time had arrived to seek the sanctuary of home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A steaming hot bath followed by restorative sleep would surely make everything appear brighter when tomorrow&#39;s sun rose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, as she navigated toward the apartment complex where she currently resided, Brandon&#39;s distinctive Maybach materialized in her peripheral vision, parked with unmistakable intention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had successfully located her closely guarded address, despite her deliberate decision never to share this information with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recognized that when Brandon committed himself to discovering something, the outcome became inevitable regardless of the obstacles placed in his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie forced herself to avoid overthinking this unwelcome development.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She maneuvered her vehicle into an available space and emerged onto the pavement, striding purposefully toward the building&#39;s entrance, though her progress encountered immediate interference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie,&#34; Brandon called her name with urgent intensity, quickly advancing forward to obstruct her intended path.</p>
