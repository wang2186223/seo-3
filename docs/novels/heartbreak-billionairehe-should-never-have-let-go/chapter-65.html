                <p>Across the Internet, the news report exploded in popularity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On this occasion, media outlets took care to shield the child&#39;s identity-every image and detail about the minor was blurred beyond recognition. The only photograph to surface showed Millie from a distance,her hand clasped with a small child wearing a backpack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe that extra caution came from a desire to avoid crossing Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, the story sent shockwaves through online communities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, when did Millie become a mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, hasn&#39;t it only been a year since her wedding to Brandon? How could there be a child? Did they have the child before getting married? No one ever said anything about her giving birth though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One report says the kid is already old enough for school,but isn&#39;t Millie only twenty-five herself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this another one of Millie&#39;s ploys? Now that Brandon and Vivian are spending more time together,she stirs the pot wvith a stunt like this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m convinced-maybe she even engineered the viral story on purpose!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is just too much. Can&#39;t she wait six more months?Vivian&#39;s only been given half a year left to live!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gossip raged on everywhere,and meanwhile,at Vivian Floral Design, Vivian&#39;s fury boiled over as she slammed her glass down with a sharp crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, the cleaning crew swept away every shard of glass and slipped out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian reached for her phone, dialing with steady fingers. &#34;Tell me the truth. How did she suddenly turn up with a child?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reply was muffled but urgent, &#34;We&#39;re in the dark for now. We&#39;ll have to look into it. The whole thing feels off. If she&#39;s been hiding a child for years,Brandon would surely have known. Are you thinking of questioning him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that what you&#39;re suggesting?&#34; Vivian&#39;s eyes glinted,sharp as glass. &#34;You believe this story isn&#39;t real?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a good chance it isn&#39;t,&#34; the voice answered, not missing a beat. &#34;Talk to Brandon. No matter what you find out, there are ways to manage the fallout.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seconds ticked by before the voice quietly said,&#34;Vivian, whatever happens, I&#39;ve got your back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian exhaled, letting some of the tension slip from her shoulders. She pressed the button to end the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started to pace, thoughts racing as she considered every possible outcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe Millie truly did have a child, though that hardly made sense. Brandon had always wanted kids. They got married last year, so there would have been no reason to hide a child if one existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course,it could be that the child had nothing to do with Millie at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what would she gain from all this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The answer snapped into place, and Vivian broke into a sudden laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, Millie had come to terms with the fact that Vivian&#39;s reputation could not be overshadowed,so she decided to hatch this new plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of amusement flickered across Vivian&#39;s eyes as the idea settled in her mind. &#34;Never thought you&#39;d be so naive, Millie,&#34; Vivian muttered under her breath. She then scanned her contacts for Brandon&#39;s number and tapped the screen to call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, inside the Watson Group&#39;s executive office, Eugene approached Brandon&#39;s desk and offered a tablet. &#34;Mr. Watson, here&#39;s the newest update. I&#39;ve followed your instructions and had a reporter dig for extra details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon scrolled through the screen, taking in a mix of online rumors and exclusive information passed along by the reporter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The little girl in question looks to be around four or five,&#34; said Eugene, picking up the thread. &#34;She was photographed alongside Mrs. Watson at the entrance of a kindergarten. I made sure everything was wiped from the web, just as you wanted. People may still be talking online, but there will be no more details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in this digital age, celebrity spotters lurked everywhere, eager to sell any tidbit for the right price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, this was one of those moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A photograph on the screen caught Millie kneeling down to tidy the little girl&#39;s clothes, just as the child called out, &#34;Mommy,&#34; in a gentle voice. This image was unfiltered and raw, the source of all the recent rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint crease formed between Brandon&#39;s brows as he wondered about Millie&#39;s intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The appearance of a little girl puzzled him-when did she come into the picture?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for his phone, planning to speak to Millie,but a sudden vibration stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s name flashed on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a brief moment to consider, and then accepted her call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, did you happen to read the news online today?&#34; Vivian&#39;s question drifted through,her tone soft and uncertain, tugging at his empathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon wasted no time getting to the point.&#34;You mean the situation involving Millie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right,&#34; Vivian answered, her words faltering as she continued. &#34;Brandon, is that little girl yours and Millie&#39;s?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s mind sifted through memories. For seven years, Millie had always been near. If a child had ever existed, he could not have missed it. He let out a short breath. &#34;I honestly don&#39;t know, but I doubt it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s next words sounded gentle and slightly muttered, &#34;Brandon, please don&#39;t worry about me. If you and Millie did have a child, I&#39;d understand. After everything you&#39;ve shared, it&#39;s not unusual. I... I really wouldn&#39;t mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She faded into silence, and an uneasy quiet settled between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence lingered for half a minute before Vivian quietly murmured,&#34;Forget it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his gaze drifting to the sky outside his office window, Brandon watched the slow parade of clouds.&#34;I&#39;ll get to the bottom of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reply came from Vivian, not even a faint echo of her usual encouragement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tremor in her voiceslipped through the line as she admitted,&#34;Brandon, I have no wish to cause her pain.My time is running short, and there isn&#39;t much left that I desire. All I ever wanted was your love. If this situation brings her sorrow, Brandon, please return to her side. I&#39;ll be all right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears tightened her words, but she managed to hold herself together. Back at her studio, however, Vivian&#39;s face was bright with cheer,masking everything inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Releasing someone could sometimes carry more weight than clinging to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It did not take long for Brandon&#39;s reply to break the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can trust me to deal with this,&#34; said Brandon.&#34;Take care of yourself, Vivian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that very moment, Millie sat in front of her own screen, studying every headline that had appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she felt certain that every trace of the news had vanished online, Millie finally set her phone aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of a crayon sketch nearby drew a gentle smile to her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just days earlier, discovering the bottle of pills in the car and thinking of her lost child had triggered another mental breakdown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set aside everything and went to Rita&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotions surged,leaving her unsteady as she walked inside. &#34;You&#39;re not yourself right now,&#34; said Rita, watching her closely. &#34;I&#39;ve seen some things online, but I never imagined you&#39;d have to endure the loss of a child,too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside her office, sympathy softened Rita&#39;s expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated across from her doctor, Millie looked drained,her eyes vacant assilent tears slid down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What am I supposed to do?&#34; she whispered. &#34;I just feel so empty, and it hurts. Dr. Carpenter, is there a pill for this sadness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh slipped from Rita&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over just a few days, the decline in Millie&#39;s health had become obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Recovery takes time,&#34; Rita replied. &#34;I&#39;ll give you something to help you calm down for now. How does that sound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An acute episode had gripped Millie, and if things spiraled further, electroconvulsive therapy might become necessary-she would need a family member with her for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From what Rita remembered, Millie&#39;s only options were her mother or her husband, Brandon.</p>
