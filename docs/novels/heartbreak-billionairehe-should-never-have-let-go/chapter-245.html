                <p>Millie met Vivian in the lounge of Evans Entertainment at half past eight in the evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A car was parked outside. Millie noticed Brandon behind the wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t step out. Instead, Vivian got out and made her way into the Evans Entertainment building alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie glanced at her reflection in the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face looked nothing like itself-one half pulled in the opposite direction, her features transformed by special effects makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in a bizarre costume, her figure hidden, she was completely unrecognizable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waited for the elevator doors to open, eyes on the spot where Vivian would appear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Vivian stepped out and saw her, she paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eva?&#34; Vivian asked, frowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Millie&#39;s voice was rough. &#34;What do you want?I&#39;m busy,&#34; she said, gesturing towards her makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian recalled seeing others in similar makeup and costume on her way up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t surprise her-Eva was an artist under Evans Entertainment. Perhaps there was a last-minute music video shoot and she had to fillin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s talk somewhere else,&#34; Vivian suggested,glancing around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had learnt her lessons about hidden recorders.She preferred to pick the spot herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie caught her meaning and followed her to a quiet corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian checked the surroundings, and then fixed her eyes on Millie&#39;s altered face. A smug smile curved her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love of Vivian is about to premiere. I&#39;m here to give you one last chance. Keep quiet, drag Evans Entertainment down, and I&#39;ll make it worth your while.Watson Group will cover your penalty and push you into the spotlight. With your talent and their backing you&#39;ll be famous in no time,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stared at her, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the third time you&#39;ve come to me,&#34; she rasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the third time I&#39;m offering you a chance,&#34; Vivian said with certainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The final one?&#34; Millie asked, tilting her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s smile deepened.&#34;The final one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They held each other&#39;s gaze until Millie suddenly laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Vivian really think she was doing her a favor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Millie, it was the other way around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how pretty the packaging, a lie stayed a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s so funny?&#34; Vivian snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s laughter rang through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My answer&#39;s the same as before. I do not accept,&#34;she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s smile vanished in an instant. &#34;You think teaming up with Millie will help you? I can crush your plans before they even start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped closer, her glare sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve seen Crobert&#39;s buzz today. That&#39;s my doing.Evans Entertainment? Screw them! I have Brandon.When I want something, Brandon agrees. Work with me, and you&#39;ll have Watson Group behind you.&#34; Her voice dropped to a hiss. &#34;Defy me, and it won&#39;t end well for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian kept her words vague, wary of recordings, but the threat was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had the kind of influence that could sway</p>
                
                
                
                <p>public opinion overnight-power that could make or break a career.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie only smiled, the sound of her light, mocking laugh making Vivian&#39;s anger spike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ungrateful witch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian lunged, hand raised, but Millie caught her wrist mid-swing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This makeup wasn&#39;t cheap. Don&#39;t ruin it,&#34; Millie said lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed Vivian aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; Vivian seethed but then through gritted teeth.&#34;Just wait, Eva. I&#39;ll be here when you come crawling back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had planned to humiliate this detestable woman,crush her underfoot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie said nothing, watching her with cold detachment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered how long it would take for Vivian to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>trip over her own schemes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian stormed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie wandered to the floor-to-ceiling window and looked down. Brandon was leaning against the car,cigarette in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced up, catching her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her makeup was so convincing it could make a person dizzy if they stared too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stared into each other&#39;s souls. Neither spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Vivian appeared outside, pouting furiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon! I&#39;m so mad!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon shot her a calm look, his expression unreadable, as though nothing she did could ruffle him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian huffed and climbed into the passenger seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon flicked his cigarette into the trash bin,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>opened the driver&#39;s door, and looked up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged and got into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian continued pushing Love of Vivian. Ads flooded every corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the third day, she began dropping subtle jabs at Millie online, claiming the project was entirely her own and unrelated to Watson Group. Johnny&#39;s people fanned the flames, steering the conversation in her favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the fourth day, presales opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hype had built for a full week.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The marketing was everywhere-people had seen the news at least once, often more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With emotional, motivational promotions, presale</p>

                <p>And Millie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was busy bringing Ari home.</p>

                <p>For now, Millie and Ari were still staying in the apartment Millie had rented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the seventh evening, as midnight struck, the premiere of Love of Vivian began.</p>
