                <p>&#34;As our next performance, Serena brings us the song &#39;Deep Sea&#39;,&#34; the host&#39;s voice rang out as the lights on stage began to dim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, the sapphire lights came to life, casting their glow on a woman in the center of the stage. She wore a deep-blue mermaid-style dress, its fishtail cut flowing around her feet. Her waist was narrow,her arms soft and bare, and the glitter on her skin caught the lights. A half-face mask laced with tiny gems to imitate scales clung to her face, adding just the right amount of mystery to her beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took no more than a second for every eye in the room to lock on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s eyes locked on the woman on stage. She was certain her carefully planted trap was about to snap shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room hushed. The setting was spellbinding. For many in the audience, it was ther first time witnessing something like this in person, and the atmosphere left them breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon sat up slightly, his brows knitting again. That strange, unshakable feeling of familiarity crept back over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the livestream played on countless screens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first glance, nothing stood out-the mermaid-themed set looked plain, even a bit cheap. Under the lighting, it resembled a toy display, plastic and overdone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then the image flickered and something changed. What had looked plain and forgettable bloomed into something arresting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some viewers, mid-sip, paused as they realized what had happened. The stage, just moments ago boring, had come alive-its texture rich, the lighting softer, deeper,almost liquid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had once looked dull now shimmered in sharp focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mermaid&#39;s dress, its scaled fabric kissed by blue light, gleamed like ocean waves under moonlight -each glint casting Serena not as a performer, but as something mythical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, she held the room in the palm of her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At their laptops, Seville and Alexia were practically glowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Charles pulled it off!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought we were done for-but this is just perfect!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re finally taking control!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time to shut those people up for good!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie is everything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their excitement spilled over, laughter filling the room-unaware that Sheridan stood quietly nearby,listening with an amused smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Backstage, Vivian checked the stream. Her expression faltered, barely for a second, but she quickly put her mask of composure back on. She excused herself to the restroom and, once out of sight of the cameras, pulled out her phone and called Oakley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; she snapped. &#34;Didn&#39;t we have this locked down? Why does the livestream look better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe it hasn&#39;t kicked in yet. I&#39;Il take care of it,&#34; Oakley said, trying to stay calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget what you promised,&#34; she said coldly. &#34;If Serena slips through your fingers, Charles will be harder to deal with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get it,&#34; Oakley said, trying to stay calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was already too late. Oakley wouldn&#39;t be the one to fix this, not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was posted at the door of the control room, arms crossed, a smug smirk playing on his lips.Around him, a few subdued saboteurs sat slumped, surrounded by his team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, Oakley approached, unaware that the game had already slipped out of his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind the scenes, a quiet battle was unfolding, hidden from the watching crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the livestream continued without disruption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena began to sing. Her voice, gentle and low, wove itself through the ocean sounds and lighting effects that surrounded her. With each note, the stage felt like it was sinking deeper underwater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The story she sang wasn&#39;t the familiar one of a mermaid giving up everything for love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This version belonged to a girl of the sea with eyes set on the land-not just for the prince, but for the world beyond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The prince was not the reason. He was simply part of the journey. Loving the prince and walking away from him were both her own choices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t a woman led around by heartbreak. She knew how to hold on and how to let go. Always growing, always changing, but never losing herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her voice moved from soft longing to strength and clarity, the story changed-from a girl caught in love to a woman exploring a world far bigger than romance. Then, just as naturally, it all returned to the sea. Blue lights rippled across the stage. The hem of her gown danced gently in the air, mimicking a fishtail weaving through the ocean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The melody climbed higher, each note lifting the audience with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The livestream chat lit up with messages pouring in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God, this is stunning!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t take my eyes off the screen-her voice, her dress, the stage, everything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that really Serena? I used to thik she was only good with lyrics. Her stage presence tonight is unreal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She looks beautiful. This whole look is next level.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And her styling-perfect with the theme. Her makeup and hairstyle fits so well!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw her at a previous show. Her live performances have always been solid, but strangely, the stream and sound quality didn&#39;t do her justice. I said it before, and no one listened. It felt so annoying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That last comment,apparently from someone in the audience, was flooded with likes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,the video changed all of a sudden-like someone flipped a switch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. Barely a second or two in, and boom. What was dull and grainy turned crisp and stunning,just like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;People watching live, you&#39;re lucky. This is a whole experience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me, being there in person is even better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Internet buzzed wvith excitement, while behind the screens, Seville and Alexia coordinated every move,carefully amplifying the buzz online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Heavenly Melody live show, Vivian couldn&#39;t stop staring at the screen. The masked woman was already halfway into her song, and still, the broadcast refused to slip back into that poor resolution she had counted on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her frustration boiled over, and she dialed Oakley again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally picked up, she snapped, &#34;What took so long? What&#39;s going on? The show&#39;s already halfway gone, and the stream&#39;s still crystal clear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On his end, Oakley stood tense, glaring at Charles from a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His men had already been captured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heavenly Melody had multiple hands in it-production houses, talent agencies, investors. That made everything sensitive, and Charles knew he needed to thread carefully. Charles, even though known for his short temper, wasn&#39;t the reckless type to lash out without thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew that reckless action could trigger a chain of consequences that would echo far beyond the night. He was just the third grandson in the Evans line. With more episodes of Heavenly Melody still in the pipeline and multiple powerful players watching from the sidelines, Charles had done the math. He had read the room, struck the right deals, and quietly won the nod of every key investor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when Oakley tried to smooth things over with vague words and fake calm, Charles simply raised his fist and hit him.&#34;You thought the temper was for show?&#34; Charles asked coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Charles hadn&#39;t acted aggressive earlier but instead kept his calm, Oakley had been careless and come alone. No backup. And now he was outnumbered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seethed more as Vivian&#39;s name lit up his screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m dealing with it,&#34; he said curtly and hung up without waiting for her reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oakley, what are you-&#34; Vivian&#39;s voice crackled, but the line was already dead, leaving her fuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back on stage, the masked mermaid kept singing, her voice rising even higher. Every eye stayed fixed on her with amazement.</p>
