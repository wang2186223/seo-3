                <p>Fortunately, dedicated security personnel managed the standard entrance pathways; otherwise,complete gridlock would have paralyzed all movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had positioned herself strategically early and currently waited within the plush confines of her luxury transportation van.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She basked in the glow of steadily climbing pre-sale figures, waves of deep satisfaction washing over her calculating mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, look at these remarkable numbers! The statistics exceed all expectations,&#34; Vivian announced with triumphant enthusiasm, extending the tablet toward Brandon&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated beside her imposing presence, Brandon</p>
                
                
                
                <p>maintained his characteristic composure, refusing even a cursory glance at the device, instead remaining locked in brooding contemplation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian compressed her lips into a thin line, retrieved the tablet with sharp movements, and placed it deliberately on the surface before them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout recent days, Brandon had exhibited this same distant behavior, and she found herself unable to decipher the thoughts churning behind his impassive facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nevertheless, it held little importance; Vivian radiated confidence, knowing that within three weeks, he would be legally bound to marry her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon harbored strong opposition to Vivian&#39;s decision to launch Love of Vivian into the marketplace, but her iron determination left him powerless to prevent her chosen course, forcing him to reluctantly permit her advancement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Armed with the damning evidence they possessed,Charles could easily expose Vivian&#39;s deception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the unvarnished truth emerged from the shadows, Eva&#39;s reputation would achieve complete vindication, and Brandon believed he could methodically handle the resulting aftermath then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His singular desire focused on enduring these remaining four months and fulfilling their binding agreement, and then allowing everything to restore itself to its original state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If circumstances had unfolded differently...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,such speculation serves no purpose,&#34; Brandon reflected within the confines of his troubled thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to tolerate the suffocating atmosphere any longer, Brandon manufactured a plausible excuse,grasped his mobile device, and stepped outside to make.a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He navigated toward a secluded corner to indulge in his smoking habit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recently, his cigarette consumption had increased</p>
                
                
                
                <p>dramatically beyond his normal patterns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ascending smoke veiled his weathered features as he tilted his head upward toward the obsidian night sky, watching a distant aircraft traverse overhead, leaving behind a gossamer trail of clouds in its wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remained oblivious to the fact that during this fleeting moment, another vehicle glided past his position and settled into a parking space on the opposite side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car transporting Millie and Charles,accompanied by their strategic team, had rolled to a complete halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our operatives have positioned themselves perfectly,&#34; Charles announced with barely contained excitement coursing through his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie acknowledged with a firm nod, meticulously reviewing every detail of their comprehensive plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Charles, did you successfully retrieve the archived</p>
                
                
                
                <p>recording from the studio session?&#34; Millie inquired with calculated precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles confirmed with enthusiasm, &#34;Luckily you recorded the demo in our own studio. I&#39;ve already located the records from that specific session and conducted thorough voiceprint analysis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Charles contemplated their strategic advantage, the more exhilaration surged through his entire being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had definitively confirmed that Love of Vivian incorporated substantial portions of that original demo recording. Even if Vivian had legitimately purchased usage rights for Glimmer of Love,exploiting that demo crossed into absurd territory because Vivian herself had never performed those vocals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their audacious plan even involved weaponizing that demo recording to systematically dismantle Millie&#39;s Yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The promotional venue pulsated with enthusiastic</p>
                
                
                
                <p>crowds gathering from every direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie cracked open the car window slightly,intercepting fragments of animated conversations drifting through the evening air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely, I&#39;ve come specifically to experience Love of Vivian. The song Glimmer of Love resonates so deeply with my soul-its profound message truly touched my heart,&#34; declared one passionate fan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I share those exact sentiments, though I find myself gravitating toward the demo version rather than the polished official release,&#34; another voice responded thoughtfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Precisely my feelings! I adore the raw recording studio demo version above all others. They featured it prominently throughout their promotional campaigns. My anticipation has reached incredible heights!&#34; someone else added with infectious enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what about Evans Entertainment&#39;s damaging statement...&#34; Another voice faded into uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian will undoubtedly provide satisfactory explanation. Anyone capable of creating a song like Glimmer of Love possesses genuine artistic integrity.My faith in her remains unshakeable,&#34; came the loyal response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath such intense public examination, Vivian positioned herself within the livestream studio wearing an ethereal white dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The strategic illumination enhanced her deliberately applied makeup, creating a pallid and fragile appearance that amplified her carefully cultivated image of vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening to all my devoted followers.&#34; Vivian offered a graceful nod toward the camera lens with practiced elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome to tonight&#39;s special live broadcast...&#34; she began, weaving together charming persona anecdotes that painted her in a favorable light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The off-line viewers responded with overwhelming enthusiasm and engagement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Subsequently, she delivered another stirring rendition of Glimmer of Love before her captivated audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the online spectators refused satisfaction and persistently demanded answers regarding Evans Entertainment&#39;s explosive public statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my, why does everyone keep pressing me about this particular matter?&#34; Vivian concluded her musical performance,paused to sip delicately from her water glass, and projected an expression of weary exasperation. &#34;Truth possesses its own inherent strength, and frankly, there&#39;s absolutely nothing more to elaborate upon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far from her location, Charles released a bitter laugh charged with righteous anger upon hearing her brazen dismissal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie, meanwhile, maintained her composed demeanor and waited with predatory patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you absolutely insist upon receiving a direct answer...&#34; Vivian appeared reluctantly compelled to respond due to the relentless barrage of demanding comments flooding her screen. &#34;No infringement violation exists whatsoever. I remain completely baffled by whatever Evans Entertainment believes they&#39;re referencing. Glimmer of Love represents my original creative work, and I have previously shared the intimate creative journey behind its conception.Love of Vivian stands as an extension built entirely upon my musical foundation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon absorbing Vivian&#39;s defiant words, Millie&#39;s eyes transformed into razor-sharp blades of focused intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every previous statement Vivian had ever made paled into insignificance compared to this moment of blatant public denial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What they desperately needed was for Vivian to declare &#34;No infringement violation exists&#34; before thousands of live witnesses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this critical juncture, Millie turned her penetrating gaze toward Seville with unmistakable intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The moment for action has finally arrived,&#34; she commanded with quiet authority.</p>
