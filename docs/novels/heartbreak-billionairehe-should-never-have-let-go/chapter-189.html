                <p>Brandon felt like he was on the verge of losing his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of it made sense. He couldn&#39;t understand how things had unraveled so fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered Darden gossiping a few days earlier,talking about how Myron was pursuing a mysterious woman.A woman who had a child-a little girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also remembered running into Myron at the mall.Myron was buying gifts for a little girl. And all those things he said about the woman he was pursuing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the time, those details hadn&#39;t meant anything.But now, everything made sense and pointed to Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had it started? Was it during the music show?Was that when the two of them began to cross paths and grow feelings?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled the whispered comments from the Elliott trio and the look Myron had given him back then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It all connected. And it was driving him mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, are you doing this on purpose?&#34; His grip on her shoulder tightened. He wasn&#39;t even aware his reopened wound had stained her dress. &#34;Is this because of what happened with Vivian-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, someone yanked him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned, face twisted in fury, only to find Myron now standing between him and Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myron!&#34; The name tore from his throat. One look at him, and Brandon was nearly consumed by rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Myron didn&#39;t even glance at him. He looked at Millie and said, &#34;Your apartment didn&#39;t light up, so l came to check on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t messaged him like she usually did. That alone was enough to raise concern. He had circled the area, spotted Brandon&#39;s car parked in the shadows, and come straight upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve always kept to our own lanes, Myron. You-&#34;Brandon began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, go inside,&#34; Myron said gently, still ignoring him. &#34;I&#39;ll take care of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked from one man to the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after Myron gave her a reassuring nod did she turn and unlock her door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had said everything she needed to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She trusted Myron to handle what came next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door closed behind her with a gentle thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now it was just the two of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stared at the closed door. His jaw was tight,and he looked as if he might lunge again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t need to make a scene here. Let&#39;s talk in the stairwell,&#34; Myron said, already turning to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t follow right away. He stayed rooted,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>eyes still fixed on the door, his anger simmering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he knew Millie wouldn&#39;t open it again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Myron was still standing there, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, Brandon took a deep breath,forcing himself to follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stairwell was dim, lit only by the green glow of the emergency exit sign. The space was quiet,tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon faced Myron for the first time with real hostility. Until now, he had only seen him as just another business rival. But this was personal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do with her today?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s response was calm. &#34;We went on a date.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just those few words made Brandon feel like something inside him might snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A date?&#34;he echoed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right. It&#39;s not exactly a secret. Everyone online is now talking about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon let out a sharp, bitter laugh. &#34;You really think I don&#39;t see what you&#39;re doing? Your family has always been beneath mine. And now you&#39;re using her to get to me, trying to bring down the Watson Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron didn&#39;t respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay away from Millie,&#34; Brandon said, stepping forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron didn&#39;t flinch. He lowered his gaze slightly,and then looked back up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve had more than your share of meals with Vivian,&#34; he said. &#34;And you can&#39;t handle me having just one with Millie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, Myron stepped forward until he stood toe to toe with Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do want my family to succeed,&#34; he said. &#34;But that has nothing to do with me going out with Millie. I care about her. If I wanted to take you down, I have other ways. Trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon looked at him like he&#39;d just heard the world&#39;s most absurd joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You like her?&#34; he scoffed. &#34;Don&#39;t make me laugh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do.&#34; Myron&#39;s smile turned cold. &#34;It&#39;s not a joke. I told you before. I&#39;ve liked her for a long time.I think about her day and night. And you should know you&#39;re not the only man in this world, and you certainly don&#39;t get to decide who&#39;s worthy of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He met Brandon&#39;s eyes, clear and unwavering. &#34;I like the way she thinks. The way she carries herself.I respect her, even the parts that aren&#39;t perfect.I understand her better than you ever did. All you ever did was dismiss her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s smile faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said nothing,just stared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron didn&#39;t break eye contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence stretched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did she put you up to this?&#34; Brandon finally asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron only laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in that sound made the truth sink in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon exhaled,jaw tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was with me for seven years,&#34; Brandon said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;|know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We had a child.&#34; Brandon clenched his fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that too,&#34; Myron replied, his voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s chest rose and fell with each breath. He didn&#39;t look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think you know her better than I do? | spent seven years beside her, not you!&#34; he spat. &#34;She&#39;s mine. I&#39;ve seen every side of her. I&#39;ve held her through things you couldn&#39;t begin to understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept talking, the words pouring out like venom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When she cried in my arms, you were probably still out drifting on some yacht.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s face darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glow from the sign above threw sharp shadows over his expression. He stepped forward, grabbed Brandon by the collar, and slammed him into the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon let out a breathless laugh. &#34;That hit a nerve?&#34; he whispered, bloodshot eyes full of fury.&#34;She&#39;s mine. And she always will be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron looked at him. Then he smiled. But his eyes were cold.Ice cold.</p>
