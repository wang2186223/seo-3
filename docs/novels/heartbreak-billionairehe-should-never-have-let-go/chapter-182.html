                <p>The Internet was in a frenzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just yesterday, Brandon had stepped forward and publicly addressed the situation between him and Vivian at a press conference-something people had been waiting for with bated breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before the dust could settle, Vivian had gone live again early this morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, as if perfectly timed for maximum drama,the details of a shocking bet agreement had surfaced online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been glued to this drama for two days straight.What&#39;s actually going on between Vivian and Brandon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,what about Millie? Isn&#39;t she involved somehow?What does the bet say about her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is wild! I live for this kind of drama. Millie and Vivian going head-to-head? I need popcorn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online forums and comment sections lit up with speculation, theories, and debates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian didn&#39;t wait long to jump back into the spotlight.She appeared on a livestream, looking fragile and emotionally worn out. &#34;The bet is real,&#34; she admitted,her voice soft and unsteady. &#34;The timeline is exactly what&#39;s written in the agreement-three months. Derek said that if I win... he&#39;ll plan a wedding for Brandon and me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wistful smile flickered on her lips, one filled with longing and quiet sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know people will judge me for this,&#34; she said,her voice cracking. &#34;But I&#39;ve always wanted a wedding.A real one. I know it might sound selfish to some, but to me, it&#39;s something I&#39;ve wished for with all my heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her head, her shoulders sagging under the weight of emotions she could barely hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| don&#39;t know how much time I have left,&#34; Vivian whispered. &#34;I might not even make it to the wedding day. And as for Millie... I don&#39;t even know if she&#39;d agree to any of this.&#34; She paused, catching herself.&#34;Ah, maybe I shouldn&#39;t have said that. I&#39;m not feeling well today, so I&#39;ll stop here.&#34; Trying to gather herself,she forced a small smile. &#34;By the way, my miniseries Love of Vivian is currently in its final stage before hitting theaters. It may take some time, but I hope you&#39;ll stay tune to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, the screen faded to black. Her pale face and glassy eyes lingered in the minds of thousands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the store, Myron quietly put his phone away after watching Vivian&#39;s live broadcast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>·Brandon stood nearby,jaw clenched and eyes stormy Without a word, he turned on his heel and walked out of the store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron watched him go, and then looked at the plush toy in his hand, a knowing smile tugging at the edge of his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Vivian was already moving forward with her plan. She had instructed Johnny to begin the PR campaign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it was working. The Internet had quickly taken her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One wedding-that&#39;s all she wants,&#34; read a comment.&#34;If Vivian&#39;s truly dying, and Millie and Brandon are no longer together, then what&#39;s the harm in letting her have this moment? All Millie has to do... is step aside and let herself lose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Millie, just let her have this. It&#39;s not like you and Brandon are still together. Isn&#39;t a dying woman&#39;s last wish more important than your pride?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t Vivian mention her miniseries &#39;Love of Vivian&#39;is heading totheaters soon? Let&#39;s all buy tickets to support her. Isn&#39;t the outcome of the bet tied to the film&#39;s success anyway?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! Everyone, go get your tickets. Let&#39;s show up for Love of Vivian!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, a tide began to swell online-loud,emotional,and impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Other opinions, no matter how rational or skeptical,were quickly drowned in this rising storm of sympathy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone who dared question the narrative or criticize Vivian was immediately attacked, labeled cruel or disrespectful toward someone battling a terminal illness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so, Love of Vivian became more than a movie.It turned into a symbol. Supporting it became the righteous thing to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Millie arrived at the headquarters of Evans Entertainment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was accompanied by Seville and Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three stood in quiet frustration, glancing at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So... what now? Do we fight back, or do we still  pretend she&#39;s untouchable?&#34; Seville asked dryly,folding his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had just uncovered the truth-the song Glimmer of Love was actually written by Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the beginning, Vivian had only obtained certain legal rights related to the track. These included the transferable property and neighboring rights under copyright law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moral rights, like the right to be acknowledged as the original creator,still legally belonged to Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Vivian had claimed credit for everything-the lyrics, the composition, even the performance.Without hesitation or humility, she had promoted the song as her personal masterpiece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evans Entertainment had already issued a legal warning, urging her to stop her infringement. But Vivian hadn&#39;t backed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, she pushed further. Now, she was even planning to make a film inspired by the song.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s obvious Vivian wants to use Love of Vivian as her winning card,&#34; Charles commented with a serious expression. &#34;But is she really going to ignore the importance of something as fundamental as the right of attribution?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie sat still, her fingers lightly tapping the edge of the wooden table beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure what Vivian&#39;s really thinking,&#34; she said finally, her voice calm but thoughtful. &#34;But Brandon...he&#39;ll take care of it.&#34; She turned to Charles, eyes sharp with purpose. &#34;You saidBrandon tried to offer us hush money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles gave a small nod. &#34;He did. But I turned him down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie fell silent for a moment, recalling the way Brandon usually handled things. Then, with quiet certainty, she rose to her feet. &#34;It&#39;ll probably happen within the next few days. If he really plans to help Vivian win this bet, he&#39;ll come back to you. And when he does, don&#39;t shut him down completely. Just tell him you need time to think it over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if they choose to back out?&#34; Charles asked,confusion etched on his face. With the stakes so higgh,it made sense-they&#39;d likely shelve the project and begin anew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon should know that better than anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with the influence and resources he possessed,launching a fresh project for Vivian wouldn&#39;t be difficult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking away from this one seemed like the most logical choice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie&#39;s eyes met Charles&#39; with quiet certainty, her expression unreadable, her tone unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He won&#39;t back out,&#34; she said softly. &#34;He&#39;ll go through with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,across town, Brandon had already picked Vivian up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two of them were now en route to a restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of them spoke as the car glided through the city streets. Silence stretched between them,heavy and lingering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian appeared even more fragile than she had that morning. She leaned against the seat,her complexion pale,her shoulders slumped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the cityscape blurred past the windows in a rush of color and motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, Brandon finally broke the silence.His voice was low but pointed. &#34;Did you leak the details about the bet agreement?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian turned to him, her expression painted with disbelief and hurt. Her eyes reddened, her lips parted slightly, as if the question alone had wounded her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon... do you really think I&#39;d do something like that?&#34; she whispered, her voice thin and trembling.&#34;After what Eugene pulled today, I&#39;ve been on edge all afternoon. I barely held myself together and just went home to rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon shot him a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew the truth-only a handful of people had been present in the office that day when the bet agreement was first discussed. Only they had access to the original document. Now that it had somehow made its way online, the list of possible culprits was painfully short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon,I know exactly what you&#39;re thinking,&#34; Vivian said. &#34;But there are so many ways that agreement could&#39;ve gotten out. Maybe your grandparents had a hand in it. Or maybe Millie showed it to her lawyer, and they took a picture without permission. It could&#39;ve even been left out somewhere-on a desk, in a meeting room-and someone just happened to see it.&#34;She paused, her eyes growing redder, as if on the verge of tears. &#34;But out of everyone, you only suspect me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a hurt in her voice that pressed against the silence in the car,heavy and sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just like earlier,&#34; she continued, blinking rapidly,&#34;when I told you l didn&#39;t buy those stocks, and you still didn&#39;t believe me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon rubbed his temple. A dull ache had begun to build behind his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew she wasn&#39;t entirely wrong-her explanations were plausible. But his instincts screamed otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he pushed the thought aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dwelling on it wouldn&#39;t help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, the only thing that mattered was keeping Millie around. And for that, Vivian had to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, he spoke in a low, measured voice,&#34;Forget about that film. We&#39;re not moving forward with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s head snapped toward him. &#34;What?&#34; she exclaimed, her voice rising in alarm. &#34;Why? Brandon,are you helping her now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon didn&#39;t react. He simply met her gaze with a quiet calmness that made her shift uneasily in her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a problem with the right of attribution,&#34; he said,each word deliberate and measured. &#34;Before all this, maybe we could&#39;ve handled it quietly, settled it with some negotiation.&#34; But not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought back to the way Charles had looked at Millie,still posing as Serena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That quiet admiration in his eyes hadn&#39;t gone unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the look that had sparked Brandon&#39;s own suspicions about Serena&#39;s identity, suspicions he had repeatedly pushed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s jaw clenched, her hands curling in her lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love of Vivian&#34; wasn&#39;t just a random project. It was everything. She couldn&#39;t afford to stop now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one knew she was faking her illness-not Derek,not Norma, and certainly not Brandon. And with Brandon&#39;s trust already fading, even a single misstep could destroy everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To secure her place in the Watson family, she had to completely outshine Millie-show she was more worthy, more capable in every way. And when she eventually &#34;recovered from cancer,&#34; it would be seen as a miraculous comeback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie, in her eyes, had nothing substantial. She had spent years relying on the Watson Group, quietly handling Brandon&#39;s daily affairs without building a name of her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing Millie truly had was her musical talent -the same gift that had made her shine under the alias Serena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, Vivian was determined to use Love of Vivian to destroy her. In both music and drama, she would leave Millie in the dust.</p>
