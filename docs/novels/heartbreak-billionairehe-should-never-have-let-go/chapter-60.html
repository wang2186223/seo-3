                <p>The debut broadcast of Heavenly Melody had everyone glued to their screens, thanks in part to Brandon&#39;s appearance. Now,the second live show had turned into a magnet for the city&#39;s most influential people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evans Entertainment sponsored the event, and their own artist Serena was one of the most talked-about contestants, so it was only natural for Charles to attend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Vivian showing up, it was almost guaranteed that Brandon would be there as well, especially since he had not missed the first broadcast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What really surprised everyone was the arrival of the Elliott siblings. Not only did Jayceon bring his trademark energy, but Adriana and even the usually elusive Myron made an appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The result was a rare sight-every major force in Crobert was represented in the same place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This sort of gathering had never happened before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No entertainment show had ever attracted the attention of all three leading families in town at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even a few seconds of footage showing them entering the building already sent the Internet into a chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the Elliott siblings walked past Brandon,Myron gave a small nod in his direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s brows drew together in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,Brandon!&#34; Jayceon called out with his usual enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adriana also greeted Brandon, though her voice stayed cool and reserved. &#34;Mr. Watson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave a nod in return and focused his gaze on Myron,his eyes quietly searching for answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just here with my siblings to see what&#39;s happening,&#34;Myron replied in a straightforward tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon chimed in right away, his voice bubbling with excitement, &#34;I heard Serena-the star of the last charity auction-is performing. I just had to check it out, so I dragged Adriana along. Of course, she gets annoyed with me easily...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot Adriana a wounded look, and then continued with a playful grin, &#34;So I made sure to bring Myron, too.That way, Adriana had no choice but to tag along.Hehe...ouch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon wore a mischievous grin until his sister reached over and gave him a poke on the forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adriana offered a polite smile and said, &#34;Mr. Watson,he&#39;s always this way. You can just ignore him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon took it all in stride, knowing full well that Jayceon&#39;s playful side was common knowledge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Elliott family had a reputation for being both disciplined and very close. In their case, having a lighthearted little brother was almost a blessing,especially when compared to the ongoing drama in the Evans family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the group gathered together, Vivian stepped forward to join them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her style soft and refined, and this time she wore the pendant from the charity gala-the gleaming 6-carat ruby pendant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian greeted the two Elliott brothers with a friendly smile. &#34;Hello,Myron. Hello, Jayceon.&#34; Then she turned her attention to Adriana and added, &#34;Adriana, you look wonderful today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adriana felt a flash of surprise and annoyance. In her mind, Vivian was always good at making herself look charming in public, but the way Vivian addressed her didn&#39;t sit well with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most people addressed her as &#34;Miss Elliott,&#34; and she barely knew Vivian outside of these social events, so they were clearly not close enough to use first names.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,given Vivian&#39;s fragile health, Adriana decided not to make an issue of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a small nod in reply, and the rest of the group did the same, motivated by both respect for Brandon and the Elliott family&#39;s values, as well as awareness of Vivian&#39;s condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group shared a few more words before everyone settled into their seats, with little conversation after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of sight from the others, Vivian&#39;s lips curled in a faint smile as she glanced at a dimly lit corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A discreet &#34;OK&#34; sign caught her eye, and she allowed herself a moment of satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything seemed to be falling into place just as she hoped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian turned to Brandon with a look of polite gratitude, her voice carefully measured. &#34;Brandon, I honestly didn&#39;t think you&#39;d make time to be here today. It really means a lot to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon answered with a simple nod,which seemed to satisfy Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After exchanging a few words, Vivian excused herself and made her way backstage to get ready for the show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a video clip started circulating online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The footage, shot from afar, captured Vivian chatting with Brandon and the three members of the Elliott family, all of them appearing friendly and relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bold caption ran across the screen, saying, &#34;Vivian has officially joined the ranks of high society;the Elliott siblings showed up at the live broadcast just for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single video set off a fresh wave of online chatter about Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strict rules about electronic devices only applied to regular audience members, leaving people like the Elliott siblings free to use their phones as they wished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon quickly caught wind of the viraL post. He scowled at his phone and showed it to his siblings.&#34;Who took this video? It&#39;s ridiculous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron stayed quiet, showing no reaction, while Adriana shrugged and replied, &#34;There&#39;s always some rumor going around here and there. You shouldn&#39;t let it get to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, her eyes narrowed thoughtfully as she glanced toward the backstage area where Vivian was preparing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adriana could not help but wonder if it was really all just a coincidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon, unaware of the tension, kept talking. &#34;You&#39;re right. Last time they wrote nonsense and tried to match me with the McCoy daughter, her brother came to confront me, and I almost had a heart attack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sparked Adriana&#39;s curiosity. &#34;So, what did you think of her? If you actually liked her, why not spend more time together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon flushed with embarrassment. &#34;Adriana!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her laughter bubbled up as she continued to tease her younger brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spending time with him felt like playing with a big,cheerful golden retriever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, those moments hardly mattered in the grand scheme of things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone&#39;s attention stayed fixed on the competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that the eliminations were about to start, the outcome would depend on a mix of votes from the judges, the live audience, and online viewers, all tallied during the broadcast to decide who would have to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of that, the order in which contestants performed was more important than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie was set to go on stage fifth, landing her right in the middle of the lineup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The latest Heavenly Melody broadcast was as dazzling as the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the contestants showed clear improvement over their first live appearance. Every performance was thoughtfully planned and visually appealing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That level of quality came about, at least in part,because Vivian had decided not to pull any strings this round, a fact that the audience never realized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie chose a gentle rock ballad called &#34;Us&#34; for her performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her outfit, though much simpler than what she wore before, worked well with the stage&#39;s shifting lights.She sang in a soft voice, letting the music tell a moving story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The song traced the journey of a young couple getting by with very little, relying only on each other as they faltered and struggled in life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over time, as life moved on, they ended up going separate ways and leaving behind the person they once cherished most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although it sounded like a cliche story about love facing hardship,Millie&#39;s honest lyrics, storytelling style,and the subtle rock melody gave it a quiet sadness that lingered with listeners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat at the piano in a flowing gown, her figure lit by cool shades of blue, her song gentle and sincere.</p>
