                <p>Vivian hesitated the moment she stepped into the unfamiliar space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion creased her face as she turned to Millie. &#34;What is this place?&#34; she asked, trying to piece together its purpose. &#34;Millie, why is this here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath her steady voice, anger made her hands tremble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just earlier, her assistant had warned her that Brandon had already tried to get in touch, but they&#39;d ignored all his calls and acted as if nothing had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every door they might need was unlocked ahead of time, a precaution in case Brandon decided to reset any of the codes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, the chats on both Vivian&#39;s and Millie&#39;s live streams were exploding, messages flooding in faster than anyone could read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s reaction was instant as he shot to his feet as soon as he saw what happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gone was his usual polished composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A standard bathroom outside meant this inner room was clearly intended for the couple&#39;s private use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, this was once supposed to be Millie and Brandon&#39;s home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No furniture filled the space now, but the intimate design left plenty for people&#39;s imaginations to run wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take much to ruin a woman&#39;s reputation. Just the suggestion of slut-shaming alone could do lasting damage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This small,secluded bathroom was more than enough fuel for rumors to start flying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Millie stood there fully dressed and her marriage to Brandon long over, there would always be those eager to twist the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s frustration boiled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasted no time, grabbing his phone to contact the streaming platform and demand Vivian&#39;s broadcast be shut down immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just checking, my live stream won&#39;t get shut down, right?&#34; Vivian asked, forcing a shaky smile. &#34;I mean,there&#39;s really nothing to see here. If they cut the stream over this...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my very first luxury villa flower arrangement-stream,&#34; she added, trying to sound sweet and harmless, hinting that she could be treated unjustly simply because she was up against Millie. &#34;Wouldn&#39;t it be a shame if it ended now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian turned her gaze to Millie&#39;s side of the live stream and called out, &#34;Millie,any thoughts on this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, chats exploded on both live streaming rooms, their comments blending into a frenzy. &#34;Looks like the couple&#39;s getting cozy.&#34; &#34;Vivian, what are youdoing in their private bathroom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s expression turned cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t run the live stream platform, Vivian, so that&#39;s not my call,&#34; Millie replied coolly. &#34;As for this room, it&#39;s just an extra space off the main bathroom. For all anyone knows, it could be a closet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie immediately saw through Vivian&#39;s real angle-Vivian was baiting her, hoping Millie-or maybe someone else-would jump in and end her stream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Vivian&#39;s broadcast suddenly ended, people would immediately blame Millie for it. Speculation would spread that Millie sabotaged Vivian&#39;s stream just to avoid losing. People would start believing she couldn&#39;t take defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sort of label would stick, and from then on, every future victory for Millie would be dismissed as a hollow victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People would be quick to judge. &#34;She flaunts her wins, but when things go south, she just bends the rules. If that&#39;s allowed, then why shouldn&#39;t everyone else cheat, too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Myron watched the drama unfold and paused, deciding not to force the livestream offline after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His frustration deepened as he tried to call Brandon, only to be met with a dead line</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon, at that moment, was still airborne in the helicopter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let her do whatever she wants,&#34; Millie said to her walkie-talkie as she stepped away from the camera. &#34;Al that&#39;s special about this place is the design. When I moved out, I took everything with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The furniture and keepsakes were gone, but the layout still echoed memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, aside from the bathroom&#39;s suspicious decor, there wasn&#39;t anything else remotely scandalous left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, neither said a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the live stream still running, the private conversation had to be brief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The camera captured only Millie&#39;s back, showing she hadn&#39;t left, but her quiet voice was lost to the audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Myron&#39;s concern crackled through the line. &#34;Hey Millie, is everything okay with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he really wanted to ask was whether she wanted to continue or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Myron already knew that Millie wasn&#39;t one to quit that easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m good,&#34; Millie replied, her eyes hard with resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good&#34; was an understatement-she was set on coming out on top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had dragged her name through the mud for everyone to see. Letting that slide wasn&#39;t an option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment of hesitation flickered in Millie&#39;s eyes as she looked down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s attempts at public humiliation were one thing, but nowN the gossip had shifted. Everyone was talking about Myron&#39;s relationship with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After people saw the bathroom, the narrative had changed, and they were whispering nasty things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One comment, in particular, cut deep. &#34;Seven years with Brandon. Millie&#39;s got nothing left to give. Myron must be regretting it all now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of how Myron might feel gnawed at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, don&#39;t overthink it.&#34; Myron&#39;s gentle voice broke through the device, warmth woven through every word.Almost as if he could sense her worries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Footsteps echoed in the background before he spoke again, softer this time. &#34;Millie, look up here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her head, Millie caught sight of Myron standing by the upstairs glass, watching over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, I &#39;love you-no matter the circumstance, no matter what&#39;s happening. Out of everything in my life,being your boyfriend is what I cherish most. I&#39;m right here for you, and that will never change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears threatened to well up in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He really had never left her side, not for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All those years, he&#39;d always been there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of emotion nearly broke her composure, tears prickling at the corners of her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steadying herself, she finally whispered,&#34;| know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got this, Millie,&#34; he said gently.&#34;Stick to your own plan. Losing just isn&#39;t in your nature.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small,genuine smile touched Millie&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d never once doubted her own strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,knowing there was someone in her corner-someone who believed in her, no matter what-brought a warmth she hadn&#39;t felt in ages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting aside the walkie-talkie, Millie stepped back into the camera&#39;s framne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian appeared on the live stream as well, her smile brittle, eyes betraying a hínt of triumph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, where&#39;d you disappear to just now?&#34; Vivian asked, her tone a mix of feigned confusion and sly amusement. &#34;Was my live stream in this tiny bathroom too much for you to handle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie turned her attention to Vivian from live stream feed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A clear, radiant light gleamed in her eyes. &#34;I know what people are thinking right now. I&#39;m well aware of what crosses everyone&#39;s minds the second they see this bathroom, no matter what words they use in public eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a calm strength in the way she held herself, unshaken by judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need for whispers or gossip. Let&#39;s keep it honest,&#34; she said, her tone firm but open. &#34;Yes, this place once belonged to me and Brandon. That&#39;s the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bright, confident smile lit up her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment section went wild, but she held her head high. &#34;And what&#39;s so wrong with a married couple sharing a bathroom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s composure faltered, surprise flickering in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Vivian could say anything else, Millie lifted her hand in a graceful wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A staff member immediately stepped forward with a small tray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked someone to bring over a couple of things,&#34; Millie announced, fixing Vivian with a steady look. She knew these were the very items Vivian had always been curious about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion crossed Vivian&#39;s face. &#34;What are you up to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie chose not to respond. With everyone watching, she moved toward a display platform set up nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the outer area showcased vintage street photos from 1935, this corner was reserved for more recent memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>illie paused beside the platform, where a display frame was waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With deliberate care, she pulled out two documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slid them into place for everyone to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One was her marriage certificate. The other was her finalized divorce papers.</p>
