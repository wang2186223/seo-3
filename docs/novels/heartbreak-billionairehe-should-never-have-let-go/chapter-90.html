                <p>Brandon sat on the edge of the bed, his thoughts tangled and heavy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing made sense anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he tried to understand, the more everything slipped further out of his grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He unlocked his phone and called Eugene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find out when Millie last came to Serenity Villa,&#34; he said, voice low. &#34;Ask the cleaning staff. I need to know how long it&#39;s been.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene promptly sprang into action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Brandon&#39;s phone buzzed with a message. &#34;Mr. Watson, it&#39;s a bit tricky. I&#39;ve asked the cleaning staff to speak with you directly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A call came through seconds later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Mr. Watson,&#34; the voice said quickly, &#34;I&#39;m the cleaner from Serenity Villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the one in charge of cleaning the place, right?&#34; Brandon asked, getting straight to the point.&#34;Tell me-when exactly did my wife move out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cleaner paused to think before answering. &#34;I&#39;m not entirely sure about the exact date, but | think it&#39;s been about twenty days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was right around the time they&#39;d gone to file for divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few more quick questions, Brandon ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set the phone down beside him and slowly lay back on the bed, staring up at the blank, off-white ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had it really been that long?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just a few more days, they&#39;d be handed their final divorce papers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt unreal. Divorce had always been something distant-never something that applied to him and Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this truly what Millie wanted? To walk away from everything they had?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon lay there in silence, thoughts circling in his mind. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn&#39;t make sense of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This couldn&#39;t be it. Not really.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seven years. They had been together for seven years. And through it all, her love had been steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had seen her passion-genuine and unwavering-reflected in her gaze more times than he could count.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And more than that, she had always cared deeply about the Bennett family&#39;s remaining business. She used to say it was her father&#39;s legacy, something she&#39;d been a part of since childhood. She had worked tirelessly, managing those businesses now under the Watson Group like they were her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through everything, she hadn&#39;t brought up the Bennett family&#39;s business, not once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she truly intended to walk away, she would have taken it with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought brought Brandon a small wave of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she wasn&#39;t leaving after all. Maybe she was just angry-hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she learned the truth behind everything, she would understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just needed time. Six more months, and everything would be in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, he would treat her the way she deserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, there was one matter he knew he couldn&#39;t ignore any longer. He had to talk to her about Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night slipped by in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By late April, the weather had begun to soften, and spring showers came more frequently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, the rain had poured down relentlessly, but by morning, the skies had cleared just in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie held Ari&#39;s hand as they walked toward the kindergarten gate, the ground still damp beneath their feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crouched down, kissed Ari on the cheek, and smiled. &#34;I&#39;ll pick you up this afternoon,&#34; she said gently. &#34;Alexia helped us make a hospital appointment, so after school, we&#39;ll go for your check-up.Sound good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari nodded cheerfully and returned the kiss with a soft giggle, her innocence making Millie&#39;s heart swell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie pulled her into one last hug before letting go. With her tiny backpack bouncing behind her, Ari walked into the school building, and Millie watched her go, a soft smile lingering on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The previous night, Millie had gone to see Rita for a follow-up, and the news had been reassuring-her condition was steadily improving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, she could feel it too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Ari had come into her life, something within her had started to heal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each day, the shadows of her past grew fainter. She believed that by choosing to move forward and leaving behind what once broke her, she was slowly finding herself again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought steadying her, Millie turned away and headed toward Alex&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were still things to take care of today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More importantly, she needed to start preparing for the semifinals of Heavenly Melody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time passed quietly, swallowed by the day&#39;s demands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brandon stirred from sleep, the clock had already slipped past noon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for his phone instinctively, but aside from routine notifications and meaningless updates,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>there was nothing from Millie. Not a single word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the messages he had sent and the calls he had made, the silence remained unbroken-as if she had disappeared into thin air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had spent the night alone in the master bedroom at Serenity Villa. Even after pouring himself a few drinks, the emptiness of the house had crept in like a cold wind, making it impossible to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting moment, a strange thought crossed his mind-was this what it felt like to be the husband left behind? Alone in a big, empty house?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon sat up and shook his head, brushing the thought away. &#34;Ridiculous,&#34; he thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon.headed to the study to catch up on the morning&#39;s work. A stack of unfinished tasks waited for him,along with several messages from Vivian that he replied to without much thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally looked up from the screen, it was already late afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts drifted back to Millie. He had to find her. But she wasn&#39;t answering his calls or texts.She wasn&#39;t at Serenity Villa either. Where else could she be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it clicked-Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie always picked her up from kindergarten in the afternoon. That was his only lead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting another moment, Brandon requested the address of the kindergarten and drove straight there in his Maybach, arriving just before dismissal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadh&#39;t planned on doing anything-just waiting quietly for Millie. But as he scanned the schoolyard,he spotted a little girl sitting alone on a low stone bench near a tree. It was Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was focused, a crayon in hand, sketching on a piece of paper in her lap. Brandon hesitated. Then,after a moment&#39;s thought, he walked over and sat on the bench next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious, he leaned slightly to look at her drawing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was simple, childlike-full of soft colors and uneven lines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall figure with long hair held hands with a smaller child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari was now carefully writing a word beside the tall figure, each letter slow and wobbly. Mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s heart ached quietly. She was drawing herself and Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as he stared at the picture, something about it felt incomplete-like someone was missing from the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up-and found Ari watching him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her big round eyes blinked curiously at the man sitting beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mister, she asked in a bright, innocent voice, &#34;are you waiting here for your child, too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not &#34;Dad.&#34; She called Millie &#34;Mom,&#34; but she didn&#39;t know who he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon opened his mouth, instinctively wanting to correct her. But then he stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie hadn&#39;t told Ari about him. So what right did he have to say anything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He forced a soft smile, choosing a gentler response instead.he said.&#34;|just want to watch you draw.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re doing a really good job,&#34; Brandon added quietly, looking down at her picture again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari looked up with a cheerful smile and pointed at the taller figure in her drawing. &#34;This one&#39;s my mommy,&#34; she said proudly. &#34;Isn&#39;t she the prettiest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon nodded with a soft smile. &#34;She is. Very pretty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari beamed. &#34;I think so too! My mom&#39;s the most beautiful lady in the whole wide world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her joy was pure and contagious. Brandon couldn&#39;t help but smile along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, she was right-Millie truly was beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a quiet moment, Brandon glanced back at the drawing.&#34;Hey,&#34;he said gently, &#34;can I ask you something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari blinked up at him,curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pointed to the blank space beside the two figures. &#34;Do you think... maybe you could draw me in here? Standing next to you and your mom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari looked down at her drawing, clutching it tightly. Then she shook her head. &#34;No, I can&#39;t,&#34;she said simply. &#34;This picture is just for me and Mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s smile faltered a little, but he tried to keep his tone light. &#34;What if I buy you some ice cream?Would that change your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Ari shook her head again, more firmly this time. &#34;Mommy said I&#39;m not allowed to eat ice cream.&#34;Then she added seriously, &#34;And I&#39;m not supposed to take things from strangers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon opened his mouth to say something, but she continued before he could speak.&#34;Ifyou want a drawing,&#34; she said earnestly, &#34;you should ask your own kid to draw one for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him now with cautious eyes, as if she was starting to wonder if she should be talking to him at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon blinked, caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her innocent words cut deeper than anything else could have.</p>
