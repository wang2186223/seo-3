                <p>Brandon remained silent, his hands steady on the wheel as he drove Vivian back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept asking himself-was he beginning to lose sight of who Vivian really was?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian said nothing either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since she started tapping into the Watson Group&#39;s entertainment resources, things had changed.Some outcomes were unavoidable now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, with mysterious forces moving behind the scenes to help Serena and that Johnny&#39;s team couldn&#39;t handle alone, she&#39;d gone back to the Watson Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she had been smarter about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d learned from last time. This time, she drew lines -clear ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She only used the Watson Group&#39;s power to clean up rumors about herself and to expose Serena&#39;s miscarriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The messier things-the accusations about sex-for-power and donation fraud-were left to Johnny&#39;s team to deal with, all quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when Brandon received updates, all he saw were the basics: Vivian using his people to shut down false claims and retaliating a little by revealing Serena&#39;s miscarriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything else was just suspicion-no proof, unless she confessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive stretched on in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, as the car slowed in front of the floral studio,Vivian turned to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, I know you&#39;re not happy about what I&#39;m doing,&#34; she said softly,&#34;but I don&#39;t want to lie to you.If I wanted to do this behind your back, I could&#39;ve gone to Oakley. He&#39;d jump at the chance to destroy Charles. But instead, I chose to show you this version of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked straight at him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were dark. She couldn&#39;t tell what was behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She came at me too hard. I had to fight back. And all I did was tell the truth. She did have a miscarriage- ten days before the first live show. I didn&#39;t make it up.&#34;Vivian&#39;s voice wavered, her eyes growing red. &#34;Maybe you&#39;ll be disappointed in me. But I think honesty matters. It should count for something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears fell, streaking down her cheeks. &#34;Just like...&#34; she whispered, &#34;just like I know Millie is still in your heart We can&#39;t pretend these things don&#39;t exist. So let&#39;s not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon watched her cry, unsure how to feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew people weren&#39;t simple. They were layered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had stood beside him for years, and even with her,he had never believed she was entirely innocent of strategy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he didn&#39;t want her to be. He liked that she could think for herself, act when needed, and take hold of power when the moment demanded it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted her to be strong enough to survive, even if he wasn&#39;t there someday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But still,he believed in limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had to be a line. Something that separated defense from cruelty. That line was what made trust possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So was Vivian really merely revealing Serena&#39;s miscarriage, or did she do more?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if reading his silence, Vivian continued, &#34;Brandon, I know wwhat you&#39;re thinking. But I didn&#39;t do those other things. I swear. If I&#39;m lying, I&#39;ll get hit by a car the moment I step out of here.&#34; Her voice trembled. &#34;I&#39;m not the only one who wants to bring Serena and Charles down. Last time-it was Oakley. Not me.&#34; She paused, looking at him with eyes that tried to seem calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t believe me,&#34; she said, trying to sound indifferent, &#34;then go. Go back to Millie. She&#39;ll be happy. I won&#39;t be around for long, so you don&#39;t have to think about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice cracked, but she kept going. &#34;I was just defending myself. I didn&#39;t do anything wrong.Someone else would&#39;ve exposed her miscarriage anyway even if I hadn&#39;t stepped in. I&#39;m not doing this just for me. I&#39;m doing it for all those who&#39;ve believed in me. I have my own needs, Brandon. My own goals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon frowned. Her tears were steady now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dull headache was already forming at his temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene&#39;s investigation had confirmed that Vivian had only pushed back against the rumors and exposed Serena&#39;s miscarriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But still, something didn&#39;t sit right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he overthinking things?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Vivian kept crying, Brandon simply said,&#34;Go get some rest. You&#39;re not feeling well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Charles had taken Millie to Sheridan&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was already there,waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do we do now?&#34; one of them asked. They all knew who Serena really was. And they all knew what was at stake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only three days left. Then the divorce could be finalized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Serena&#39;s identity as Millie came out now,would that ruin everything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in this room knew Millie wanted out. She was serious about the divorce. But if the truth came out too soon, it could block the process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worse, if Vivian found out who Serena really was, no one could predict what she&#39;d do next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39; phone buzzed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie saw the screen-calls from nearly every investor tied to the show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles didn&#39;t pick up. He didn&#39;t dare to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More notifications followed. Messages, one after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie leaned closer and saw the same thing over and over-demands that Serena be taken off the show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pressure on Charles was piling up fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The donation fraud rumors had exploded, and the fallout was already affecting the show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of the investors wanted to take risks. If things got worse, they&#39;d pull out completely before the entire program would collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles rubbed his forehead. His head was throbbing.He flashed his phone at Millie briefly, and then slipped it back into his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They needed to come up with a plan. And fast. 1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s not rush,&#34; Millie said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been thinking on the ride over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The next livestream is the final one. If everything stays on track, I&#39;ll have the divorce decree before it Everyone nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So for now,&#34; she said,looking around the room,stall. That&#39;s the strategy. Keep my position. Don&#39;t let them disqualify me. Keep the program running. Once the divorce comes through, we&#39;ll have more control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all nodded again-but quietly. No one spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were too many unknowns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would the divorce really go through without issue?And how long could they hold things off?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles knew Serena&#39;s real identity. But the other investors didn&#39;t-and they couldn&#39;t be told.How could they fix this without revealing the truth?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the living room hung heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had started as trivial had now turned into something serious, something dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all sat with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Millie&#39;s phone vibrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked down. A call-Serena&#39;s line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is it?&#34; Alexia asked quickly. Millie shook her head. &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think someone leaked your info? Maybe it&#39;s another attack,&#34; Alexia said, her voice tense. She&#39;d seen too much of that in the industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville nodded in agreement. He had seen the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you set up a blocker for Millie&#39;s phone?&#34; Seville asked Sheridan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheridan was already reaching for his laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stared at her phone. She didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended on its own. Then two messages appeared on the screen.</p>
