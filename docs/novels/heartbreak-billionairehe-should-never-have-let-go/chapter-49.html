                <p>The entire crowd erupted into chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s still bidding? What is she trying to prove?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon has already said he&#39;ll keep bidding no matter what, and yet she&#39;s not backing down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does she honestly believe she can outbid Brandon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The price has already soared to five million, but the Tanzanite itself is only worth one million. If someone buys it now, they&#39;re paying five times what it&#39;s worth!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s really going on here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this fight really about the gemstone, or is it about the people locked in this contest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious looks bounced around the room, until finally someone asked,&#34;If two people both make the kind of declaration Brandon did, how do they resolve it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush settled for a few seconds before a reply came.&#34;It all comes down to who has the stronger will to keep going-also the deeper pocket to pay for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think back to that case in Proidan four years ago-a bidding war just like this one. Two bidders went head -to-head, and no one was backing down. The final price turned out astronomical.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That single auction almost destroyed the Todd family,one of the top names in Proidan. Their fortune took a massive hit, and the aftermath dragged on for years.Everyone in Proidan knows the story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s almost scary to think about!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right-once you&#39;re in, and it becomes impossible to back down gracefully. No one can predict who will give up first or whether the winner can even afford the final bid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So that&#39;s what could happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But 823 hasn&#39;t made any big declarations like Brandon, she&#39;s simply matching the bids. What is she really up to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beats me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, and wasn&#39;t there a bet going on? Weren&#39;t we guessing how many times she would keep bidding after Brandon jumped in? She&#39;s already gone after him once-anyone who said zero better pay up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The game isn&#39;t over yet. Let&#39;s see how it ends!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The downstairs crowd kept the chatter going, while upstairs, Vivian, who thought she had everything under control, sprang to her feet the instant she saw Serena push the bid higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp edge crept into Vivian&#39;s voice. &#34;What is she trying to pull?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Brandon&#39;s influence and standing in Crobert,everyone knew his earlier statement meant he would end up winning the auction, so why was Serena still bidding at all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible Serena honestly believed she could outbid Brandon?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not, then what was her real intention?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she provoking them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And was that challenge meant for Brandon, or was it aimed right at Vivian?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Vivian was left confused, other reactions rippled across the second floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles sat there, completely unable to guess Millie&#39;s true plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his fiery temper, he was careful about most things, and never pushed when something was out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Millie had first chosen the tanzanite as a present for her own child and-for that exact reason -didn&#39;t want Vivian to have it,there was no way they could match Brandon&#39;s resources now that he set his eyes on it, so why keep bidding?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From what Charles knew, Millie didn&#39;t act on a whim,so maybe she was simply pushed too far by the way Vivian and Brandon behaved tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought in mind, Charles leaned in slightly and said quietly, &#34;Serena, you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie glanced at him, her eyes lifting just enough to meet his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reply was simple. &#34;Do you trust me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That one look from her,hidden behind the mask,sent his heart pounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those eyes had a kind of power-enough to make anyone follow her lead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles balled his right hand into a tight fist. But a second later, he gave her a small,steady nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things had gone this far already; he was ready to go all in with her, no matter the outcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seats away, Oakley leaned in, his face lit with glee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waved at Charles and called out quietly,&#34;Can&#39;t even handle your own woman, and now she&#39;s up against Brandon. Grandpa&#39;s still here at the villa-you&#39;d better be ready for a lecture later!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words sent Charles&#39; anger boiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon might be out of reach, but Oakley was a different story-Charles wasn&#39;t afraid of him at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another thought, Charles marched straight st over to Oakley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley sneered, &#34;What are you planning, Charles?You&#39;ve been hanging around Serena for ages-aren&#39;t you tired of it yet? I don&#39;t need a brother who just sucks up to a woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all it took for Charles to snap. &#34;You&#39;d better watch what you say!&#34; He clenched his fists, ready for a fight. &#34;If you don&#39;t shut your mouth, don&#39;t blame me for shutting it for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley refused to back down. &#34;Go ahead, see if that helps. You should just wait-Grandpa&#39;s going to have plenty to say to you later!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The argument quickly spiraled, drawing attention from all around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interest sparked on the second floor as more people watched the brothers&#39; bickering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon even tried to get involved, but Adriana quickly yanked him back by the ear and forced him into his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh slipped from Adriana. &#34;Will you ever learn to act like an adult?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon murmured, sounding as miserable as a scolded puppy, &#34;As long as Myron acts the part, I&#39;ll just do whatever...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Jayceon had been more driven or capable, the Elliott brothers would likely fight each other for power just like the Evans brothers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That fact had always been obvious to him,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough.&#34; The words came from a man hidden in the dimness between the rows, and it was only then that the two finally brought their antics to a halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the auction rolled on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over at seat 888, Vivian hesitated, and then leaned toward Brandon as if trying to calm things down.&#34;Brandon, what are we supposed to do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added, voice dripping with feigned concern but carrying an edge, &#34;Does she really need that tanzanite?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon still refused to acknowledge her. His cold,focused stare remained locked on seat 823.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Serena lingered in the shadows, the silver-white satin of her gown caught the faintest light,making her presence impossible to ignore, even without the glow of moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Echoes of their earlier conversation still circled in Brandon&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her soft words seemed to carry a power that unsettled the heart-dangerous, yet impossible to resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how hard he tried, Brandon couldn&#39;t see her face, but he sensed her eyes lingering on him. Over in seat 823, Millie watched Brandon with perfect composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bidder 888 is raising the bid to six million!&#34; The auctioneer&#39;s voice rang out, barely able to contain his excitement. &#34;Anyone want to go higher? Please, feel free to keep bidding!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A round of eye rolls swept through the audience below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would even dare continue at this point?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This tanzanite was only worth a million at best. Even 1.2 million would have been steep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the bidding had soared far beyond its value-and angering Brandon wasn&#39;t worth the risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That left just one person in the running, the woman sitting in seat 823.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every eye in the room snapped back to the same spot on the second floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone saw it-her hand appeared once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With silvery nails and smooth skin, the hand lifted the paddle with calm assurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of shock ran through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The auctioneer paused for a moment but then finally announced with excitement, &#34;Bidder 823 continues.offering ten million!&#34;</p>
