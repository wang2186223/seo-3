                <p>The atmosphere instantly shifted, Excitement buzzed through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karlee chose a soft, lyrical piece so as not to overshadow the contestants, but her presence still lit up the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finished and bowed slightly, the crowd burst into applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host then welcomed the judges to the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Coming through,guys! Please make way for the judges,&#34; a staff member called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian and two other judges took the stage and gave their speeches before the final round began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Backstage, Millie and the other contestants waited for their turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s gone by so fast. I can&#39;t believe we&#39;ve reached the finals. I&#39;m not ready to say goodbye,&#34; Vivian said with a soft smile. Her eyes looked a little red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audience quietly nodded along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian continued, her voice calm, &#34;Though my time is running out, I know when I&#39;m gone, I&#39;ll remember these days fondly. They&#39;ll bring me tears of joy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath and then announced, &#34;During the break later, I&#39;ll post fifty invitation cards on my social media. If anyone wishes to attend, please use one to come to my funeral a few months from now.&#34;She bowed, her eyes wet with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you&#39;ll come dressed in your best. I want you all to live boldly, and with spirit. And I hope none of you think attending a stranger&#39;s funeral would bring you bad luck.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears filled the eyes of many in the crowd. Someone shouted, &#34;Not at all! We love you, Vivian! And we just feel sorry for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online chatter exploded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fans were full of sympathy, eager to know how to get a card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only 50? I hope I can get one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian&#39;s just trying not to bother people. She wants to keep it low-key.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s always so thoughtful. I&#39;m honestly in tears.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, show your face! See how graceful Vivian is. Don&#39;t you feel ashamed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One harsh comment even read-&#34;I&#39;d rather trade Millie&#39;s life for Vivian&#39;s.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That post quickly topped the trending list, racking up the most likes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After speaking, Vivian left the stage, letting the next judge step forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes scanned the audience, confirming that the seat beside Brandon was still empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her head, she adjusted her outfit, and a faint glimmer of satisfaction lit her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Millie. Show yourself. Let&#39;s see how you plan to handle this,&#34; Vivian thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Backstage, Millie had been watching everything unfold with a calm expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She noticed Vivian&#39;s frequent glances toward the audience-more specifically, at the empty seat beside Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew it had been reserved for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she also knew Vivian&#39;s entire speech was aimed at stirring emotions and pressuring her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s PR team really knew how to create a scene. They always had something up their sleeves-and this time was no different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie only smiled faintly. Vivian&#39;s plan wouldn&#39;t work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wouldn&#39;t be walking into the audience. She would be wNalking onto the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes drifted to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still staring at the empty seat, brows slightly furrowed, clearly lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few rows down, Jayceon and Adriana had their heads together, whispering and giggling like kids plotting something. Myron sat quietly nearby, half-hidden in the shadows, unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, let&#39;s welcome today&#39;s first contestant-Daphne!&#34; the host announced, marking the true start of the final round.</p>
