                <p>Sunlight gleamed off polished surfaces as Millie addressed Charles, saying, &#34;I&#39;ve got something to show you. Want to drop by and check it out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With barely a pause, Charles answered, &#34;Just send the location. I&#39;ll come right over!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, Millie surveyed the group. A small, confident smile touched her lipsas she said,&#34;Heavenly Melody&#39;s third live show is only two days away. Let&#39;s get started with our prep. Charles will join us soon so we can iron out all the plans.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her attention then shifted to Seville and Alexia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, nothing mattered more to her than advancing her own career and saving every penny,determined to someday reclaim the Bennett family&#39;s old property from Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gaining recognition and commercial deals through a win in the popular show was the fastest way to reach that goal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Vivian&#39;s ongoing meddling with their broadcast quality threatened to tip the public voting against Millie. This could not continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determination sharpened her words. &#34;This time, we go all out and win-no exceptions!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You got it!&#34; Seville and Alexia responded together, enthusiasm bright in their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of them had been waiting for an opportunity like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her gaze to the man in glasses-the owner of this apartment--Millie waited for his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered a careless nod and said, &#34;Feel free to use the living room or any of the other rooms. Just leave this room alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A round of nods passed through the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia, with a warm grin, spoke up. &#34;Sheridan, you didn&#39;t get any breakfast yet, right? I ordered some for us. Want me to bring yours to your room later?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheridan Nicolson met her eyes. The usual coolness in his expression softened a touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; he answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Millie glanced from Alexia to Sheridan, and then quietly exited the room with her companions in tow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breakfast was underway and everyone lingered, anticipation building for Charles&#39; arrival and the planning session to come. Suddenly, a new hashtag surged across social media-#BrandonSplitLip#.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A popular post under that tag captured Brandon, sharp in a tailored suit, striding into the Watson Group headquarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His striking features-those piercing eyes, sculpted nose, and clean jawline-demanded attention as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charisma radiated from every angle of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his commanding presence, a glaring split marred his lower lip, asif someone had taken a bite out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it have been a woman behind that mark?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Internet had been abuzz with Brandon&#39;s name lately, mostly tied to Vivian&#39;s impending demise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This new development sent rumors flying in every direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One comment said, &#34;Seriously, are we supposed to believe he bit his own lip by accident?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another chimed in, &#34;That mark looks too fresh. Who&#39;s bold enough to do that to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who else could it be but Vivian? Those two have been joined at the hip for ages. Maybe they&#39;re finally ready to show off their relationship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right. Brandon&#39;s left MMillie in the dust. Vivian&#39;s the only one on his mind now, so the answer&#39;s obvious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like things got wild between them last night! Take it easy, Mr. Watson. Poor Vivian&#39;s not in the best shape-don&#39;t overdo it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speculation exploded online, sending a stampede of reporters and photographers straight to the doors of Vivian Floral Design, all eager for a statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news soon reached Vivian herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury built inside her, jaw tight enough to make her molars ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way she had left that mark. Brandon&#39;s lips were unblemished when he stopped by last night. Clearly, whatever happened to his lip had to have taken place after he left. But what exactly had gone on between him and Millie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Simpson, there&#39;s a crowd gathering outside.&#34; Concern tinged her caregiver&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s glare darkened as she took in the scene beyond her window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She realized a response was unavoidable. However, she absolutely could not let anyone find out that Millie was behind the bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Brandon and Millie&#39;s divorce still pending, the two remained married in the eyes of the law.Recently, Vivian had been stirring up drama to prove that Brandon&#39;s affections lay with her, and that only the unloved one could be considered the third wheel in a relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Revealing that Brandon and Millie were still intimately involved would spell disaster for Vivian&#39;s reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claiming responsibility for the bite was also out of the question-Millie could easily expose the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind raced, searching for a workable solution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An idea sparked. She scrolled through her phone, landed on a familiar name, and quickly dialed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,outside Vivian&#39;s studio, the commotion only grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People elbowed their way closer, vying for a better view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration simmered as time dragged on with no sign of Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, the entrance swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian appeared, leaning on her caregiver for support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color had drained from her face, leaving her looking fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a voice barely above a whisper, she said, &#34;Forgive me, I&#39;m not well today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone present sympathized, aware that she&#39;d been given only half a year to live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reporter called out, &#34;Miss Simpson, were you the one who bit Mr. Watson&#39;s lip?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another chimed in, &#34;Miss Simpson, have you and Mr. Watson become romantically involved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A third voice called out, &#34;Miss Simpson...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity surged, but the staff formed a protective barrier, keeping the eager crowd from getting too close to Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of pink crept into Vivian&#39;s cheeks as the barrage of questions continued, her usual composure giving way to a bashful glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement rippled through the onlookers, making them all the more certain of their suspicions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle cough, Vivian steadied herself before addressing the assembly.&#34;Everyonshe said,her voice soft but clear. &#34;I&#39;d rather we not get caught up in rumors and speculation,&#34; she said, sidestepping the subject entirely as she moved the conversation elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Today, I&#39;m happy to announce some exciting news. Vivian Floral Design has joined forces with a film studio to produce a web series inspired by my song Glimmer of Love. Not only that, but the theme song for the series will be Glimmer of Love itself.Please look forward to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A graceful bow followed her words, her dignity intact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interest lingered in the crowd, but the hunger for gossip remained. Vivian&#39;s lips curved into a gentle smile as she continued, &#34;I truly hope you&#39;ll pay closer attention to my work on behalf of the chronically ill. My aim is to spread hope and resilience-may you help me share that spirit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By shifting the focus, Vivian painted herself as a figure of virtue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fresh wave of coughing broke up her speech, and she offered a quiet apology. &#34;I&#39;m running out of time, so you&#39;ll have to forgive me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her caregiver&#39;s steady arm, Vivian disappeared back into her studio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clips of her response swept across the Internet, drawing admiration for her compassion and excitement for the upcoming series. The question about the bite faded from people&#39;s minds-her shy demeanor had spoken volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In another part of town, Alexia caught wind of the headlines and threw up her hands in outrage.&#34;Unbelievable! Brandon spent last night with you at Moonlit Estate, so what&#39;s Vivian pretending to blush about?&#34; Alexia&#39;s irriation was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville&#39;s eyes lingered on Millie, a spark of intrigue in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking another mouthful, Millie finally broke the silence. &#34;Vivian called and asked him to come by last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she finished, everyone at the table seemed to process that news in their own way. Millie continued, her tone casual, &#34;Still, I was the one who bit Brandon. He came home this morning in a mood and tried to kiss me out of nowhere. I wasn&#39;t having it, so I bit him. Simple as that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s hand balled into a fist as she replied, &#34;Now it makes sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A different light dawned in Seville&#39;s eyes, revealing just how much Vivian&#39;s actions puzzled him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for Millie, none of that mattered right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts turned entirely to Vivian&#39;s next move-plans to relaunch Glimmer of Love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing boundaries seemed to be Vivian&#39;s specialty; even with a legal notice from Evans Entertainment&#39;s lawyers, she was doubling down, showing no sign of backing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was Brandon&#39;s influence that gave her such nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the grand scheme, Millie knew it would not last. The higher Vivian tried to climb, the further she would tumble once the truth emerged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the conversation and clinking cutlery, the sharp ring of the doorbell cut through the air.Charles had made his entrance.</p>
