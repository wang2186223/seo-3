                <p>As the news exploded online, the sixth contestant was just about to step on stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Serena&#39;s private dressing room, Millie finally noticed Vivian&#39;s move-she had seen the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled softly and glanced at Charles beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally, Charles had caught it too. He was already typing. &#34;It&#39;s all because of that fake medical record from before,&#34; he wrote.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie smiled, shook her head, and sent a message to their group chat. &#34;No need to get sidetracked. Our only focus right now should be my sheer talent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles nodded in agreement. That was exactly the stance they had just decided on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena was a contestant who wore a mask made specifically for the show. No one had heard of her before the competition began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant her fans wereall viewers of this program,drawn purely by her performances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as she delivered and didn&#39;t cross any serious lines, what did it matter if she had a boyfriend? And anyway,she didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing to explain, and certainly nothing to deny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it!&#34; Alexia replied instantly in the group chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia and Seville were still at Sheridan&#39;s apartment.Although Sheridan used to only allow them to use the study,recently he&#39;d started letting them use the living room freely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville, though a bit of a homebody,had a sharp mind for PR.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly mobilized all his buddies. &#34;Group One, push the TalentsOverRumors hashtag-use sharp visuals and catchy memes. Group Two, create momentum around Serena&#39;s singing skills, boost every post highlighting her talent. Group Three, you&#39;re with me.We&#39;ll stir the waters and keep the opposition confused.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia coordinated between the different teams, and then regrouped with Seville to consolidate data and plan their counterattack against Vivian&#39;s camp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone had their role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, on the other side, Vivian&#39;s team, led by Johnny,was mobilizing as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny gave his own set of instructions. &#34;Group One, argue that Serena&#39;s performance wasn&#39;t about talent.Emphasize that this is a music competition. Her visual flair doesn&#39;t even count. Group Two, plant seeds about a possible romantic connection between Serena and Charles-suggest she lacks moral integrity. If necessary, start spreading rumors about her messy private life. Group Three, stay alert. When the opposing team moves,we strike back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What followed was an all-out online war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in the end, Serena&#39;s ability spoke louder than any rumor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean she&#39;s not talented? Are you blind?Five instruments, five vocal styles, five languages-all in a single performance-with top-tier lyrics and composition. If that&#39;s not musical strength, what is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That comment soared to the top of the trending discussion,racking up thousands of likes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It struck a chord with a wide audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online users might be misled at times, but they weren&#39;t blind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at Johnny&#39;s command center-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, we&#39;re losing ground. Serena&#39;s performance was too strong. Nothing we post is sticking. And their team&#39;s no slouch either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of his subordinates hesitated before asking,&#34;Should we leak that miscarriage scandal we prepared?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny didn&#39;t dare take that step without consulting Vivian first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already messaged her multiple times, but she still hadn&#39;t replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grew more anxious as the sixth singer wrapped up and began the audience appeal part. He sent another message,urging a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why hadn&#39;t Vivian reply to any of his messages?Because she was in trouble herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still in the staff corridor when someone approached her with a polite smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Simpson,&#34; the man said, &#34;we have something you might find interesting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian ignored him at first, until he played a recording.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her voice recorded earlier in that same hallway.Her expression changed instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man leaned closer. &#34;We&#39;ve been planting devices here since the first live broadcast of Heavenly Melody.Think about everything you&#39;ve said in this very corridor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were recording me without permission?&#34; Vivian&#39;s voice trembled with fury. &#34;Aren&#39;t you afraid I&#39;ll sue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man smirked. &#34;Do you think we&#39;d be doing this if we hadn&#39;t considered that? The question is-which is worse? Us getting sued, or having your secrets exposed? Think carefully. If you don&#39;t cooperate, my partner&#39;s heading straight to Serena. I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be very interested. Oh, and Millie too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his voice. &#34;Give us a little something,and you can keep Mr. Watson. Otherwise... if he finds out what you&#39;ve been hiding, I doubt it&#39;ll be worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He began to count. &#34;One. Two. Th-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; Vivian snapped before he could finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in Serena&#39;s dressing room,Millie found it strange that Vivian hadn&#39;t made another move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exchanged a look with Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed puzzled as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t like Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the sixth contestant finished their appeal.Commercials and variety clips rolled, giving both the live and online audiences time to cast their votes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Voting inside the venue moved steadily, while online voting was a heated race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena remained in first place, but the other contestants were closing in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each had their own fanbase, and online voting allowed fans to cast multiple votes across different contestants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian finally emerged from the small room with an ugly expression on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had demanded ten million dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where was she supposed to find that kind of money so quickly? And even if she could,it wasn&#39;t worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Simpson,&#34; the man had told her, &#34;you can transfer two million now. The rest? Get it from Brandon. With his wealth, ten million won&#39;t be a problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no choice, Vivian transferred the two million and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blackmailers weren&#39;t worried she&#39;d run. They had leverage-and they knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They celebrated behind her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, you&#39;re a genius! I was getting impatient, but you said to wait. You were right! Now she has no way out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, boss! You&#39;ve really nailed it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They laughed, oblivious to the cold glint in Vivian&#39;s eyes as she walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paying them off wasn&#39;t enough to fix the problem She had to silence them for good. Otherwise, they&#39;d just keep coming back for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still planned to marry Brandon, and she had to ensure nothing got in the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression unreadable, Vivian pulled out her phone and saw Johnny&#39;s latest message. She was just about to reply when everything changed</p>
