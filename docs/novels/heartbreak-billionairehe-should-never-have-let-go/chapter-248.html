                <p>The moment Vivian&#39;s words hit the public, a wave of backlash against Millie flooded in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone knows Glimmer of Love was Vivian&#39;s original creation. If there&#39;d been an issue before, why didn&#39;t anyone speak up? Now they&#39;re just accusing her to ruin Love of Vivian&#39;s rise on the charts!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie&#39;s only acting out of jealousy. She&#39;s been writing and singing for years, but she&#39;s never managed to outshine Vivian. This is just her way of trying to drag Vivian down!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How disgraceful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie is horrible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before the insults could snowball further, Evans Entertainment fired back immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their official account posted a statement along with a copy of a legal notice, originally sent right after Vivian&#39;s first public performance of Glimmer of Love,in which she had claimed it as her own work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The notice made it plain that the song had been written by Eva, only to be forcibly purchased by Vivian and Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie reposted the statement without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The effect was instant. A storm broke out online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re telling me Vivian didn&#39;t write Glimmer of Love at all, and the real songwriter is someone named Eva?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The legal notice has dates and timestamps, and it even shows a record of it being emailed directly to Vivian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t Glimmer of Love get re-recorded later with an Eva in the credits? Wait-is that the same Eva? Could Vivian really have...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions for Vivian started flying almost instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Vivian had been expecting this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint smile, she placed a rose into a vase and asked softly, &#34;Do you believe them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the spotlight, she looked flawless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sorrow in her eyes mixed with quiet strength,drawing sympathy from those watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A staff member nearby muttered, &#34;We never should&#39;ve gone to Evans Entertainment to re-record Glimmer of Love back then. We thought that since Eva helped a little, we&#39;d added her name. Now they&#39;re twisting it to attack you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when the staffer member finished did Vivian speak.&#34;Enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her manner radiated innocence and kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the damage has been done, their words had already gone out live-stream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scene buzzed with chatter, and the noise quickly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>spilled online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian tried to be kind and ended up being used by Evans Entertainment and Millie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eva-whoever you are, say something! What&#39;s the truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evans Entertainment should start a live-stream-if they&#39;ve got proof, show it. Otherwise, stop throwing around baseless claims!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Millie, stay out of it. This is between Eva and Vivian! Quit trying to grab attention!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demands for answers flooded the Internet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the venue, someone even set up a projector,pulling up Evans Entertainment&#39;s official account page and displaying its freshly updated feed for everyone to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around her, reactions unfolded, and Vivian struggled to keep the satisfied smile from breaking across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another flower was clipped and set neatly into the vase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What chance did Eva, a mere small-time singer, have of ever beating her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Charles? He was nothing more than Millie&#39;s lapdog. Taking him down would be effortless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s focus returned to her flowers, arranging them with deliberate care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s move on to the next step,&#34; Millie said softly as she watched Vivian from a distance, All eyes shifted to the massive screen as Evans Entertainment&#39;s social media feed began updating in real time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The new post read. &#34;Here is the contract both parties signed initially, with confidential sections removed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several photos appeared underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only select portions were visible. The rest was hidden due to confidentiality reasons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian gave a light laugh as she read it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to face the live-stream camera, she said,&#34;This is the evidence they&#39;re so proud of? It&#39;s ridiculous. With something like this, I could frame half the industry if I wanted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment her statement ended, fresh evidence was already appearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s eyes stayed on Vivian&#39;s self-satisfied expression as she gave a slow tap of her finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new post went up from Eva&#39;s account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The update turned out to be an image. It was a photograph of a copyright registration certificate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the song had been sold, the document was a special registration for authorship rights, with all transfer details clearly marked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s eyes stayed fixed on the flood of incoming comments,her gaze unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Showing the contract and the legal notice was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>merely formalities, while revealing the actual agreement and their repeated warnings proved that Vivian&#39;s actions were deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now came the real blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville moved without hesitation, and Evans Entertainment&#39;s official account immediately reposted the evidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The copyright registration for Glimmer of Love (formerly titled Glimmer of Light) can be verified on the official website.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The document made it clear that Eva was listed as the sole lyricist and composer, with Vivian&#39;s name nowhere in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single piece of evidence flipped the entire situation on its head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Industry professionals rushed to the official website,confirming that the Evans Entertainment posted record was accurate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the big screen, the staff member projecting</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evans Entertainment&#39;s page followed the verification process step by step, proving its legitimacy to everyone present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, well! This is the official copyright certificate.Let&#39;s hear what Vivian has to say now,&#34; Charles said with a cold,mocking laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After countless instances of Vivian teaming up with Oakley and Brandon to crush them, he had finally had enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie, however, stayed quiet, her attention locked on Vivian from across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both in the off-line venue and across the Internet,the scene had descended into chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thousands were now demanding Vivian explain the copyright registration issue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian said nothing at first. Only after she placed the last flower into the vase did she rise to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie watched quietly, recognizing the start of Vivian&#39;s carefully staged act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s eyes were already rimmed with red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; had no idea about any of this,&#34; Vivian said, her voice rang out through the microphone, carrying to both the live audience and viewers online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dry, bitter laugh slipped through before she added,&#34;All I can say is the song is mine. But I barely understand how the music business works.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze locked onto the camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eva, you must be watching right now,&#34; Vivian continued, recalling the cold reception she&#39;d received when meeting Eva a few days earlier, fueling her determination to make Eva come crawling back!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An even more hurt expression now etched on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve known each other for ages. Back then, I was clueless, and you helped me. I was grateful, Eva.Even though the song was originally mine, I still credited you. And now, this is how you repay me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears began spilling freely down from Vivian&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You talk about registrations and legalities, things l never learned. My health&#39;s been fragile, soI let you handle those details,and you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another shaky, bitter laugh escaped as Vivian cried,her tears falling in an unbroken stream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve always been thankful to you. I never once brought these things up. Even when you worked with Millie to write songs for Elliott Group&#39;s new products,I kept quiet. I only wished you well, but now you...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s voice trembled, her emotions spilling over,and a few people both in the room and watching online began dabbing at their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Glimmer of Love was written before the first livestream of Heavenly Melody. Back then, I was at death&#39;s door... why would I ever do something so cruel? You know I poured my love and my despair into that song. We spent so much time together.Don&#39;t you remember? We wiped each other&#39;s tears.You know all of this, and yet you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tears stopped, and Vivian fixed her gaze on the camera. &#34;If there&#39;s even a shred of conscience left in you,come forward and explain the truth. This is your last chance. I&#39;ll forgive you, but only if you tell the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down Vivian&#39;s face as she stared into the camera, all while secretly laughing to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eva, did you catch that? So what if you have copyright registration?&#34; Vivian thought with smug satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if the lawsuit ended in Eva&#39;s favor, this public narrative would stain her reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eva&#39;s career would be ruined completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And even if Charles poured resources into supporting Eva, it wouldn&#39;t change a thing. Because public opinion was already stacked against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside their car, Charles was seething, fighting the urge to smash something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie kept her eyes fixed on Vivian. Her lips curved</p>
                
                
                
                <p>into a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s twisting of the truth and flawless performance didn&#39;t surprise her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the giant screen on the venue lit up as the Evans Entertainment had started a live-stream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The video was from a phone, the background filled with noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Eva.&#34; A woman&#39;s voice rang out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s head snapped toward the screen, her eyes red. She knew Eva was about to appear on camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As far as Vivian was concerned, if Eva wanted to protect her future career, she&#39;d have no choice but to stand at Vivian&#39;s side.</p>
