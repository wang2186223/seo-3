                <p>When Millie&#39;s group were about to leave, the area outside the Blue Lounge was packed wall to wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone seemed eager to snap a photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie and the others were being jostled by the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Brandon had just stepped out from the club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sea of people separated them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is insane. Where did all these people come from?&#34; Charles said, pulling out his phone, ready to call for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could, a security team rushed in,quickly forming a barrier between Millie&#39;s group and the swarming paparazzi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles looked confused. He hadn&#39;t even made the call yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The team leader approached their group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Bennett, Mr. Evans, we were sent by Mr. Elliott to escort you home,&#34; he said with a slight bow before turning to Alexia and the others. &#34;You&#39;re all covered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles narrowed his eyes. &#34;Which Mr.Elliott?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Myron Elliott,&#34; the man replied.&#34;As a partner of Evans Entertainment, he heard about your situation and offered his support.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization dawned. Charles nodded. &#34;Please extend my thanks to him.&#34; Then he turned to Millie. &#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The team leader gave Millie a polite smile. She returned a brief glance, said nothing,and followed Charles to the waiting car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to get in, a voice rang out from the crowd-&#34;Millie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Darden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked over and spotted him, his expression tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next to him, Bradon stood silent, his gaze locked on her,intense and uhreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie lowered her eyes, turned away, and stepped into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing more to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they were to meet again, it would be when she walked into Watson Group with the agreement they had signed to reclaim what belonged to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car door shut and the engine started,Brandon&#39;s line of sight was finally broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The paparazzi, realizing they had missed Millie and Charles,swarmed around Brandon instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson, are things tense between you and Millie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are rumors you&#39;re both involved in affairs. Any truth to that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson, what&#39;s the current state of your marriage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Watson-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden was already dialing frantically, trying to get them out of there while microphones crowded in on Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon didn&#39;t move. He wvas still staring in the direction of the car that had just turned the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, we&#39;re getting crushed!&#34; Darden shouted into the phone, and then turned to Brandon.&#34;Brandon, let&#39;s just-Brandon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to pull him back into the club while they waited for backup, but Brandon stumbled, nearly collapsing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden caught him and placed a hand on his forehead. &#34;You&#39;re burning up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Brandon didn&#39;t respond. He just stood there,watching the street where Millie had disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, the interior had been thoughtfully stocked-hangover medicine, bottled water, snacks,and even spare clothes in case anyone felt ill and threw up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the back seat, Alexia opened a snack and glanced at Charles. &#34;Your business partner&#39;s pretty impressive. As soon as he found out we were stuck,he sent a rescue team and even stocked the car.Everything&#39;s ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles looked puzzled too. Was he really that close with Myron? &#34;I&#39;m actually lost here. Myron&#39;s always been mysterious. He wasn&#39;t even based in.the country until a couple of years ago. I don&#39;t know.Maybe he just wants to support the follow-up promotion for Heavenly Melody.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already turned Myron down once. But since the Elliott Group was helping now as a business partner-not for personal reasons-she had no grounds to refuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the ride continued smoothly, Alexia scrolled through her phone. A news alert popped up: Brandon had been taken away by an ambulance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment&#39;s thought, she handed the phone to Millie. She would find out eventually anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what he gets,&#34; Charles muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie simply looked at the screen and nodded. No further comment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, Brandon woke up in a haze.His vision was blurred, his body weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone was gently wiping his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out and grabbed the hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie,&#34; he rasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve mistaken me, Mr. Watson,&#34; the caregiver said softly,withdrawing her hand. &#34;I&#39;m not your wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His vision gradually cleared. It was indeed a caregiver standing beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned his head. The sterile ceiling and the IV drip confirmed where he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon!&#34; Babette&#39;s voice rang out as she entered the room. &#34;Millie is unbelievable. You&#39;re in the hospital, and she&#39;s out having fun? She&#39;s nowhere to be seen. It was Darden who brought you in. Your phone&#39;s been right here, and I checked-she hasn&#39;t even called once!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon felt drained. He didn&#39;t have the strength to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up his phone. Messages from his grandparents, work partners, and even Vivian-everyone had checked in. Except Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was the fever or something else, a hollow ache settled in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette was still going on and on. &#34;She&#39;s so heartless. I just can&#39;t believe-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s head throbbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set the phone aside and closed his eyes again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought back to a time when he had fallen ill,just like now. Millie had been by his side the entire night,running around to care for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he woke up in the morning, she had been slumped over at his bedside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled by the sound, she had looked up, eyes filled with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re awake,&#34; she had said, touching his forehead.&#34;Thank goodness, the fever&#39;s gone. I was so worried.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, a stranger sat where she once had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The contrast struck him with such force it became hard to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette&#39;s voice kept droning on and on. Brandon barely heard anything now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough,&#34; Brandon interrupted, voice hoarse. &#34;Go home,Babette. I&#39;ll be fine tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette wanted to protest but held back, seeing the state he was in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. I&#39;ll come by again tomorrow,&#34; she said before giving a few instructions to the caregiver, and then left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in the quiet, all Brandon could see were the fragments of his life with Millie-meeting her when they were young, falling for her, the days they had shared, and the moment she shut the car door today without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed that illness made people vulnerable and sentimental.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And tonight, Brandon was drowned in memory.</p>
