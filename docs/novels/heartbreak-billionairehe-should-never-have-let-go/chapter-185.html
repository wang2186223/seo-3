                <p>Millie looked at Vivian and smiled. &#34;Why do you think I will choose not to reveal the truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian froze, as if hit by something she didn&#39;t see coming.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stood beside them, frowning at Millie. Was this all a trick?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just mentioned needing money. That made it seem like she was ready to give in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie stayed calm, her expression steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some things can&#39;t be patched up with a simple sorry.&#34;Her voice came out raspy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter the reason, hurt was still hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t sell my right of attribution. If you came here hoping I&#39;d change my mind, then you&#39;ll be disappointed,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian opened her mouth, but Millie gave a quiet laugh.&#34;You were the ones who pushed me into selling the song.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused and turned slightly, eyes meeting Vivian&#39;s.&#34;But I didn&#39;t force you to infringe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Millie stood and prepared to leave. Charles stood beside her, a smug look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eva,&#34; Brandon called from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t stop or turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you&#39;ll reconsider. You&#39;ve got talent. If we can settle this, Watson Group is willing to invest in your future,&#34; his voice followed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the girl in the frog mascot costume walked straight out of the meeting room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian watched her go, fury twisting her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eva was clearly using their conflict to strike a better deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Brandon...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian glanced at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was going through his mind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s head back,&#34; Brandon said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian quickly adjusted her expression, trying to look upset instead of angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold off on the film for now. I&#39;ll get you into other projects,&#34; Brandon added, still staring after the frog.What exactly was Eva trying to pull?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian didn&#39;t respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe to Brandon, any project would do. But not for her. &#34;Love of Vivian&#34; was special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to succeed. It had to shine. Only then could she fully outshine Millie and win the Watson family&#39;s approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed a plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Millie turned to Charles. &#34;To defeat someone, first drive them crazy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People only valued things they earned with effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When something came too easy, it always raised suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie took off the frog costume and looked up at the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles followed her gaze as he removed his own costume, admiring her profile. &#34;What are you looking at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The weather&#39;s nice today,&#34; she said. Perfect for her first date with Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles looked at the sky and nodded. &#34;Yeah. It is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, Millie changed into a soft blue dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At dusk, Myron&#39;s car pulled up outside her apartment building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his anxious yet eager eyes, she climbed in,and they drove to the harbor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was a little worried earlier. I thought you might back out,&#34; Myron said after they arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would I?&#34; Millie smiled at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been looking forward to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got out and walked to the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The evening was beautiful. The sea stretched wide and blue,meeting the warm orange sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their table was in a quiet corner of the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron had planned this evening long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked and talked, neither noticed the reporters hiding nearby, snapping away in secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard Myron booked a restaurant to charm some mystery woman. Jackpot! Keep clicking!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, later we&#39;ll sneak in dressed as staff and get a clear shot of her face!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie and Myron eventually arrived at a quiet, secluded part of the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place actually had two parts-above and below sea level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He led her down to the underwater section.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through clear glass walls, they could see fish gliding by in a calm, dreamy world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they sat, Millie spotted a few fish hovering near the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Myron chatted briefly with the chef, Millie touched the glass out of curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fish twitched and then quickly darted away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gestured for the chef and the wait staff to leave and turned to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me your hand,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie thought for a second, and then offered the hand that had touched the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now your index finger,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She extended it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took her hand and gently pressed her fingertip against the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now watch,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her surprise, the fish swam toward her fingertip.More followed, swirling together, forming a beautiful scene in the quiet water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The motion stirred the water, and the soft lights made it feel like magic-like she was underwater herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you like it?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glass was cool under her finger, but his palm was warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie turned and saw his gentle smile. She nodded with a smile of her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you do that?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let go of her hand, signaling her to check her  finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sparkled slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The fish are drawn to this glittering powder,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked at her fingertip, and then touched the glass again. The fish came right back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s amazing,&#34; she whispered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Years ago, I ran into all kinds of strange creatures at sea. If you&#39;re curious, I can tell you more,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d love that,&#34; Millie said with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She traveled a lot for work, but most of it was by air.The sea was still a mystery to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He began telling stories-about rare creatures,minerals, and distant places she&#39;d never been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She listened, more relaxed than she had felt in a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were no games here. No overthinking. Just his voice and the sea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once, in Eldoria, I saw something the locals called &#39;Blue Rain.&#39; It fellall night-glowing,gentle,beautiful,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that like? Did you take pictures?&#34; she asked,caught in the wonder of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll show you,&#34; he said, reaching out his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at it, hesitated for a beat, and then placed her hand in his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled and held it tightly, guiding her back above sea level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, night had fallen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they climbed the steps, Millie saw it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Near the shore, beneath the soft glow of lights, a small patch of Blue Rain was falling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not like the sky&#39;s blue-this was glowing, magical, like something from a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out, catching a few drops in her palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt unreal, like a scene from a fairy tale.</p>
