                <p>Energy surged across the little island as people flowed in from every direction, drawn by the excitement in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight&#39;s event welcomed all, but there was a dress code, so guests arrived in their finest, eager to join the festivities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glowing lights shimmered across the water, and more than a few guests speculated about the significance behind the dazzling display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone even managed to catch Myron&#39;s impromptu magic show for Millie on video and posted it online, where it instantly began making the rounds. Viewers everywhere were transfixed,swept up by the impossible wonder of it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, is the island this lively just because Myron wanted to put a smile on Millie&#39;s face? That&#39;s actually adorable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, am I the only one dying to know how he pulled off those tricks? I need to learn them-I&#39;ve got to impress my girlfriend somehow!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m in,too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As chatter buzzed through the crowd, Egbert caught sight of the video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was halfway through dinner and nearly choked on his food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That bastard Myron-he really played me!&#34; Egbert slammed his fork onto the table, cursing under his breath. &#34;He&#39;s got that whole bookish act going,but underneath he&#39;s as slippery as they come. One minute he seems to know nothing about romance,the next he&#39;s pulling stunts just to impress Millie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steam practically billowed from Egbert&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d been plotting his own big gesture, especially since Flesta had a reputation as the country of romance. But now Myron had stolen the spotlight right out from under him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw clenched at the memory of Myron shoving that wooden fox sculpture he was offering Millie as a gift right back into his hands, making himn look like a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way I&#39;m letting this slide.&#34; Without another thought, Egbert yanked on a fresh shirt and thundered down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Brandon caught the video too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d only just gotten back after dropping Vivian off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Vivian who pulled up the video and handed it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like Myron&#39;s got his eye on Millie,&#34; Vivian remarked,voice lilting with mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s jaw clenched, but he refused to give her the satisfaction of a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s eyes danced with amusement. &#34;First he made blue rain falling just for her, then a cozy fishing trip, and now he&#39;s got her grinning on that island with his little magic show. Honestly, Millie doesn&#39;t look like she&#39;s resisting. Maybe she&#39;s finally ready to say yes to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words stung, each syllable twisting the knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon felt something tight and bitter coil in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When did Myron start putting on a show like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the island, Myron was already weaving Millie through the bustling streets, his hand clasped lightly around hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He led her from one breathtaking spot to the next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused at a spice vendor, flashing Millie a playful grin. &#34;Check these out. I acquired them from a small village in Gliphis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of his wrist, Myron scattered a pinch of  the spices onto an open flame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire caught instantly, swirling up a strange, wild aroma that drifted on the breeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie breathed it in, the scent so earthy and sharp it conjured the image of a deer bolting through the morning mist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,&#34; Myron murmured, moving closer. He tied a delicate sachet at her belt, letting his fingers linger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent was unmistakable-exactly the same as the one he&#39;d just lit moments ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This made the fifth sachet he&#39;d fastened to her belt that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie broke into laughter, shaking her head.&#34;Honestly, you&#39;re making me feel like I&#39;m in one of those palace dramas, where the emperor ends up with a whole collection of sachets dangling from his waist-each one from a different concubine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron flashed a mischievous grin. &#34;In that case, I guess you&#39;ll have to think of me as one of your pampered wives, Your Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at him, speechless for a second, untif he lifted a single finger, eyes twinkling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;m putting in a special request,&#34; he added.&#34;want to be the imperial consort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie rolled her eyes with theatrical exasperation but couldn&#39;t hide her smile. Myron burst out laughing,the easy camaraderie between them lighting up the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both understood it was nothing more than playful banter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they wandered on, Myron steered her toward a small stall tucked between busier vendors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tabletop overflowed with polished stones, each one smooth and cool to the touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Check this out,&#34; Myron said, his tone low and conspiratorial. He grabbed an object and carefully set it atop a nearby stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, the stone ignited, flames twisting upward in a swirl of blue and gold, casting strange shadows over their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow!&#34; Millie took a startled step back, her lips parting in awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t it look like a heart set on fire?&#34; Myron asked, a mischievous grin flashing across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement danced in Millie&#39;s eyes, her whole expression alight with wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was almost uncanny how much it resembled a heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flame quickly flickered out, but Myron&#39;s attention never wavered-he watched Millie with an intensity that sent a thrill down her spine, as if he could see the same wild spark kindling in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laced his fingers through hers, steady and certain, and led her onward, weaving through the bustling crowd until they reached the heart of the island-a sprawling square ablaze with life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At its center, a towering bonfire roared, its flames illuminating a swirling sea of dancers dressed in vibrant, unfamiliar costumes. Laughter and music rose into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Myron took Millie&#39;s hand and swept her into the rhythm of the dancers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stood inches apart, Millie&#39;s eyes fixed on Myron&#39;s masked face, flickering in the firelight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gazed up at him, her pulse racing. For a moment, she had the disorienting sense that she&#39;d seen him like this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A motorboat tore across the waves toward the island,churning up a frothy wake behind it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the helm, Egbert muttered a steady stream of curses, his eyes narrowed with impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gripped something in his hand, but the object stayed hidden in shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myron, you slippery bastard, just wait tilf i get my hands on you!&#34; Egbert bellowed over the roar of the engine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the bow scraped the shore,he leapt off without waiting for the boat to stop, landing hard on the sand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert barely broke stride, yanking out his phone to check the latest intel from his network.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new message flashed on his screen-&#34;They&#39;re caught in a dance, right in the middle of the bustling central square.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a muttered curse, Egbert broke into a sprint,racing for the central square.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the center of the bustling square, Millie gazed at Myron, her mind drifting to a distant winter night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christmas-the air heavy with the scent of mulled wine and fresh snow, music spilling into the streets as revelers whirled across the icy square.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amid the chaos, a masked man with a faint trace of blood on his sleeve had pulled her close, winding his thick Christmas scarf around her shoulders, shielding her from the biting cold. That warmth, so vivid, came rushing back to her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt as if a buried memory was stirring awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, secretive smile played behind Myron&#39;s mask as he lingered before her. With their faces hidden,only their eyes met-each searching the other and finding an unspoken spark reflected back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though not a drop of wine had touched her lips that night, Millie felt an odd, heady dizziness, as if the world around them had tilted slightly out of focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden craving for mulled wine crept up on her-rich and comforting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could voice it, Myron steered her through the bustling crowd, pausing at a small stall where steam curled over pots of mulled wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed a warm cup into her hands, anticipation glimmering in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with the heat of the day, Millie welcomed the drink, lifting it to her lips without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wine was gentle-more soothing than strong layered with flavors-and she let it linger on her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;ls it to your taste?&#34; Myron&#39;s voice drifted over her shoulder, low and coaxing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded, her eyes lingering on the red liquid swirling in her cup. She murmured, &#34;Yeah. I like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron glanced at his watch, the movement almost secretive, and then shot a quick look across the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knowing grin tugged at his lips. &#34;Come on. There&#39;s something I want to show you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting her cup aside, Millie fell into step beside him,curiosity prickling at her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He led her around the corner-where an enormous air balloon, vibrant and otherworldly, hovered at the ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron turned to her, his eyes dancing. &#34;How about a ride?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; Millie replied, slipping into the basket alongside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were alone, enclosed by the curved wicker and the faint tang of propane. Myron deftly worked the controls, and the balloon surged upward, rising above the patchwork streets and distant rooftops.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The higher it rose, the smaller the world became-yet Millie noticed a figure below on the ground, jumping furiously, their identity lost in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned toward Myron, catching the glimmer of mischief in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was that down there?&#34; she asked, her voice light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Egbert,&#34; Myron answered, his lips curving into a crooked grin. &#34;He tried to cut us off, but I had omeone tip me off the moment he set foot on the island.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of Egbert&#39;s wild thrashing made Millie break into helpless laughter, the sound bubbling up and carried off by the wind.</p>
