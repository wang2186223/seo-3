                <p>Millie looked up from her phone and caught the faint smile forming at the corners of Myron&#39;s mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you might want to wait a little longer,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised an eyebrow. &#34;Really? Then maybe you don&#39;t know me as well as you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron&#39;s eyes crinkled. His tone was light but held a trace of expectation. &#34;Well, I suppose I have all the time in the world to change that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze shifted to her phone, where a stream of messages continued to roll in. After a moment&#39;s thought, she opened her profile and updated it by adding &#34;Singer, Serena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She deleted every reference to the Watson Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once finished, she looked at Myron.,where to next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still had to consider the wager agreement, but Myron wasn&#39;t just a casual acquaintance. He was also one of her business partners. Most of the champion&#39;s resources for Heavenly Melody came directly fromthe Elliott Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron glanced briefly at the document in her hand.He didn&#39;t say much. &#34;Let&#39;s start with lunch. I know a place you might like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded. &#34;Sounds good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere,Brandon sat in the back of a car, staring at the flood of notifications on his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the hashtag #MillieAndBrandonDivorce, the comments were relentless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw this coming the moment Serena took off her mask on Heavenly MAelody.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rumor has it they started the divorce process before Vivian&#39;s condition got worse. Looks like it was finalized fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, I misjudged you. I thought you stayed for money.Now I see you&#39;re moving on without hesitation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at her profile. She removed all mention of the Watson Group and Brandon. It&#39;s just her now.&#34; More	hashtags	appeared	soon	after:	#</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MillieUpdatesProfile,	#</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MillieCutsTiesWithWatsonGroup</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon read every word, his grip tightening around the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she really this resolute?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier at the office, he had only caught the tail end of her conversation: &#34;Not everyone sees Brandon as a prize. To me, he&#39;s just someone I met as I wwent through life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just someone she met as she went through life? After seven years of shared memories, long nights, and mutual effort-was that really all he meant to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him, Vivian was typing on her phone.He glanced her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She noticed, slipped her phone into her bag,and looked at him with a soft smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon,you&#39;ll help me, won&#39;t you?&#34; she said quietly,her expression fragile. &#34;You&#39;ll fight for our future together, right?&#34; She looked like someone who needed protection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s eyes dimmed. He clenched the agreement in his hand. Yes,&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t let Millie win. He couldn&#39;t let her slip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone buzzed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a message from Darden, who had a knack for digging up rumors. &#34;Explosive news! Someone saw Myron shopping for a toddler. He even bought some decor in a little girl&#39;s style!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon frowned.A girl?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another message followed. &#34;Not sure who the woman is, but she had a child with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image of Ari came to mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew Myron well enough. Behind his cultured mask was a man known for never getting his hands dirty,yet always winning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gentlemanly act must&#39;ve fooled so many people.He was cunning, careful, and patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Myron was involved with someone, it would be a calculated move. Likely someone with a powerful background that could boost his family&#39;s business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But who could it be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car sped along, Brandon stared out the window,silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside a suite at an international hotel, a man sipped wine while scrolling through the trending headlines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A waiter stood nearby and spoke politely. &#34;Mr. Perez,everything your request has been arranged. Do you need anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert lowered his glass and waved him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked slowly toward the floor-to-ceiling windows,eyes fixed on the lights below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Divorce,&#34; he murmured. &#34;Millie, I wonder if youstill remember what you once said to me. The man you would have sacrificed everything for... now let you down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reflection in the glass stared back at him. &#34;But maybe it&#39;s a good thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his glass as if toasting someone far away.&#34;Walking away from him might lead you somewhere brighter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek and Norma sat side by side as Matthew drove to Moonlit Estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really think this will work?&#34; Norma asked.&#34;Will Millie win?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek scoffed. &#34;Do you think she&#39;s less capable than Vivian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not in ability,&#34; Norma replied. &#34;But still...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek looked at his wife and sighed. &#34;If we hand everything to Millie directly, Brandon would fight us on it. We needed a plan that lets him think he still has control. Using the illusion of marriage with Vivian and a few strategic threats should do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norma nodded. They had agreed on the approach before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the city rushed by. Derek watched the blur of movement and said quietly, &#34;If he can see Vivian for what she is, and how kind Millie truly is, then all of this might be worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon dropped Vivian off at her flower studio,Vivian Floral Design,and then headed straight back to the Watson Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the entrance, Eugene was already waiting, visibly anxious. &#34;Mr. Watson, we&#39;ve been swamped with calls Executives,partners-everyone&#39;s demanding answers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene had messaged him earlier, prompting the urgent return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette appeared soon after, flustered and agitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, this is getting out of control,&#34; she said. &#34;The shareholders are furious. They&#39;re saying they should have been notified about the divorce. Some are worried this will trigger a billion-dollar stock split. And the partners Millie handled are asking questions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice rose. &#34;Why didn&#39;t she tell us before going public? Now we&#39;re in the middle of a crisis!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon shot her a cold glance. She stopped speaking at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew it wasn&#39;t Millie&#39;s fault. He had been sitting on the divorce decree for days. He had plenty of time to act but he did nothing, so Millie had every right to move forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Babette didn&#39;t stop. &#34;Brandon,you know many of our partners worked with her directly. If she&#39;s severing ties with the Watson Group in public like this, I&#39;m afraid some of them might walk away.&#34;</p>
