                <p>Millie turned and saw Nicole, her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She froze, uncertain of what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time she had visited Nicole at the hotel,Nicole had asked her not to come again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the years, Millie never quite knew how to approach her. Even though Nicole was her mother by blood, too much stood between them after James died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Millie spoke. &#34;Mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole glanced at her, gave a small nod, and stepped inside with a gift basket. She placed it on the bedside table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here to see Ari,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded, pulled out a chair for her, and then turned to Ari, searching for a way to begin the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could say anything, Ari called out brightly,her face lit by a cheerful smile. &#34;Grandma!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole smiled back. &#34;What a sweet girl!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She began chatting with Ari, and Millie watched with a sense of disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never expected Nicole to come see Ari willingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, the mother and daughter had drifted apart after everything that had happened between them back then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari laughed, clearly enjoying their talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the conversation wound down, Nicole looked at Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie understood and guided her to the smal balcony. Ari stayed behind, happily distracted with her toys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the balcony, they could still keep an eye on Ari while speaking privately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The adoption proceedings should be finalized soon,&#34; Nicole said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded. Her heart picked up pace, but she couldn&#39;t think of a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went to see him a few days ago,&#34; Nicole said after a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie frowned. She knew who Nicole meant.Hayden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time Millie herself had seen him was the day he was sent to prison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole went on. &#34;I found out something. After thinking about it, I decided you should know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Millie asked, puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon visited him twice lately. The first time was right before your divorce was about to be finalized.The second was on the day of Ari&#39;s surgery,&#34; Nicole said, watching Millie closely. &#34;Have you really moved on from Brandon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie looked at her. Nicole&#39;s face still held faint traces of the beauty she once had,though hardship had softened them. This was the first time in a while she had said something that sounded like a mother speaking to her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded. &#34;I&#39;ve moved on.&#34; She paused. &#34;And I&#39;m starting a new relationship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole didn&#39;t look surprised. &#34;With Myron Elliott?&#34;She must have seen something online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Millie replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole gave a quiet nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do what feels right,&#34; she said. &#34;I&#39;ve told you what l came to say. I&#39;ll head back now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded and walked her to the door. After a moment&#39;s hesitation, she hurried to her bag, pulled out all the cash, removed her jewelry, and handed them to Nicole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole looked down at her hand, and then up at Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie kept her head lowered and said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, Nicole took the items without a word and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie watched her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This had always been their dynamic. Along with cash and jewelry, Millie had also given Nicole a card she occasionally topped up.①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aside from the rift caused by Hayden&#39;s imprisonment, their relationship had remained distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Millie appreciated Nicole&#39;s help with the adoption paperwork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time moved quickly. Two more days passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie was having a meal with Ari when her phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A notification appeared. &#34;Re-recorded version of &#39;Glimmer of Love&#39; is released.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A re-recorded version?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t know what had changed, so she tapped it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw the updated credits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before, it had read- &#34;Glimmer of Love. Singer:Vivian. Lyrics: Vivian. CComposer:Vivian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now it said- &#34;Glimmer of Love (Re-recorded Version). Singer: Vivian. Lyrics: Vivian / Eva.Composers: Vivian/Eva.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were only smnall changes. A few words in the lyrics. A brief shift in the composition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The song still sounded much the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie found it amusing. What was Vivian trying to do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evans Entertainment had already completed the copyright registration to sue Vivian. The songwriting credit had been under Eva&#39;s name alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything related to the song-its performance data, Vivian&#39;s past statements, legal documents from Evans Entertainment-had been properly notarized and filed with the court. The evidence was secured.Even deleting anything wouldn&#39;t change that.Adding Eva&#39;s name now-did Vivian think that would somehow fix things?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They hadn&#39;t filed the lawsuit against Vivian earlier simply because they were waiting for the mini-series -Love of Vivian-to launch. A bigger payout was more likely after that. It had never been about lacking preparation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian posted a message on her social media. &#34;The earlier version I recorded felt immature. It had many flaws. I&#39;ve since trained with a vocal coach and created a re-recorded version. I hope everyone enjoys it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t care about the re-recording itself. What caught her attention was how Vivian planned to explain the new credits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, she wasn&#39;t the only one curious. Online discussions had already begun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is Eva? Why is there a second name on the lyrics and composition?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| thought Vivian wrote it all herself. Who&#39;s this Eva?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can someone explain why the credits changed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone eventually replied with an explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eva is the musician who helped with the re-recording,&#34; the user wrote. &#34;The changes are small.Just a few tweaks to the lyrics and composition. The new version was recorded at Evans Entertainment&#39;s place,and Eva works there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, people seemed to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Eva helped with the re-recording and Vivian added her to the credits? Vivian is so kind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The online conversation continued. Some thought Eva was taking advantage of the situation. Others praised Vivian for her generosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie was surprised by how people reacted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The story made it sound like Vivian had done most of the work. Eva&#39;s name was there as a courtesy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This spin worked in Vivian&#39;s favor. It painted her as gracious and uncompetitive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A clever move, indeed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Vivian probably hadn&#39;t expected how prepared they really were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the phone of Eva buzzed with a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Vivian calling.</p>
