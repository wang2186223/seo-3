                <p>When her words faded, Millie turned to scoop Ari into her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glance at his watch reminded Brandon that Eugene and the rest of their group hadn&#39;t arrived yet.&#34;Eugene is on his way. Let&#39;s not risk driving after a few drinks. How about we mark the night with a picture while we wait? It&#39;ll be a nice memory,&#34; he suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before their separation became official, Brandon yearned for one last photo of them together-a keepsake to bridge the months apart if they ever decided to reunite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A family portrait would be something to hold onto when all else felt uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he chose not to share this longing with anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment of hesitation flickered in Millie&#39;s eyes, but Ari&#39;s small hand wrapped around hers, silently urging her not to say no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a barely-there voice, Ari whispered, &#34;Dinner at the neighbor&#39;s house, remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gentle comment served as a nudge-they went so far, and it simply wasn&#39;t worth it to refuse Brandon now. What if he got mad and changed his mind about the divorce?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie took a deep breath and agreed with a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waving a staff member over, Brandon handed off the camera he&#39;d brought just for this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, they made sure the angle was right, the backdrop framing them perfectly against the sea&#39;s vast expanse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Few places in the city could rival the beauty of this seaside restaurant, especially with the windows framing the endless water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with night blanketing the sky, the shoreline sparkled, bathing the ocean in a breathtaking glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon extended his arms, his voice gentle. &#34;Let me take Ari,&#34; he said, hoping to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of accepting, Millie shifted to one side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without raising her gaze, she replied quietly, &#34;I&#39;ll manage on my own.&#34; Any contact between Brandon and her daughter was something she wanted to avoid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari wrapped her arms tightly around Millie&#39;s neck, her words a soft plea. &#34;Millie, I want you to hold me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with nothing to say, Brandon conceded, his disappointment masked behind a polite nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was how their family portrait came to be-posed, stiff, and with a tension that clung to the edges of the frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff member returned with the camera, offering it back with a smile. &#34;Here you go, Mr. Watson.How did it turn out? If you&#39;re not happy, we can always try again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t wait for a reply. &#34;It&#39;s good enough,&#34; she said,voice firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sleepy sigh, Ari nestled closer to Millie. &#34;Millie,I&#39;m tired. I want to go home and sleep,&#34; she murmured, her yawn stretching across the quiet room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing only briefly at the snapshot, Brandon tucked the camera away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A simple gesture dismissed the server, and quiet settled over the three of them, thick as the night outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocking Ari gently in her arms, Millie turned with a question.ny idea when Eugene and the others will show up? If they&#39;re running late, I&#39;ll just find a taxi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave a reassuring answer. &#34;They&#39;re probably close.&#34; In truth, he hoped the wait might stretch a little longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little more time might allow for the honest conversation he&#39;d been wanting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, his optimism faded as Millie focused solely on Ari, her soothing touch making it clear she had no interest in chatting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance flickered across Millie&#39;s face as she remembered Alexia&#39;s warning from earlier. Alexia had even set things up so Giffard was standing by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to take control, Millie poulled out her phone and searched for Giffard&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon caught sight of the name on her screen, and his expression darkened with suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A question slipped out. &#34;Why are you calling him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Brandon was right there, and his people were almost at the door. Why reach for Giffard?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie pressed the call button anyway. &#34;He&#39;s picking Ari and me up,&#34; she answered simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer didn&#39;t sit well with Brandon. His frown deepened as he reached over to end the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34; Millie shot him a fierce glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon spoke up, his tone firm. &#34;Eugene is nearly here. There&#39;s really no reason to involve anyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Ari was safely dropped off, Giffard would still have the task of getting Millie back to her place safely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the end of their marriage drawing near, Brandon found himself resisting the thought of Giffard giving her a ride home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed the point again. &#34;Let my team handle your ride.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of frustration swept over Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her patience had already worn thin-she hadn&#39;t even wanted to pose for the picture earlier, and now she felt cornered again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp reply left her lips. &#34;Giffard&#39;s character is above reproach. He&#39;s not the type you&#39;re implying he is.&#34; Despite her words, Brandon refused to give in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could say more, her phone began to buzz, Giffard&#39;s name bright on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitating, Millie accepted the call. &#34;It&#39;s me,yes. We&#39;re on the second floor. Can you come get us? Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation ended, leaving her to wait beside Ari in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm of frustration brewed inside Brandon, though there was nothing he could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every effort he&#39;d made to smooth things over-choosing this place, trying to show patience-had been meant to bring her some comfort.①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments earlier, he thought he&#39;d glimpsed a shift in her mood, some softening. So why did she reach for Giffard now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years spent believing he understood her had done little to help in recent weeks. Each day made her more of a mystery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had Millie turned so unyielding?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after he explained Vivian&#39;s illness, insisting she didn&#39;t have long, Millie&#39;s anger refused to fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He called her name, &#34;Millie,&#34; hoping to bridge the distance, but she said nothing, cradling Ari close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Brandon could find the right words, a sharp knock sounded at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie responded instantly, crossing the room with Ari still clinging to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A twist of the handle revealed three faces-Giffard,Eugene, and the woman she didn&#39;t recognize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without delay, Giffard crossed the threshold,taking his place beside Millie and Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene&#39;s eyes flicked around the room, confusion clouding his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He distinctly remembered Brandon asking for a female driver to assist with transportation. Yet, for some reason, Giffard had shown up instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension hummed in the air, made sharper by the way</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon regarded Giffard-every glance tight and guarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Eugene seemed uncertain, his voice faltering before he finally spoke. &#34;Mr. Watson, we-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interrupting swiftly, Millie cut in, &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it,Eugene. Giffard was already here. He&#39;ll be driving me, so there&#39;s no need for the driver you brought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having worked alongside Eugene before, she preferred not to create any extra difficulty, especially when she knew Brandon was the reason he&#39;d come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without sparing Brandon a glance, Millie turned to Giffard. &#34;Would you mind fetching my bag and Ari&#39;s backpack from the rack?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In response, Giffard gave a quiet nod, cast a quick look in Brandon&#39;s direction, and walked off to collect their things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stood by, silently observing Giffard as he tucked Ari&#39;s backpack away and handed Millie her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Preparations complete,Millie and Giffard made ready to depart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her name left Brandon&#39;s lips in a quiet plea.-&#34;Millie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No response came from her; instead, she fell into step behind Giffard, making her way downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their history together ran deep. In their youth, he had rescued her more than once, but her own sacrifices-seven long years of her life and the pain of losing two children-had been just as real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such was the nature of love and loss, forever tangled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once upon a time, their passion burned so brightly that parting felt impossible, and they would have risked it all for each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, moving on sometimes came as suddenly as a storm breaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she resolved to sever ties, nothing could stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding Ari close, Millie walked steadily toward her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertainty flickered between Eugene and the female driver as they glanced Brandon&#39;s way.&#34;What now,Mr.Watson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill crept into Brandon&#39;s tone. &#34;Get in the car,&#34; he said, already heading for the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s car pulled away while Brandon slipped into the back seat of his Maybach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In silence, the driver took the wheel and Eugene claimed the front seat, his eyes darting nervously to the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Follow them.&#34; A curt command broke the hush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon intended to keep watch, trailing close behind until Giffard and Millie went their separate ways.</p>
