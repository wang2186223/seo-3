                <p>As Brandon questioned Vivian in the Bentley,something else was brewing online-conversations about the live sound quality of &#34;Yesterday&#34; had started trending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s team caught it quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny frowned as he read through the comments,uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He typed a message to Vivian. &#34;We tried flagging the accounts at first, but they knew how to play the system. They just switched to new ones and brought in more people to psh the trend. It&#39;s already gained attention. If we start mass-reporting now, it&#39;ll only look like we&#39;re hiding something. What do you think we should do? I&#39;ve listed a few options...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was how their team usually worked-Johnny came up with the possible moves, and Vivian picked the one that fit her image best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Vivian made her choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Seville scrolled through the trending thread,pleased with how fast it had spread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was easy to shut things down when only a few people were talking. But what happened when the numbers kept growing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew this crowd-curious, nosy,always hungry for drama. He was waiting for someone to bring the truth forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, the conversation began to twist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You keep talking, but where&#39;s the proof?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. If there&#39;s no evidence, it&#39;s just noise. Rumors are easily spread these days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is clearly a Serena fan trying to pull Vivian down.They just want &#39;Yesterday&#39; to outshine &#39;Glimmer of Love.&#39; It&#39;s pathetic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| used to like Serena. But if this is how her fans act,she&#39;s lost me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This feels like a PR stunt. Probably Serena&#39;s team stirring things on purpose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian came on this show to inspire people who are suffering, to give them hope. And now she&#39;s getting attacked for being kind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoever&#39;s doing this has no conscience. Vivian&#39;s not even part of the competition, and still she&#39;s being</p>
                
                
                
                <p>dragged through the mud. It&#39;s just cruel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heavenly Melody was alroady a hit show. Add in the emotional weight of Vivian&#39;s illnoss, and paopla ward ready to defend hor at all costs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With everyone fooling for Vivian and no solid footage from the live show to say othorwisa, tho crowd naturally leaned in her favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville sat back, stunned. This wasn&#39;t what he&#39;d expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t even mentioned Vivian when he first questioned the audio quality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had just noticed that the online clips didn&#39;t sound like what he heard in person. But now? Now he was being labeled Serena&#39;s obsessed fan, hell-bent on destroying Vivian&#39;s image.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As more voices poured in, the direction of public opinion began to take shape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville was frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to explain he&#39;d never even heard the name Serena Ellsworth until today. She was new in the industry and wore a mask throughout the show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did he suddenly become her die-hard fan in everyone&#39;s story?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And to make things worse, he had always liked Vivian and thought her performance was equally beautiful.He never had anything against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is insane,&#34; he muttered. &#34;I can&#39;t let it go. They want proof? Fine. I don&#39;t believe for a second that out of all those people at the venue, not one person secretly recorded something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up,already scrolling through his contacts. He wasn&#39;t the type to sit quietly and watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He decided to make a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dialed one of his friends who had also been at the event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few moments of small talk, Seville casually asked him about his opinion on the stage performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His friend replied, &#34;Honestly? I thought &#39;Yesterday&#39;sounded amazing live. But when I watched the clips online later, it didn&#39;t hit the same.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were sure they were on the same page,Seville shared everything. &#34;Taylor, you know how l am.I can&#39;t just let this slide,&#34; he said. &#34;What I said online was true, but now they&#39;re calling me a Serena obsessed fan trying to attack Vivian. I&#39;m not okay with that. You helped me get in, so l figured  you might have a way. If no one&#39;s uploaded footage from the  live event yet, maybe there&#39;s a group chat or something? Somewhere people shared clips or talked during the show?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His friend thought for a moment, and then finally added him to a chat group. &#34;This is my ticket resale group,&#34; he warned. &#34;It&#39;s full of all kinds of people-some are legit, some aren&#39;t. Be careful. Don&#39;t say anything that could get the group shut down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, I owe you one,&#34; Seville said, already planning his next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the Bentley, Vivian was caught off guard by Brandon&#39;s question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand,&#34; she said, eyebrows pulling together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon looked at her, quiet. The silence made it hard for her to meet his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian looked down, pausing to think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really don&#39;t know what you mean, Brandon,&#34; she said,voice soft. &#34;I did speak to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced up again, her expression delicate, almnost unsure. &#34;I heard she&#39;d had a miscarriage recently and that she was still recovering. I just wanted to check on her-to see if she needed anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked, trying to read his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did she take it the wrong way?&#34; she said, worriedly trying to remember. &#34;I only mentioned her injuries and her... loss. Brandon, do you think she thought I was the one who told people? That&#39;s not what I meant at all.&#34;Vivian lifted her hand to her face, looking distressed.&#34;I only ever told you. No one else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon studied her closely. Everything she said made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face, her voice-it all fit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked genuinely regretful. Without waiting for him to speak, she pulled out her phone and typed a message to Serena, as if to prove her sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it really was a misunderstanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; Brandon said. &#34;I was just asking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him,there was Vivian-the woman he&#39;d once failed and still felt responsible for-and Serena, Charles &#39;rumored lover who had absolutely nothing to do with him.There was no need to push further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rain brushed lightly against the windows. The city outside looked hazy, the damp air making everything feel heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They rode in silence for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Vivian broke it. &#34;Brandon,&#34; she said softly,&#34;did you think I sang well today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did. But not as well as Serena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was his honest thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, instead of being completely honest, he just gave a short, low hum. &#34;Mm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian smiled at that. Then her smile trembled just slightly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With your approval,&#34; she said quietly, eyes glistening,&#34;I can leave without regrets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s brow tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned slightly, and then sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t talk like that,&#34; he said. &#34;Vivian, you&#39;re already remarkable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian reached out and took his hand. She didn&#39;t say anything more-just held it and smiled gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,they pulled up to Vivian Floral Design. Brandon walked her inside, helped her settle in, and returned to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Watson,where to next?&#34; Eugene asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t answer immediately. He was still watching Vivian through the window. His index finger tapped against the armrest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he said, &#34;Send a message. Tell Macauley to come see me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; Eugene replied, pulling out his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engine hummed back to life, and the car pulled away towards the Watson Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But a moment later, his face went pale. Sir-something&#39;s wrong. Macauley&#39;s missing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon turned sharply. &#34;Missing? Since when?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was just reported,&#34; Eugene said, voice quick and nervous. &#34;They say he disappeared a month ago. The team hid it from us, believing they could track him down before anyone noticed. We only found out because someone asked the right question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated and then added, &#34;After everything that happened, Macauley holds a deep grudge. He went back to his hometown, but life hasn&#39;t been good for him.If this turns into something serious...&#34;</p>
