                <p>Sunlight spilled through the window as Millie woke, greeted by a cloudless, brilliant sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused for a moment, taking in the crisp blue above the city, and gave a determined nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weather itself seemed to promise good fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today marked the long-awaited finals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the crack of dawn, chaos reigned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elaborate costumes and intricate hairstyles meant hours of work, so Millie arrived at the designer&#39;s studio well before schedule, determined to get every detail right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once her look was perfected, she slid into the backseat of the sedan and headed for the Heavenly Melody finals venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as they approached, Millie immediately sensed something off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she&#39;d even set foot out of the car, she spotted a dense crowd swelling outside the recording studio.The energy was electric-excited, noisy, maybe even tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From inside the vehicle, she could only catch snippets of sound, indistinct but urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara, ever practical, leaned forward and instructed the driver to pull over a little ways off. &#34;Serena, wait here,&#34; she said calmly. &#34;I&#39;ll go see what&#39;s going on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she slipped from the car, disappearing into the bustling crowd to investigate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara soon returned, her expression clouded with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should we try to drive straight in?&#34; she inquired, glancing anxiously at the driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A prickle of unease shot through Millie. She stualied Barbara, waiting for an explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara finally broke, lowering her voice. &#34;There are protesters up ahead-holding signs, making a scene...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She trailed off, but Millie didn&#39;t need the rest spelled out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not getting through that crowd. We&#39;ll have to come up with another plan,&#34; Millie replied, her tone decisive. &#34;They&#39;ve probably spotted our car already. If we push our way in and things get ugly...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left the warning unfinished. The implication hung in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One wrong move, and the finals would slip right through their fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, another car rolled past. Vivian&#39;s face pressed to the window, her eyes glittering with mischief.&#34;What&#39;s the holdup? Scared now?&#34; she sneered, a mischievous smile lighting her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara shot Vivian a venomous glare before getting in. She slammed the car door so hard the whole sedan shook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Millie urged the driver to pull away at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the car pulled away, a swarm of potesters surged to their former parking spot, shouting and waving signs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it!&#34; Barbara muttered a sharp curse when she spotted them in the mirror, instantly realizing Vivian had deliberately tipped them off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank God they&#39;d left in time-if they&#39;d hesitated even a second longer, they would have been completely surrounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara&#39;s lips curled into a sly grin. &#34;Well, look at that,&#34; she drawled, leaning forward. &#34;Vivian&#39;s little stunt actually played right.into our hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The uproar over here had drawn away nearly all the protesters, leaving the entrance to the recording studio wide open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their sedan coasted effortlessly through the gate, slipping past the chaos and pulling up next to Vivian&#39;s flashy car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara hopped out first and helped Millie from the back seat, just as Vivían&#39;s eyes landed on them.She stood frozen, too stunned to even react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara spun on her heel and flashed Vivian a wide, taunting grin, finishing it off with an exaggerated eye roll that only made Vivian&#39;s expression darken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s lips curled into a sneer. &#34;Bask in it wwhile you can, Serena. This is the last time you&#39;ll ever get to feel proud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie wasn&#39;t going to dignify that with a reply, but since it was the final round, she decided Vivian didn&#39;t deserve the satisfaction of silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned, catching the furious twist in her rival&#39;s features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a bold, unbothered smile, Millie answered, &#34;Don&#39;t worry-I plan to. And trust me, I&#39;m just getting started.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; Vivian&#39;s temper snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thinking about hitting her, huh?&#34; Before Vivian could barrel forward, Barbara and the makeup artist darted in front of Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious onlookers had already begun to gather, forcing Vivian to swallow her anger and rein in her temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All you ever do is talk big,&#34; she muttered under her breath, and then spun on her heel and marched away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd&#39;s attention lingered on Millie, scrutinizing her every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Daphne gave a derisive snort as she swept past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie paid them no mind and strode directly toward the backstage area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the spat was already blowing up across social media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The finals hadn&#39;t even kicked off, and the atmosphere was already crackling with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On top of the crowds protesting Serena, a growing swarm of spectators had gathered, hungry for the unfolding drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With anticipation building, everyone waited breathlessly/ for the live broadcast to begin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite nearly being hemmed in by the protesters outside, Millie still managed to slip backstage ahead of schedule. Inside, Daphne-unwilling to share even a corner of the space with Millie-had already retreated to a private lounge, leaving only a handful of staffers milling about behind the scenes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the contestants, judges and host all absent, the atmosphere backstage felt strangely deserted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some staff eyed Millie warily, their loyalties shifting according to each contestant&#39;s odds of winning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, no one ever approached her, and Millie found herself isolated in the middle of a wide, empty stretch of floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Barbara tried to gather information, she ran straight into a wall of chilly indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold-shoulder treatment reeked of Vivian&#39;s doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, their earlier confrontation had struck a nerve, and Vivian wasn&#39;t finished retaliating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was at that awkward moment that Jayceon and his siblings swept in and took in the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon, never one to hide his feelings, barreled straight toward Millie with a thunderous scowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Serena, crush it out there! I&#39;ve got your back!&#34; he hollered, his voice echoing off the high backstage ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trailing just behind, Adriana rolled her eyes and promptly reached over to twist her brother&#39;s ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you not? Don&#39;t startle her before she goes on stage,&#34; she groaned, barely suppressing her own exasperation at his theatrics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Myron trailed after them, giving Millie a warm nod and an easy smile when their eyes met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adriana&#39;s voice softened as she turned to Millie. &#34;We debated coming back here, honestly. People love to talk, you know. But Jayceon&#39;s been a huge fan and the public already knows that, so it&#39;s not exactly a secret.We figured,why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon bobbed his head in agreement, grinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True to form, Myron stayed mostly in the background, his expression quietly supportive, eyes shining with quiet amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie glanced at the three of them, a flicker of envy stirring at the effortless closeness of the Elliott family.Even Barbara, who typically kept her distance, lingered nearby, visibly admiring their camaraderie. As Charles&#39; assistant, she understood all too well the undercurrents of conflict that ran through the Evans family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie felt immune to rumors and unfazed by the noisy protest outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What truly mattered were the people willing to stand beside her now-she cherished them all the more for it.Though the Elliott family already knew the truth, Millie&#39;s chest tightened with gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A genuine smile spread across her face as she stood. &#34;Thank you,&#34;she said, her voice steady, her eyes alight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adriana&#39;s lips curved into an easy smile, her eyes lighting with unspoken understanding as she met Millie&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t wait to see what you&#39;ll do out there tonight,&#34; Myron offered, his tone gentle but sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie hesitated briefly, and then returned a polite nod, her expression softening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adriana shot Myron a playful look before turning to Millie. &#34;We&#39;ll go grab our seats. Don&#39;t keep us waiting too long,&#34;she teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie smiled, her shoulders relaxing a fraction. &#34;I&#39;ll do my best,&#34; she promised, a spark of warmth in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the Elliott siblings disappeared down the hallway, the mood backstage subtly shifted. The once chilly staff now greeted Barbara&#39;s questions with a hint of warmth, their attitudes less frosty than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear-the Elliott name carried weight, and their support meant something, even if few backstage truly believed Serena could win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And even if she somehow did win, in their eyes, her reputation had long ruined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Elliott family&#39;s appearance seemed less about support and more a reflection of Jayceon&#39;s open admiration for Serena-or perhaps a curiosity to see if her talent could eclipse the taint of scandal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the Elliott family made their exit, the remaining contestants and the judges trickled in, almost every one deliberately steering clearof Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She noticed their avoidance but simply brushed it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out in the audience, Brandon kept glancing at the empty seat beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several days ago, he&#39;d mentioned the show and asked Millie if she planned to attend. She&#39;d promised she would, so he&#39;d sent her a message with the details and saved a spot for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, as the minutes ticked by and the crowd settled, he couldn&#39;t help but wonder if she would actually show.</p>
