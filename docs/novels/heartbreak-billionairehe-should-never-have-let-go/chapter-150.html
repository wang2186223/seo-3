                <p>Charles looked at Oakley and suddenly let out a quiet chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley stared at him, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know something?&#34; Charles said, his voice surprisingly calm for someone with a reputation for being hot-tempered.&#34;You and Reuben misjudged me and completely underestimated Serena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley burst out laughing, as though he&#39;d just heard a ridiculous joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you even talking about, Charles?&#34; he said, thinking back over the past few days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the fourth live broadcast of the show, Oakley and Vivian had fallen out. But she eventually came back with a show of sincerity and proved herself capable of turning the charity fraud accusation against Serena into a weapon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley accepted her back and agreed to take charge of everything related to the Evans family for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still trying to fight back?&#34; he said. &#34;Remember that meeting when you were cornered? If it hadn&#39;t been for Brandon&#39;s move and Jayceon stepping in as Serena&#39;s fan, she would&#39;ve been forced to quit the competition immediately. And now, with Reuben and me watching closely, there&#39;s no way you can manipulate the auction records to clear her name. Even if a donation appears after, we&#39;ll twist it and ruin your reputation even more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley studied Charles carefully. But Charles only met his gaze with a faint, unreadable smile that made Oakley uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Charles remained silent, something about him unsettled Oakley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He replayed the recent events in his mind all over again, glancing at the woman on stage, her face still hidden behind the plaster mask, and then back at Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Serena&#39;s reputation is already in shambles,&#34; Oakley said. &#34;Forget the accusations of sleeping her way to the top-if the charity fraud is confirmed, there&#39;s no coming back from that. I know your people have been trying to clean things up, but it&#39;s pointless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley&#39;s heart was pounding now as he spoke. A small doubt crept in. Could Serena actually be innocent?He quickly dismissed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The charity auction had been organized by the Evans family. Despite their internal struggles, Oakley and Reuben had personally overseen the verificätion process. Charles might have been able to keep Serena&#39;s identity a secret so far, but he couldn&#39;t have messed with the donation records and fooled both of themn at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley was certain Serena hadn&#39;t placed a bidor made any donation that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So what was Charles playing at? Was he only bluffing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After going over it again, Oakley relaxed and scoffed. &#34;You&#39;re insane, Charles. Still clinging to some impossible miracle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles just shrugged and turned back to the stage. &#34;Think what you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His only responsibility tonight was to keep tabs on Oakley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled faintly. &#34;Maybe a miracle really will happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Backstage, the atmosphere was tense as Serena performed under the stage lights. Everyone watched with different expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just days ago, Daphne had publicly lashed out at Serena-an incident no one had forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among the guests attending the recording,&#39;all were music professionals or experienced contestants-except for Vivian, though most assumed she was,too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, as Serena performed, people exchanged looks. Some couldn&#39;t help glancing at Daphne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daphne clenched her jaw but sat upright, trying to appear unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Serena&#39;s performance was brilliant, it wouldn&#39;t change the public backlash. The scandal was too big.She would still be disqualified and rejected. At least, that was what Daphne told herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, somewhere deep inside, she felt a small sense of relief that the charity fraud allegations had ruined Serena&#39;s chances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On stage, the woman in the plaster mask kept singing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her movements shifted fluidly from one dance style to another, like a statue newly brought to life,experimenting with all possible artistic formns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was chaos. Beauty. A fusion of styles that defied labels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the music built, she lifted the microphone that looked like a sculptor&#39;s chisel toward her own mask, the only part of her body still uncarved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audience held its breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a month now, speculation about Serena&#39;s real identity had stirred conversation online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heavenly Melody only accepted performers under the age of twenty-five.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, despite endless searching, no one had been able to match Serena&#39;s voice, talent, or style to anyone in that age group. This was specially surprising given how under scrutiny she was after her explosive third stage performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her musical skill. was undeniable. Her stagepresence, unmatched. Even when rumors spread during the fourth round that Evans Entertainment was backing her, her talent shut them down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, this mysterious Serena pointed the chisel-shaped microphone at her mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who had once been chanting for her to be disqualified fell silent, staring at the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ding!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp, clear sound echoed-the sound of the sculptor&#39;s chisel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small piece of plaster fell from her chin, revealing her red lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audience finally remembered to breathe-only to hold their breath again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the judges&#39; section, Vivian&#39;s fingers clenched tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t understand what Serena was trying to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she showed her face, how would that change anything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian and Oakley had gone over everything multiple times. On the day of the charity auction, Serena&#39;s bid number hadn&#39;t been used at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d even explored the far-fetched scenario of Serena and Charles being secretly married, which might&#39;ve made his purchase count as hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Oakley had checked. Charles was still legally single.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if they&#39;d married afterward, they could easily twist the story and call it a cover-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced down, checking the screen under the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a message from Oakley.&#34;Something feels wrong. What is Serena doing? Should we stop her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought for a moment and replied, &#34;Whatever she&#39;s planning, we stick to the original plan.This time,we&#39;ll drag both Serena and Charles down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still...I have a really bad feeling about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t trust me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not that, Just... something feels off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was about to reply again when her gaze shifted toward Brandon in the audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was frowning, eyes fixed on the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That strange sense of familiarity had returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment he first saw this masked woman,he&#39;d felt it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who was she?</p>
