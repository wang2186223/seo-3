                <p>Brandon&#39;s face remained unreadable,his gaze lowered,making it impossible to decipher what he was thinking</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Charles was about to lose his patience and walk off, Brandon spoke quietly, his voice barely loud enough for only them to hear. &#34;Millie said the two of you were just friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles gave him a sideways glance. &#34;And?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon looked up. &#34;Take care of her. As a friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Charles could respond with his usual sarcasm,Brandon added, &#34;Please. If you need anything...let me know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles blinked, momentarily caught off guard. His reply, brimming with irritation, died on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a short silence, he huffed, &#34;I don&#39;t need you to tell me that,&#34; and stormed off, muttering under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he disappeared backstage, Charles couldn&#39;t help but frown. What the hell was Brandon playing at?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he trying to balance Vivian and Millie? Waiting for Vivian to die before crawling back to Millie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made him recoil. He gagged dramatically,shaking his head in disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stood silently, his eyes trailing after Charles,his expression unchanged</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fourth live broadcast of Heavenly Melody was electric with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the semifinals, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd buzzed not just because of the stakes but also because Elliott Group had entered the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone already knew Brandon was backing Vivian,but Elliott Group? That was a whole different league.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their grip on the luxury and fashion markets was massive. If one of the contestants caught their eye tonight, the doors to the upper echelon of fame would fly open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that opportunity was right here, right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The six semifinalists knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They pulled out every trick they had and pushed their talents to the edge, determined to land in the top three-or at the very least, leave an impression on the Elliott family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd erupted in cheers after each amazing performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had drawn the fourth slot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the third contestant wrapped up their performance,her phone buzzed. It was a message sent to Serena From Vivian. &#34;Serena, I gave you a chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s eyes flicked toward the judges&#39; table. Vivian sat there, smiling. A smile that said checkmate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was it. Vivian was finally making her move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the commercial break began and the stage cleared,Barbara came rushing over, nearly stumbling in her heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy,&#34; Millie said, steadying her. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara hesitated,glancing around nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There wasn&#39;t much time. The voting segment followed directly after the performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara felt like this was Serena&#39;s last chance to clear her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wordlessly, she handed over her tablet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A headline blared across the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SCANDAL: Serena Ellsworth and Evans Entertainment CEO Charles Evans Accused of Vote-Rigging!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>#HeavenlyMelodyScandal</p>
                
                
                
                <p>#SerenaRiggedVotes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie scanned the article. &#34;Serena Ellsworth is a signed artist under Evans Entertainment,&#34; it began. &#34;So of course they&#39;d stack the odds in her favor. Rigging votes in the show? It was only a matter of time. But this show was supposed to be about fairness and raw talent. If Serena wins unfairly, it&#39;ll be a slap in the face to every other contestant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara leaned in. &#34;You have to address this during the voting segment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded sharply. &#34;Tell Charles... that talent speaks louder than rumors. The rest can wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34; Barbara dashed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stagehand called her name. It was time. Millie took a deep breath and stepped forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the audience, Jayceon had his phone out,showing his siblings the article.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is sabotage. Serena doesn&#39;t need to cheat. She&#39;s got talent,&#34; he growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His siblings nodded in agreement, scowling as they scrolled through the smear campaign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Brandon frowned as he caught wind of the rumors. His eyes drifted to the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lights dimmed. Commercials rolled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie took her place center stage, staring out into the judging panel. Vivian was smiling smugly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When their eyes met, Vivian mouthed two words-&#34;Beg me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie let out a soft, humorless laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian still didn&#39;t get it. In the face of real talent, all the manipulation in the world wouldn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let the rumors swirl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth would sing louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, please welcome Serena Ellsworth performing &#39;Journey&#39;!&#34; the host announced when the commercial break ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lights slowly lifted. Serena stood beneath them,dressed in a flowy dress-elegant, romantic,her mask delicate and shimmering. In her hand was a gleaming clarinet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brought the instrument to her lips and began to play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle melody unfolded, rich with emotion. Then came the vocals, soft and lyrical, telling the story of a traveler swept up in a dream of romance, joy, and freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stage transformed with her song: swirling mist,golden leaves, and delicate lighting created a dreamscape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audience leaned in, smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this was a fiercely competitive stage. This alone wasn&#39;t enough to dim the rest of the competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Discussions were raging online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is it? Pretty song, sure,but where&#39;s the technique?It&#39;s the semifinals!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew it. Overhyped. Everyone else brought their A -game, and she&#39;s giving us a lullaby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of people guided the discussion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian watched Serena&#39;s gentle performance, her grin growing smug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re done,&#34; she mouthed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then the lights dimmed again. Soon, a new scene bloomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ancient scroll-like projections unfurled across the stage. The music shifted. The lights warmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena reappeared in ornate historical garb, her mask more intricate, and this time, she held a lyre.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She began with a few soft notes, the lights following her lead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She struck the strings hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound cracked through the room like lightning.The tempo soared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her masterful voice followed. It was powerful-captivating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The performance shifted from whimsical to legendary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps filled the auditorium. &#34;What a beautiful performance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her performance continued as the crowd held their breath.Each stroke,each vocal, invoked a feeling from the audience.</p>
