                <p>The live show was still ongoing, but the Internet was already buzzing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heavenly Melody had become a sensation, drawing a wave of attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The live stream audience was just a fraction. Many who missed it watched the edited clips instead.Serena had made a strong impression in the first round, but her second-round performance felt underwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, thanks to the trending clips released by Evans Entertainment&#39;s official website, the views were skyrocketing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the live stream sparked the first wave of attention, this was the second-wider, louder, and far more explosive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most people didn&#39;t have the time to sit through full live broadcasts, so the edited versions became their go-to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more views poured in, the louder the chatter grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my goodness, this is amazing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;ve been watching the edited versions. Everyone stepped up in round two. I thought they were holding back in the first round, letting her shine. Didn&#39;t realize it was the audio and video quality messing things up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the second round, her song didn&#39;t focus on showing off singing technique like the others did. Plus the tampered quality, she looked pretty average.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only voted for her because of her songwriting. I gave my other votes elsewhere. Honestly,I regret it now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So who&#39;s behind this? I don&#39;t buy the &#39;technical issues&#39; excuse. I mean, why is she the only victim?Someone needs to dig deeper!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. This has to be looked into properly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s side was instantly flooded with criticism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People began questioning her, demanding answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, she used the live broadcast as an excuse to delay her response and buy time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the apartment, Seville and Alexia were celebrating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hahaha, this is so satisfying! I can finally breathe again!&#34; Seville jumped to his feet. &#34;Everyone was attacking me before.Look at them now-apologizing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, some even posted screenshots of your old comments. It&#39;s hilarious,&#34; Alexia said with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville was surprised that people had acted so fast to save those comments before they were deleted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,they had become proof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;m sure most of the ones insulting me before aren&#39;t the same ones defending me now,&#34; Seville said, narrowing his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia laughed. &#34;Still, clearing your name is what matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely!&#34; Seville broke into a goofy anime-style celebration dance in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might&#39;ve been chubby and a bit of a homebody, but he moved with surprising agility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia burst out laughing beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unseen by them, Sheridan, sitting in another chair, smiled quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Heavenly Melody live show venue...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside Millie&#39;s private room, Charles looked pleased as things started swinging in their favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie stayed calm. She quietly watched Vivian return to her seat on the live stream screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s return meant only one thing-she had a counterplan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, it was time to see her next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s PR team wasn&#39;t one to take lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, a new narrative soon began to spread online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is everyone blaming Vivian? She&#39;s not even a contestant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. She&#39;s just a judge. Maybe people are barking up the wrong tree.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They say Vivian used Brandon&#39;s influence to target Serena, but think about it-if she really had that power, Serena would&#39;ve been erased without a trace by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone else is behind this, and they&#39;re trying to frame Vivian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The argument was clever, flipping the logic in Vivian&#39;s favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the average viewer, it sounded reasonable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Seville and Alexia stayed active, pushing out responses and listing their points.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all part of a well-planned strategy. Slowly, public opinion started tilting back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, besides Vivian, no one else had a reason to target Serena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that was the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,professionals from the music industry joined in, analyzing Serena&#39;s performances and praising her talent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The online buzz only grew louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian saw it all-and her jaw clenched in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Johnny&#39;s team started working with her, she had never taken such a hit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even handling Millie had been a walk in the park. But now Serena-this nobody-was proving to be a real thorn in her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Vivian couldn&#39;t let her frustration show on camera. She signaled the crew not to film her and quickly lowered her head to text Oakley and Johnny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oakley ignored her completely. He had his own mess to deal with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny suggested they leak Serena&#39;s scandals-like her secret relationship with Charles and her miscarriage-to distract the public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian refused. &#34;That&#39;s my ace. I need to keep it for leverage. Besides, now that the audio tampering is almost confirmed, using that info would backfire. Netizens will think we&#39;re slandering her out of spite.We&#39;d lose the advantage and risk a backlash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny agreed-but there was nothing more he could do for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to clear my name and steady my public image first,&#34; Vivian typed back quickly. &#34;I&#39;ll come up with something. Wait for my message,&#34; she added after thinking it through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian glanced toward Serena&#39;s lounge, her eyes filled with hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she reopened Oakley&#39;s chat-but still no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, she got up and stepped into the staff corridor to call Eugene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long before Eugene answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Simpson?&#34; his voice came through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eugene, I need your help. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen what&#39;s going on online,&#34; Vivian said weakly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene confirmed he had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I honestly don&#39;t know who&#39;s behind this. But now, everything&#39;s being pinned on me. Doesn&#39;t the Watson Group have ties to the entertainment industry? You might know some people. Could you give me a hand?&#34; she asked in a low,pitiful voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before now, Vivian had only used Brandon&#39;s name as a shield, relying entirely on Johnny&#39;s team. This was the first time she&#39;d ever directly asked Watson Group for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting the Watson Group involved meant more complications. Once tied to them, she wouldn&#39;t have the freedom she used to. She also risked some of her secrets coming to light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, she had no choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it was all because of Serena. Vivian believed Serena was the reason that she had been pushed this far.</p>
