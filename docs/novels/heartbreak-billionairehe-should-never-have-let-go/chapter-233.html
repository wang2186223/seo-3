                <p>A rush of intense hatred tore through Brandon, and his stare carried the chill of a man ready to kill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian faltered for a split second, thrown off balance.How had Brandon figured out her depression was nothing but an act? Did that mean he&#39;d also uncovered the truth about her fake stomach cancer?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian kept her eyes down, terrified that even a glance at Brandon might betray the secrets she was hiding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak up!&#34; Brandon&#39;s voice erupted like a whip,sharp and cold, with a dangerous edge that made her flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s chest tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t prepared for this kind of confrontation, so she blurted out through tears, &#34;It wasn&#39;t me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled the needle free and broke down completely, her sobs wild and unrestrained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t me!&#34; She shouted, her tone spiraling into frantic hysteria. &#34;I don&#39;t know who&#39;s after me,Brandon,but someone&#39;s trying to ruin me! Is it Millie?Eugene? Or somebody else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cries grew louder, the desperation in them believable enough to pass for real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon&#39;s eyes stayed cold, his expression unmoved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, if you think I&#39;m lying, then let me die...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She twisted on the hospital bed, making a wild attempt to slam her head into the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Brandon didn&#39;t move, his gaze frozen on her like ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s mind raced. Should she actually go through with it? Did she really have to crash into the wall now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on,&#34; Brandon taunted, his lips curling. &#34;Weren&#39;t you about to slam into the wall and end it all? Why aren&#39;t you doing it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone dripped with mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian braced herself, ready to give her head a light tap against the wall and fake a collapse, only for a sudden knock to interrupt her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief flooded Vivian, and she quickly wiped at her wet cheeks before glancing toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same attending physician from earlier stepped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching at the chance, she blurted, &#34;Please,doctor! You have to help me, l-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the doctor&#39;s face hardened. &#34;Vivian, I&#39;m done covering for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s smirk deepened as Vivian froze in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; Vivian snapped, pointing a trembling finger at</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the doctor, her eyes blazing and her words momentarily stuck in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop pretending already,&#34; the doctor said, darting a wary glance at Brandon. &#34;Mr. Watson&#39;s been aware for some time. I&#39;m just an ordinary man, and I can&#39;t afford to take risks. Vivian, whatever&#39;s going on between you two, settle it yourselves. Leave me out of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every part of him screamed a desire to cut ties completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s fury burned hotter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze flicked back to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon still wore that mocking smile, his dark eyes cutting into her like blades.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who paid you off to frame me?&#34; Vivian snapped,turning around to glare at the doctor with seething accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor, however, came prepared. Without a word, he pulled a small recorder from his pocket and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hit play, letting the sound of their earlier scheming fill the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the recording ended, he handed the device straight to Brandon. &#34;Here&#39;s the original copy. I&#39;ve given you everything. I&#39;m out of this now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t wait for a response, slipping out and shutting the door behind him with a sharp bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon turned the recorder over in his hand before pressing the button again. Vivian&#39;s own voice spilled out again-&#34;Just diagnose me with depression, say l can&#39;t handle stress, especially from Millie, and that l need Brandon&#39;s care and attention...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, the color drained from Vivian&#39;s face for real, stripping away the painted paleness her makeup had created.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stopped the playback and raised the recorder as evidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got anything to add?&#34; he asked with a cutting smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or are you going to tell me it&#39;s all fake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s lips parted as if to speak, but nothing came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re finally smart enough not to pile on another lie,&#34; Brandon said coldly. &#34;This is the original recording. It can be verified by voiceprint identification.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s voice went frigid, almost daring her to answer.&#34;Vivian, what else do you have to say now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian stared at Brandon, knowing the act was over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no point hiding anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; she admitted. &#34;I made it all up. I was never depressed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Brandon&#39;s hand clamped down on her shoulder, pushing her back until she hit the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes burned red, and his jaw was locked tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would you do something like this?&#34; The words came out low and strained, forced through clenched teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t she the one who always claimed to be gentle and sincere?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t she insisted she only had six months left to live, saying all she wanted was to spend that time with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had ended his marriage to Millie and stayed by her side. So why was Vivian still lying, still going after Millie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Vivian only laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Vivian&#39;s lips twisted into a smirk. &#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious? If I didn&#39;t pull all of this, Brandon, would you have given me more of your time? Even with me supposedly dying, you still kept your distance. I had to push further, to make you see me as a patient, to make you remember what you promised.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s gaze locked on Brandon&#39;s as her voice rose.&#34;You swore, Brandon. These last six months, you&#39;d be with me, you&#39;d love me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| already left her!&#34; Brandon&#39;s voice thundered with</p>
                
                
                
                <p>fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you still won&#39;t marry me!&#34; she shot back. &#34;You won&#39;t even touch me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breathing turned sharp and heavy with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you send Eugene to ask how I got into Serenity Villa? Fine, I&#39;ll tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s glare cut straight through Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each word landed with deliberate weight. &#34;Simple.I guessed the password. I went through every number I could think of, yours, hers, even the ones tied to both of you. The date that signified Watson Group&#39;s complete transformation. Your wedding day. Millie&#39;s birthday. Even dates I dug up from other sources, like when you two were in Flesta.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s glare burned with pure malice toward Millie.&#34;And guess what? The front door&#39;s code is her birthday. The code to the small bathroom? The day you married her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mouth curled in contempt. &#34;You swore you&#39;d love</p>
                
                
                
                <p>me-and this is what you call keeping that promise?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivian!&#34; Brandon&#39;s voice explodedd like a crack of thunder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did it intentionally.&#34; Vivian straightened her back and met his eyes without flinching. &#34;I walked in there on purpose, went live on camera just to humiliate her,to show everyone that I, Vivian, have taken her place as Mrs. Watson, and she&#39;s nothing but a discarded woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s hand dug harder into Vivian&#39;s shoulder the pressure so fierce it felt as if he wanted to snap her in two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So all those words before were just a performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every move had been about going after Millie, about hurting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A discardded woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d never let Vivian degrade her like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Vivian pressed on. Suddenly her lips trembled</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her eyes glistened red, and the tears came on cue.&#34;Brandon, I know I crossed the line, but | couldn&#39;t stop myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once more, she slipped into her victim act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I envy her for having your love, while I gave you everything and still couldn&#39;t win your heart. I know l made mistakes...&#34; Her voice cracked as she sobbed.&#34;I won&#39;t be jealous of her anymore, Brandon. Just...don&#39;t leave me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all calculated, carefully chosen emotions, a few undeniable truths twisted into a different story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted him to believe her love had blinded her,that her missteps came from passion, and that she was ready to change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stared at Vivian, a hollow laugh escaping him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had wronged Millie time and time again for a woman like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, his self-loathing deepened, cursing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>himself for ever believing Vivian could be kind and gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The red in his eyes deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t raise my hand against women,&#34; Brandon said,loosening his grip on Vivian&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But if pretending to be depressed is what you enjoy...&#34; His tone dropped to ice. &#34;Then you can live with the real thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Vivian could even process the words,Brandon&#39;s gaze had shifted, and he was already walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene was waiting just outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon murmured a brief instruction to Eugene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a firm nod, Eugene replied, &#34;Understood. I&#39;ll make sure Miss Simpson gets a true taste of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also...&#34; Eugene hesitated, and then pulled out a folder and handed it over to Brandon. &#34;Mr. Watson, I just found this in the archive. It&#39;s Mrs. W- Miss</p>
