                <p>Oakley let out a cold laugh before turning and walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stayed where she was, meeting the reporters&#39;eyes with a calm, polite smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd buzzed with conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far off, Brandon sat in his car, staring at the storefront in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze was thoughtful and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered the early days of the Watson Group&#39;s transformation. Millie had stood beside him then, offering advice and pitching in wherever she could. But now, all her effort went toward someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon looked away, eyes dimming, and quietly told Eugene todrive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie continued to answer the reporters&#39; questions,unaware that a car had pulled up behind her. Inside sat Myron,silently watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she had agreed to spend time with him recently, Myron never saw love in her eyes-only the friendly warmth and trust of a business partner or a friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed to enjoy the surprises he gave her, but the spark in her expression never lasted. There was no sign of him in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Brandon no longer held her affection,her heart was still empty. Myron couldn&#39;t help but wonder how he could truly earn a place in Millie&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s too soon,&#34; Myron whispered. &#34;I&#39;ll have to take it slow. Step by step. At least for now, her heart belongs to no one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was something. She had agreed to give it a chance-to get to know him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind wandered to one distant day in the past at the port. Millie had carefully chosen spices while the salesperson patiently introduced each one to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had smiled so warmly and said, &#34;My boyfriend has trouble sleeping. I want something to help him rest better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could still see her eyes then-bright and full of love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the snowy night. She had run into another man&#39;s arms without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, Brandon, you still have me,&#34; she had said. &#34;I&#39;ll stay by your side, even if the whole world turns against you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that time, Myron himself had just been betrayed by someone he trusted. He had barely escaped with his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only those who&#39;ve been betrayed know what truly matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron closed his eyes, hiding the shadows in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he opened them again, his face had returned to its usual calm and graceful look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie noticed him approaching and gave a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myron,&#34; she greeted him. It still felt unfamiliar on her tongue, but she knew one day it wouldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Elliott Group&#39;s new Blue series was an undeniable success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to strong marketing and Oakley&#39;s failed attempts to stir trouble, the launch attracted massive attention and plenty of interested buyers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s clever promotional strategies had already pulled in a wave of orders. Many customers were planning to return that evening when the store&#39;s lighting would be at its best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The store was also packed. A large promotional poster of Millie hung nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wore a vivid blue dress, a dazzling gemstone necklace, and matching sapphire earrings. Her hair flowed freely around her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The setup didn&#39;t perfectly match the promo video,but the sapphire around her neck clearly resembled the Heart of the Ocean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The campaign also featured a song called Blue,written and composed by Eva, and performed by Millie as the brand ambassador.However, the single was released under Eva&#39;s name. Millie&#39;s voice sounded like Eva&#39;s, but distinct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online chatter speculated Eva had started imitating Millie&#39;s singing style.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously, when Vivian released her revamped Glimmer of Love, Eva had been accused of seizing her moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no one could deny the success of the Blue series.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eva&#39;s single had also taken off, quickly climbing into the top ten on the new songs chart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By evening, a new entertainment poll popped up online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question was simple-Millie or Vivian?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each person could vote once per day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were no prizes, but that didn&#39;t stop the public from jumping in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to the success of the Blue launch event,Millie&#39;s votes surged, leaving Vivian far behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian was livid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All this over some mid-range gemstone products?&#34;she fumed inside her studio. &#34;Even if she gets a cut from her contract, how much could it be? Does she really think she can surpass me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paced the floor in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Eva-she&#39;s refused me but then joined forces with Millie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her caregiver, sensing trouble, spoke up hesitantly.&#34;Eva&#39;s signed with Evans Entertainment. Isn&#39;t it normal for her to collaborate with Millie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian shot her a glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver went quiet. Vivian&#39;s expression turned calculating and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Eva and Millie were working together,they were now tied to the same fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was sometimes hard to target one person. But with two, there were more opportunities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could now easily use Eva&#39;s scandals to get to Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had long suspected Eva was holding out for a better offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had noticed the way Eva watched Charles while still entertaining her team. Eva was probably waiting for Charles to make the next move back then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe the collaboration with Millie had come as a perk from Charles&#39; side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea settled her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Today&#39;s success wasn&#39;t even yours, Millie,&#34; she muttered. &#34;Myron handed it to you. Don&#39;t think you can outshine me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a private dining room, glasses clinked together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cheers!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another celebration was underway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, all the Elliott siblings were present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari had passed her hospital checkup and could be discharged,though she still needed care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone had shown up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew you could pull it off, Millie!&#34; Alexia beamed.&#34;You have no idea-so many of our coworkers were saying today they wanted to buy what you were endorsing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giffard took a long drink and nodded. &#34;Same in my department. The guys are talking about buying them for their girlfriends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter rippled around the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one seemed happier than Charles. He stood in the middle of the room, laughing heartily with his hands on his hips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, I think Oakley&#39;s lost his mind,&#34; he said.&#34;He tried to sabotage Millie. Look how that turned out. Totally blew up in his face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Millie, grinning. &#34;When he came crawling back, I gave him a real roasting. Grandpa even chewed him out for embarrassing himself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He deserved it,&#34; Jayceon added, and everyone burst out laughing.</p>
