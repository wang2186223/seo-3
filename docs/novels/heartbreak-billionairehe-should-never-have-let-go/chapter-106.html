                <p>At that moment, Millie sensed something odd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening? Who are these people? Why are they helping us all of a sudden?&#34; Barbara asked,confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new,unknown force had suddenly appeared online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just minutes, all the earlier rumors vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should we keep going?&#34; Charles asked quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The result was already clear. There was no need to push further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t care much about publicity. With her talent,as long as nothing unexpected happened, she could rise on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Vivian had been after her from the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First,Vivian and Oakley had reduced the quality of her videos. Then they tried to drag her name through the mud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville had told her they even started spreading vile rumors, claiming she had seduced the entire Heavenly Melody production team to get ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was cruel and disgusting-plain slut-shaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie wasn&#39;t the type to sit back and take it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, her talent spoke louder than any lie. The rumors didn&#39;t stick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,this sudden support...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie frowned. It felt overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who do you think it is?&#34; Charles asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to find out. Let&#39;s look into it,&#34; Millie replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Vivian sent a message to Johnny. lost control. Hold off on the miscarriage story-save it as a backup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, the rankings for the fourth round of Heavenly Melody were released.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena took the top spot without question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others followed in their places.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The round ended quietly, though the tension still lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone left in an orderly line</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie was about to leave too. But backstage, as she walked past Vivian, Vivian suddenly reached for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie quickly pulled her hand back,avoiding the touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for Vivian&#39;s terminal illness and the crowd watching, Millie might&#39;ve slapped her right there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t think you&#39;ve won, Serena,&#34; Vivian hissed in a rough voice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should worry about yourself,&#34; Millie said coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her, Barbara scoffed,&#34;Yeah, Serena has better things to do. Step aside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara&#39;s attitude had changed completely. She used to admire Vivian. But after everything she&#39;d seen,Vivian disgusted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; Vivian snapped, glaring at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara stood firm. She looked Vivian straight in the eye. &#34;Everyone online is asking who keeps targeting Serena,and guess who&#39;s their prime suspect? Instead of throwing threats here, maybe focus on yourself,Miss Simpson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned and walked off with Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian clenched her fists, trying not to explode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Internet was indeed already buzzing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People were discussing it without any prompting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s too strange. Serena&#39;s the target every time.Who did she offend? That last rumor was awful. If the public didn&#39;t already respect her, it could&#39;ve ruined her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One or two incidents could be coincidence. But this had gone on from round one to round four.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, fingers pointed at Oakley. But Oakley didn&#39;t plan to take the fall for Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He posted a video from the hospital, showing himself being treated by the nurse. The caption read, &#34;Not your guy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked beaten and pitiful in the video with all those bruises-but also kind of funny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were full of complaint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumor had it he&#39;d been slammed to the floor in the power room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharp-eyed netizens guessed he&#39;d tried to cut the power and got stopped by Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People still had doubts about him, but they were fading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, suspicion turned to Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Oakley, she was the only one with enough backing-thanks to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It all added up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian couldn&#39;t help but feel restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought she had everything under control. She had so much dirt on Serena. But it still slipped through her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She figured out two reasons why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First, she had been pulled away by blackmailers at the worst moment-she missed her chance to strike back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Second, an unexpected force had stepped in and changed everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to Johnny, even Serena&#39;s team didn&#39;t know who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian stared after Serena&#39;s fading figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena had slipped away again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Vivian couldn&#39;t dwell on it now. She had her own mess to clean up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes reddened as she walked toward Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Millie,Barbara,and Charles reached the RV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There,the Elliott siblings were waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon ran up, beaming. &#34;You&#39;re incredible, Serena!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You amaze me every time. I&#39;m your biggest fan now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adriana smiled and quickly tugged him back so he wouldn&#39;t overwhelm Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron stood off to the side, watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,an idea hit Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused and said, &#34;The online rumors...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t finsh. She wasn&#39;t sure yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, it was Myron,&#34; Jayceon answered before she could ask. &#34;I helped too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie blinked, surprised. Her eyes turned to Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elliott Group sponsors the show. You&#39;re the biggest draw-can&#39;tlet them drag your name through the mud,&#34;Myron explained simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It all made sense now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Elliott Group stepped in, there&#39;d been no outside help. But the day after they joined, things changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was logical. No one wanted to waste their investment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Millie said, sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adriana gave a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon huffed, &#34;You&#39;re super talented. I don&#39;t get those people! Why bring nonsense into a talent show?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, after a short pause, he peeked between Charles and Serena. &#34;You and Charles...&#34; he asked in a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie almost laughed. He was like a curious golden retriever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Charles and I are just friends-and business partners.The rumors are nonsense,&#34; Millie replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles nodded. &#34;Yes, we&#39;re just friends. And there are..other reasons we can&#39;t talk about yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did have feelings for Millie. But she clearly didn&#39;t feel the same. He didn&#39;t want people getting the wrong idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,hehe... Ow, Adriana!&#34; Jayceon yelped when his sister smacked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ignore him. He&#39;s a goof,&#34; Adriana said to Serena with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t mind. Jayceon was just young and curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded lightly to them, and Myron gave a small nod in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The siblings soon left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a well-timed meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie turned to board the RV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just then, a hand pressed against the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up. Brandon stood there, lips tight,eyes deep and searching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at her as if trying to see beneath her mask.</p>
