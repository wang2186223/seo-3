                <p>Millie shook her head. She didn&#39;t share the details with the Elliott siblings, only saying she needed to leave</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron paused. &#34;Where are you going? I&#39;ll drive you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at him. &#34;Watson Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He studied her for a moment, and then gave a silent nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the car stopped outside the Watson Group building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go up with you,&#34; Myron offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need,&#34; Millie replied. &#34;I&#39;ve got this.&#34; She didn&#39;t want to complicate things any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind was already racing. The six gemstones were her key to winning this bet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Egbert... he never played by the rules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to figure out his angle-quietly, without revealing her own</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron nodded. &#34;I&#39;ll wait in the parking lot then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She agreed without hesitation and got out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron drove down to park, his usual warmth vanishing as he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel.He then pulled out his phone and made a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few rings,someone answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to do something for me...&#34; he said and then issued a series of instructions before hanging up.He looked through the windshield toward the Watson Group building, eyes focused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs,Millie stepped into the CEO&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stood near his desk, his expression dark. As she walked in,he tossed a toy gun onto the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side of the room, Egbert approached with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie. It&#39;s been a long time,&#34; he said, giving her a once-over. &#34;You&#39;ve changed since then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ignored the comment. &#34;Why did you call me here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, right.&#34; Egbert pulled a document from his briefcase and handed it to her. &#34;Take a look. It&#39;s the contract you and Brandon signed back in Flesta when you came to find me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were traces of dried blood on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s eyes lingered on the pages. That day in Flesta came rushing back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon had dived into freezing water to pull her out.She had looked Egbert in the eye and reminded him -&#34;You gave me your word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, years later, he repeated those words, more composed but no less calculating. &#34;I gave you my word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the office lights, the blood-stained contract looked even more striking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Millie could take it, a hand reached out and grabbed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like that autumn day years ago, when he held her close and signed that contract-his own hand soiled with her blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he stood holding this very contract again,his eyes narrowed as he stared at Egbert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert met Brandon&#39;s gaze and flashed him a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve honored this contract all these years because of Millie,&#34; he said. &#34;But now that you&#39;re divorced,I think  it&#39;s void.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Millie, smiling. &#34;Just say the word, and I&#39;ll tear it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t answer. She walked over to Brandon and took the contract from his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flipped through it. Clause after clause, each one a sharp edge forged during desperate negotiations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, they had won for the Watson Group. But it hadn&#39;t been her victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had lost something invaluable instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie placed the contract on the table and looked across the room at Egbert, still smiling at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Egbert Perez,&#34; she said, clearly and evenly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34; His eyes brightened. The charming smile masked something darker beneath. He looked like a knight awaiting his princess&#39; orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie knew better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t a knight in shining armor. He was a devil in disguise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want to end the contract, find a better reason,&#34;she said. &#34;Don&#39;t use me as your excuse. And don&#39;t treat me like a pawn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of shock crossed Egbert&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; He sounded genuinely surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like back then. He had always thought he was the one in control, only to find the game shifting beneath him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, she had initiated that bet in Flesta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the two of them knew the details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone else thought Egbert had forced her into it.They believed he&#39;d manipulated her. But he hadn&#39;t.She had led him into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only the second time in his life he&#39;d been caught off guard-and both times, it was because of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, in the space of just fifteen minutes while Brandon was away, Millie had forced Egbert&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had stunned him three times in a row and eventually secured the contract.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, after years apart, she managed to catch him off -guard yet again-and still effortlessly so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you hated him,&#34; Egbert said softly, glancing at Brandon. &#34;I thought you&#39;d want revenge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie lowered her gaze, not answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you brought me here just to discuss this contract,&#34;she said, &#34;then I should make it clear. This is between the two of you. I was just a former employee at Watson Group. Now that I&#39;ve left, you should resolve it yourselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, and then added, &#34;You can end the collaboration for any reason you like. Just don&#39;t involve me. Now excuse me, for I have other things to take care of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t that she didn&#39;t resent Brandon. She just refused to be Egbert&#39;s pawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had come only to understand his intentions. Now that she had, she no longer wished to stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as she reached the door, a hand caught her wrist.She turned.Brandon&#39;s eyes met hers. They were dark,intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What really happened in Flesta during the fifteen minutes I was gone?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could speak, he added, &#34;That year,we lost a child. That child was mine too. I have a right to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp ache rose in Millie&#39;s chest. She pulled her hand away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze dropped briefly to the contract on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He used to say that Watson Group was their child too.That together, they could make it thrive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He promised that he-and the comnpany-would always stand behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now,he wouldn&#39;t even return the Bennett family&#39;s possessions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His promises had all become empty words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So should she tell him what really happened that year?</p>
