                <p>Three different servings of beef stew sat on the table before Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hardly more than a nibble from each, Brandon set his spoon down and gave up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the window, his gaze drifted to the city,where May&#39;s early heat shimmered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time slipped by as he remained fixated on the view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around him, the silence was deep, making it seem as though someone else ought to fill the chair across from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tucked in the drawer was his grandfather&#39;s note, and sorting through his own emotions felt impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finishing up with the lunch boxes, Vivian called out,&#34;Brandon,&#34; her voice gentle as she made her way over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an expectant look, he turned toward her, waiting for what she might say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting awkwardly, Vivian hesitated before speaking.&#34;Um, could you... lend me some money?&#34; she asked, clearly uneasy. &#34;The studio&#39;s tight on funds, but I&#39;ll pay you back soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s reply came quickly. &#34;How much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost whispering, Vivian kept her head low. &#34;Five million,&#34; she said, sounding even less sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out his phone, Brandon didn&#39;t hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ping from her phone signaled the transfer had gone through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s entire face lit up. &#34;You have no idea how much this means to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No hint of emotion crossed Brandon&#39;s features. His heartbeat remained even, untouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Vivian slipped out the door, he turned to address Eugene, his ever-present assistant. &#34;Clear everything from my schedule this afternoon and tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a simple tilt of his head, Eugene acknowledged the order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Brandon spoke again. &#34;Take tomorrow off my calendar as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene&#39;s eyes widened just slightly. The unspoken message was clear. Brandon would be closing the Chapter on his marriage first thing tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment of silence passed before Eugene offered a searching look, and then answered, &#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon wasted no more time. Keys in one hand and jacket in the other, he stepped out into the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene&#39;s voice carried down the hallway.&#34;Do you mind telling me your destination, Mr. Watson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A simple flick of Brandon&#39;s hand served as his only answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing more needed to be said. Eugene knew better than to follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Solitude became Brandon&#39;s companion as he cruised through city streets in his Maybach, directionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No plan guided him. Instead, he wandered,untethered,much like a cloud searching for somewhere to settle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, his drive ended. The car rolled to a stop before the gates of a mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was once the home where Millie&#39;s family built their lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just down the block, Brandon&#39;s own childhood memories lingered in the walls of another house He stepped out of his car, his pace unhurried as he approached the familiar property.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time had left its mark, and what was once grand now looked worn around the edges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, laughter filled the air. Brandon noticed the house belonged to strangers now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything changed after Millie&#39;s father passed away.The property had been sold off during the settlement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the sidewalk, Brandon watched the new family of three, and in their joy, he caught a glimpse of summers past-Millie&#39;s family together once more in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Parents spun each other around the room,their daughter giggling at the piano keys</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A red dress swirled with the music, and the little girl&#39;s joyful face seemed etched into his memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone shouted a warning, &#34;Slow down! You might fall!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch!&#34; A small accident interrupted the fun. The little girl-this new family&#39;s child-had run too fast, tripped,and landed in a sulky heap, nearly in tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon knelt beside her, producing a handkerchief to gently dry her cheeks, as though he could wipe away someone else&#39;s sorrow from long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offering comfort, he said, &#34;You&#39;re all right,&#34; and reached out to lift her gently from the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cheerful voice called from the doorway.&#34;Thank you,Mr. Watson!&#34; The child&#39;s mother hurried over,gratitude clear in her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People around here rarely forgot Brandon&#39;s name or story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offeing a small nod, he answered simply, &#34;Think nothing of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once more, his attention drifted down to the little girl beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears had dried, but she now watched him with a mixture of caution and wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, a gentle smile broke across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rose to his feet, deciding it was time to move on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, a wave of memory washed over him -he almost believed MAillie was standing there. Not the Millie hardened by loss, but the one before tragedy,before those cold stares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy breath left his chest as he walked back to his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found himself wondering if any destination could make sense now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With nowhere to go, Brandon pressed the accelerator,letting the city roll by</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts spun for what felt like hours, until finally the skyline thinned and he realized he&#39;d wandered into the city&#39;s forgotten edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to one side, a massive building rose against the fading light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bleak outline of Crobert&#39;s penitentiary stood against the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet certainty settled over Brandon as his car rolled to a stop. He finally understood who he needed to confront.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the entry process was done, he waited in the visitation room, his gaze landing on a man behind thick glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition brought a sour grin to the inmate&#39;s face.He snatched up the phone, lips curled in disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matching the gesture, Brandon lifted the receiver and held it to his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A taunt came through the line, saying, &#34;Look who it is -Mr. Watson himself. What&#39;s so important that you&#39;d drop by today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words didn&#39;t come. Brandon answered with a steady,silent stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side sat Hayden Grant. Once, he&#39;d played the role of Millie&#39;s stepfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicion edged Hayden&#39;s next question. &#34;Millie got you running her errands now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s answer was simple. &#34;I came on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With eyebrows raised, Hayden seemed surprised.&#34;So it wasn&#39;t her? What could you possibly have to say?clearly remembered you said men like me wveren&#39;t even worth your breath.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reply left Brandon&#39;s lips. He just watched Hayden,unflinching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time and prison had changed Hayden. His uniform sagged on a thinner frame, though nothing in his bearing suggested a truly broken man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shift in Brandon&#39;s demeanor unsettled Hayden. The silence pressed in, making him fidget in his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayden broke the silence, his voice carrying a hint of challenge. &#34;If you&#39;re not going to talk, then let me.I&#39;ve been stuck here for years-tell me, how are things with you and Millie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No answer came from Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly grin crossed Hayden&#39;s face. &#34;Seeing anyone new these days? Oh,wait-didn&#39;t you used to worship the ground she walked on, and didn&#39;t she practically live for you?&#34; He let out a dry laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions kept coming. &#34;So, did the two of you ever tie the knot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight motion, Brandon gave a nod, though he hesitated afterward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayden picked up on the subtle pause, pretending to be let down. He shook his head with a sigh</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Millie really went ahead and married into money.That&#39;s not surprising. You two always seemed close.Before Nicole and I got together, Millie already had plenty, but the Watson name carries weight. Did your family ever give her a hard time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon shook his head, still silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That only seemed to draw Hayden in further.&#34;She must have a way with people, convincing everyone like that. What was her secret?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Contact with the outside world had grown rare for Hayden,so his curiosity felt almost sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe Millie succeeded because she genuinely invested herself in those around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything started when Brandon&#39;s grandfather fell ill -that was the reason behind their marriage in the first place-but over time, both his grandparents grew to cherish Millie as one of their own. 1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayden raised his eyebrows. &#34;Suit yourself if you don&#39;t want to talk. But what brings you here, really? You didn&#39;t drop by just for conversation, did you?&#34; A flicker of realization crossed his face. &#34;Wait,is Millie in some kind of mess?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s eyes shifted downward, the weight of the question settling in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, he answered quietly, &#34;We&#39;re getting a divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The arrangement was all for show, a plan to remarry after half a year, yet the sadness still clung to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Real surprise flashed across Hayden&#39;s face this time.&#34;A divorce? Your family finally turned against her?That&#39;s just her luck. She loves you to the core and will literally do anything for you, and now you&#39;re tossing her aside. I can only imagine the tears-she&#39;s probably falling apart. Honestly, that&#39;s the best news I&#39;ve had all year!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayden&#39;s laughter rang through the receiver, sharp and grating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The visit drew to a close. Brandon set the phone back on the cradle and got to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A final glance at Hayden showed him still lost in cruel amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truth be told, it was never about his family rejecting Millie. The divorce was Brandon&#39;s own doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, it&#39;s time to go.&#34; A guard&#39;s voice broke the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away at last, Brandon exited the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the heavy doors closed behind him, he realized the reason he&#39;d come. The words he needed to hear were simple-&#34;She loves you to the core.&#34;</p>
