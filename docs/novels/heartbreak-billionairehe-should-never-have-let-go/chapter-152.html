                <p>Millie&#39;s image appeared on the screen, leaving the entire crowd speechless with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Backstage, Daphne stared at the screen in disbelief, mumbling under her breath that there had to be some mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Social media exploded in real time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People who&#39;d just been shouting insults were now frantically denying what they saw, picking apart every detail in search of something to disprove it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This has to be a setup! Millie and Serena clearly reached some kind of deal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some, this was the only explanation left to cling to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Seville sprang into action. &#34;Haha, we&#39;ve waited for this, pretending, enduring, just for the perfect reveal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he instructed his team to kick off an all-out pushback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no scam! Millie and Serena are one and the same! And let&#39;s not forget, Brandon donated millions at auction, and he&#39;s her husband! You see? He was using their money, so she did contribute!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! And all that talk about sleeping her way to the top was baseless. Serena&#39;s ranking came from pure talent, not some shady deal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Every accusation was part of a smear campaign. Serena&#39;s achievements were earned fair and square!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The tables have turned. Everything&#39;s changed now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, don&#39;t get ahead of yourselves, guys. Where&#39;s the concrete proof that Millie and Serena are actually the same person? Maybe they&#39;re just putting on a show together to distract us from the donation fraud thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online chaos erupted, yet right there on the Heavenly Melody stage, Millie stood her ground, refusing to step away even after her true identity was unveiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, it was at that exact moment that her performance reached its peak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up until now, every note had felt like watching a statue in progress, still rough and unfinished, but with the final mask falling from her face, a genuine transformation took place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No longer held back by judgment or scandal, she unleashed a breathtaking display that made everyone sit up and recognize her radiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bathed in the spotlight, Millie sang with fearless intensity, her clear, haunting voice and flawless skil matching Serena&#39;s unforgettable performances from the past few rounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every last remnant of plaster gone, a renewed version of herself emerged for all to witness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both her song and her presence spoke of reinvention, Millie and Serena, past and present, now fully united as one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dramatic run of soaring notes closed out her act, each pitch lifting her higher, rising above pain and doubt,just as she&#39;d risen through each challenge on the show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, there was no separation between Millie and Serena. Both identities belonged to her, seamlessly woven together on that stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the final chord faded, the crowd was struck silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All previous protests had melted away, and not even a whisper remained as everyone absorbed the magnitude of what they&#39;d just seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle &#34;Thank you,&#34; fell from Millie&#39;s lips as she bowed, her voice echoing in the hushed auditorium.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd exploded in applause, their cheers roaring so loudly it felt as if the whole building might shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Serena, you&#39;re incredible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely stunning,Serena!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget that! Millie is the real star!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter who you are! We&#39;re with you, Millie or Serena!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, wasn&#39;t there a scandal about donations?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give it a rest! She&#39;s Brandon&#39;s wife, so the money was theirs together. And let&#39;s not forget, if Serena hadn&#39;t been bidding that night, the tanzanite wouldn&#39;t have sold for nearly as much!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s show her our support! Serena deserves it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m in! Go, Serena!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wave of celebration wasn&#39;t limited to the venue. It also echoed across the Internet,too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A country that once booed her now rose to their feet, unified in admiration, as her performance became a living,breathing work of art.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable! Serena&#39;s a powerhouse! I&#39;ll always support her!&#34; Jayceon leapt from his seat, unable to contain his excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adriana, unusually generous, let her brother cheer as much as he wanted. She glanced at Brandon,quietly settled in his seat, and then at Myron lurking in the shadows, and let out a gentle laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adriana caught a sharp look from Myron and quickly dropped her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wasting a second, Myron shifted his focus to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon sat motionless, his expression unreadable, but a heaviness clung to him that Myron couldn&#39;t miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet laugh slipped from Myron before he looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Onstage, Millie was ready to leave, but the audience was nowhere near finished, their voices rising in a chorus begging her to stay a littlelonger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, the host returned to bring order. &#34;WVhat an incredible run! From &#39;Yesterday&#39; to &#39;Us,&#39; then &#39;Deep Sea,&#39; &#39;Journey&#39; and now &#39;Sculpture,&#39; Serena has amazed us at every turn! I know you want more of her live magic, but she needs a break tonight. Don&#39;t worry. There will be plenty of opportunities to see Serena again soon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the applause still echoed in the hall, Millie slipped backstage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barbara and Charles were quick to join her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down Barbara&#39;s face. &#34;Serena, I had no idea! And to think I defended Vivian at first...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her emotions tumbled between excitement and remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle smile, Millie reached out and brushed away Barbara&#39;s tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You goof, we made sure to keep everyone in the dark. There&#39;s no way you could&#39;ve known.&#34; Millie let out a gentle laugh. &#34;Besides, you figured out what Vivian was really like by yourself, didn&#39;t you? Stop blaming yourself. You&#39;re sobbing like a little kid,&#34; Millie teased, brushing away more of Barbara&#39;s tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles jumped in, offering a few reassuring words and even promising Barbara a bonus, which drew an embarrassed grin from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them wandered backstage, chatting and sharing a few laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They soon crossed paths with Vivian, her features twisted in barely contained fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s gaze, sharp and cold, locked onto Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the tension, Charles instinctively moved to shield Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian barely glanced at Charles before stepping closer,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, mocking smile crossed Vivian&#39;s lips as she looked at Millie.&#34;SO, Charles is your knight in shining armor now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie met Vivian&#39;s glare without flinching. &#34;I have no idea what you&#39;re trying to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian scoffed, her tone icy, &#34;You really think hiding behind Charles is going to save your ass? Please.Brandon&#39;s already thrown you aside, Millie. In the end, you&#39;re nothing but yesterday&#39;s news. Even as Serena,what does it matter? Do you honestly think Brandon will ever take you back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles tensed up and cut in sharply, &#34;That&#39;s enough, Vivian!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian ignored him completely, her attention fixed on Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So this is it, Millie? Hiding behind Charles now?&#34; Vivian sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie kept her smile light. &#34;You know, I honestly don&#39;t get it. Why do you despise me so much?&#34; she asked,her tone curious. &#34;You always wanted Brandon, right? Well, he&#39;s all yours now. So why the bitterness?Besides...&#34; Millie gave Vivian a knowing look. &#34;You might want to hold onto him tight-he has a habit of slipping away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian offered no reply, choosing instead to glare daggers at Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way she could let Millie find out or even suspect her illness was just a ruse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian still hadn&#39;t won Brandon over for good. She couldn&#39;t afford any mistakes now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Vivian&#39;s expression softened, turning frail and innocent as she glanced past Millie.&#34;Oh Brandon, you&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie turned to find Brandon walking over, his expression tangled with conflicting emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gave Vivian a nod, and then moved to take Millie aside for a private word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could touch her, Millie slipped deftly out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to talk, Millie...&#34; Brandon started, concern shadowing his face, but before he could finish, a new voice chimed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon glanced up to find Myron standing there, grinning at him.</p>
