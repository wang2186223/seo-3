                <p>Millie took a slow breath and decided not to overthink it. First, she needed to pick up Ari and get her to kindergarten before they ran late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles still had some loose ends to tie up,but he had already texted saying everything was handled-no need for her to stress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made her feel lighter, at least a little. She drove off to collect Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she arrived, something felt... off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari looked like she had something on her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the director of the children&#39;s home seemed hesitant too-like she wanted to say something but kept it in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie glanced from Ari to the director, giving them space to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But neither of them did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so, Millie said nothing either. She figured if they wanted to keep it private, she&#39;d respect that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shall we go?&#34; she asked gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari nodded. Millie smiled and slung the little backpack over her shoulder. They walked out together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before heading into the kindergarten gates, Ari tugged at Millie&#39;s sleeve. &#34;Will you be picking me up this afternoon?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually, Millie was the one who picked her up. If she couldn&#39;t, she always made sure it was someone Ari liked-Alexia or her brother, Sheridan or his brother,or sometimes Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari didn&#39;t usually ask. But since she did today, Millie could tell she wanted her to come today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bent down to meet the girl&#39;s eyes, gentlypressing a hand to her soft, chubby cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do my best,&#34; she said softly. &#34;And if I really can&#39;t,I&#39;ll come visit you tonight. I promise you&#39;ll still see me,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari&#39;s face lit up. Her eyes curved into little crescent moons, and she nodded eagerly. Then she turned to go. But after just a few steps, she spun around, ran back, and planted a kiss on Millie&#39;s cheek before dashing into the building with a skip in her step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie touched the spot where the kiss had landed, a quiet smile spreading across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things between her and Ari were shifting-growing deeper, warmer. She felt the warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After making sure Ari was safely inside,Millie headed to Evans Entertainment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By eight-thirty, she had parked outside the building She adjusted her disguise, pulled her mask higher, and made her way up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since she and Charles had been spotted together on camera and gossips went wild, she&#39;d learned to be more cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She entered through a side entrance and headed straight for the most private meeting room. Only after she was inside did she finally remove the mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice message from Charles buzzed through her phone. &#34;I&#39;ll be there around nine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded to herself and opened her notebook to start sketching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were still plans to go over for the Heavenly Melody finale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lost track of time in her sketches until the door finally opened. She looked up. Charles walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face was clouded. He closed the door and sat down across from her without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Millie asked, sensing something was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer immediately. His fingers tapped lightly against the table. As though he was carefully weighing his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie blinked. That alone was surprising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles usually spoke before he thought. She studied him. What could have happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not able to hold it back, she asked him directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can think too, you know!&#34; Charles snapped, clearly irritated. Last night,his grandfather had basically called him brainless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of it still boiled his blood. And now Millie did the same?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, fine,&#34; he muttered. &#34;I&#39;ll just say it.&#34; He let out a sigh. &#34;This morning, at the Evans family...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two hours earlier, over at the Watson Mansion,Charles had been doing everything he could to stay under the radar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time his brothers showed up, something went wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those two wolves never missed a chance to stir up trouble-and right now, they saw an opening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were now doing everything they could to pressure investors into forcing Serena-Evans Entertainment&#39;s own talent-out of the show. It was their best shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, the company could still make money off the show since they&#39;re a major investor, but Serena&#39;s image, her career, her future endorsements-all of it would be wiped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The show mattered. But it wasn&#39;t the core issue. The bigger win was Serena&#39;s future potential. Brand deals,ambassador roles-that was the long game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Serena got cancelled, all of Charles&#39; work would go up in flames. And that was their real endgame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So of course these two brothers were seizing this moment to corner Charles, throwing around sly remarks and whispering offers behind closed doors.All of it designed to make himn lose ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Napier, meanwhile, stayed on the sidelines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t care about the mess. His plan from the beginning had always been to let them fight it out. If it got ugly, well-that was their problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once everyone had arrived, Charles straightened his jacket and walked into the meeting room,ready to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was packed withinvestors and executives from all corners. Most of them had ties to his brothers.Even though Millie had won Napier over last time,Charles knew that wasn&#39;t enough. He still had work to do to win the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Evans,&#34; someone said sharply as soon as Charles stepped in. &#34;We called you several times last night. No reply. Today, we need an answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. This project doesn&#39;t belong to you alone. If it fails, we all lose. And that&#39;s not something you can just ignore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I messaged you already. There&#39;s a simple solution-remove Serena. Clean cut. Plenty of shows have done it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right. Replace the problematic figure and the rest goes forward. It&#39;s standard. And we&#39;ve dropped A-listers before. This isn&#39;t personal-simply damage control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Voices piled over each other. One suggestion after another. All of them pushingthe same agenda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles clenched his jaw, frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suggestions weren&#39;t new. They were standard,yes -but not all of them came from a place of reason.Some were just eager to watch him fall. He was fully aware.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for Millie&#39;s plan, he would&#39;ve been eaten alive in this room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles cleared his throat, preparing to speak. But before he could get a word out, a sharp tap echoed through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon leaned forward.&#34;Alright,everyone,give me a minute.&#34; He tucked his phone into his pocket and stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Elliott family was one of Crobert&#39;s big three names, and unlike the fractured Evans family, the Elliotts had unity on their side. No one interrupted and all just stare at Jayceon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here to speak on behalf of the Elliott family,&#34;he said. &#34;About Serena&#39;s situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every head turned, eyes shifting to Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew the Elliott Group had signed on as sponsors just two days ago. And now, this? They would definitely want to understand what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Jayceon turned against Charles right here, it would be the final blow. With the full table of investors watching, that kind of public disapproval would sink everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone watched Charles with eager anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39; brothers looked thrilled. They leaned back in their seats, smug and certain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, the timing of the Elliott sponsorship had made one thing clear-it wasn&#39;t a deal Charles had arranged. There&#39;d been no personal negotiation,so why would the Elliotts forsake their interests and side with Charles now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jayceon took a breath and began to speak.</p>
