                <p>Countless voices filled the air with complaints and regrets,while a few saw the chaos as an opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was moving quickly, making their own moves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stayed silent, calmly watching from the sidelines as she waited for the expected signal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time dragged on as various parties engaged in a battle of wits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bidding came to an end, and then the early trading session began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Watson Group&#39;s stock continued to plummet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their phones were getting blown up with frantic calls from panicked shareholders desperate for answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek and Norma watched the disaster play out with growing irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew from the start that Brandon divorcing Millie would bring him to this. Isn&#39;t this just karma?&#34; Derek snapped,thudding his cane on the floor in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norma let out a deep sigh.&#34;You still have to deal with the aftermath. No matter how mad you are at Brandon,you can&#39;t just sit back and let the Watson Group crumble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That little brat knows exactly what he&#39;s doing, and he&#39;s doing it to mess with me!&#34; Derek shouted, fuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the shadows, a figure moved into action,instructing their team with precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They began sweeping up shares, buying them in large volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the numbers were just about right, he picked up a phone and made a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Vivian glanced at the secret phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It rang three times and then went silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At 9:35 AM, while furious investors flooded the Internet with curses, blaming Brandon and dragging his entire family to filth,Vivian went live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of Brandon&#39;s current infamy, and since she was closely connected to him, her stream immediately exploded with viewers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene rushed into Brandon&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Watson, Miss Simpson just went live,&#34; Eugene reported, breathless and anxious. &#34;This wasn&#39;t part of the plan. WVhat is she trying to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s expression darkened as he reached for his phone and dialed her number. But Vivian didn&#39;t pick up.She stayed on air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one had seen this coming, not Millie, Charles,or Myron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone&#39;s attention turned to Vivian&#39;s live broadcast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On screen, she appeared with teary eyes, looking delicate and vulnerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked straight into the camera and said softly,&#34;I never thought the rumors about Brandon,Millie,and me wvould affect Watson Group&#39;s stock this much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was never what I wanted.&#34; She dabbed at her eyes and added, &#34;When I saw the stock price crash,I felt I had to clarify things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon turned to Eugene. &#34;Go find her and make her stop!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Eugene rushed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had worked through the night, reaching out to countless contacts, negotiating endlessly, trying to keep different sides in balance, even making a few reluctant compromises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every angle had been considered and every move had been mapped out. They had a thorough plan in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As one of Crobert&#39;s top three powerhouses, backed by a team of sharp minds, they couldn&#39;t-and definitely wouldn&#39;t-just sit still. They had to find a way forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian hadn&#39;t been part of their plan, and her sudden livestream could easily unravel everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Millie watched the livestream, blinking in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So this is it, Brandon? After I left the Watson Group,your brilliant move was sending Vivian to play the victim and win people&#39;s sympathy?&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t believe he would go that far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie was baffled, but decided to keep watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back on the stream, Vivian had calmed herself and continued talking. &#34;Everyone knows I don&#39;t have much time left... So, whatever there is between Brandon and I won&#39;t ruin his marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a faint, sorrowful smile. &#34;I won&#39;t be around much longer anyway. But since everyone seems so invested in the rumors, I&#39;ll explain everything today.There was never anything inappropriate between me and Brandon. Everything happened because I...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sniffed and continued, &#34;I told Brandon | didn&#39;t have much time left. I admitted that I liked him and asked if he could spend my last six months with me.Not as lovers, just... as someone by my side, doing the things I still wanted to experience with me. At first,he turned me down. He had made it clear, time and time again, that he and Millie shared a strong bond,and he had no intention of betraying his marriage. But when my health declined further, and maybe because I&#39;d once helped him, things turned out the way they did.He divorced Millie because he didn&#39;t want her thinking he was being unfaithful. The truth is, his feelings for me aren&#39;t that deep. Maybe after I&#39;m gone, he and Millie will find their way back to each other. I can&#39;t say for sure. This livestream, by the way, is something l decided to do on my own. He is completely unaware of it. I hadn&#39;t planned to speak out like this, especially since I&#39;ve only got five months left. But watching the Watson Group&#39;s stock plummet over this... I couldn&#39;t bear the guilt.&#34; 1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian let out a dry cough on camera. As she brought a tissue to her lips, the viewers caught a glimpse of the bloodstain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly tucked the tissue out of sight, as if she  didn&#39;t want the audience to see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint, bitter smile, she said, &#34;The business partners aren&#39;t pulling out. There&#39;s no outrageous divorce settlement. Honestly, Brandon and I never even shared a bed. If the stock keeps fluctuating because of rumors like this, then it&#39;s really-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a knock came at the door, and Vivian turned her head,startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,the stream abruptly cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the doorway, Eugene stood out of breath, staring at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Simpson, you can&#39;t make moves like this without running it by us first!&#34; he snapped,struggling to hold back his exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian feigned an apologetic look and said, &#34;I&#39;m sorry.I just thought I could help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then gestured toward a graph on the screen nearby. &#34;See? It&#39;s working. The stock price is starting to bounce back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene nearly rolled his eyes. The recovery had nothing to do with her. It was clearly the result of their plan finally kicking in. But he didn&#39;t dare say anything too harsh. All he could do was take Vivian back with him to the Watson Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, the company&#39;s stock price had started to climb again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That much was expected since Brandon had a plan and just like any other publicly traded firm, they had professionals in place to handle this kind of situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Vivian&#39;s little stunt had set off waves of gossip across the industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To those who didn&#39;t know the fulI story, she might have seemed pitiful. But to others, she came off as nothing more than a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles burst out laughing and turned to Millie. &#34;Did you hear? Brandon&#39;s become the laughingstock of the entire industry! It&#39;s ridiculous! Since when did he start pulling such cheap tricks? Hlonestly, it&#39;s killing me. My stomach hurts from laughing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie couldn&#39;t believe it either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The overblown divorce rumors had already been cleared up the day before. There was never such a case to begin with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The real reason behind the wave of panic that tanked the stock was a rumor that one of the Watson Group&#39;s biggest partners was about to pull out, with others supposedly following suit and pulling out as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Egbert had only gone to give Brandon a scare yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The contract had already been signed, and pulling out wasn&#39;t something that could be done on a whim. At most,they might choose not to renew it when the time came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was exactly why Millie had told Egbert not to drag her name into the matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Watson Group had a strong foundation in technology, and they got the contract back then only because they overcame technological barriers first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So even if Brandon had truly behaved like a jerk to his wife, his personal life had little to do with his professional one. While it could shake investor confidence a little, it wasn&#39;t enough to cause significant damage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as the company stayed on top of things,the stock price would bounce back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, the situation had taken a strange turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s stunt was embarrassing, so much so that it was hard to even talk about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this what Brandon had become without Millie by his side?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought echoed throughout the industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what most people didn&#39;t yet realize was that Vivian&#39;s actions had opened the door to a whole new wave of trouble.</p>
