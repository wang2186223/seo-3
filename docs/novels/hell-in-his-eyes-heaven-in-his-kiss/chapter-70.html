                <p>Gabriela felt as though she could barely catch her breath,nearly overwhelmed by how close she was to Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he still rock-hard against her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he awake?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he realized she was nestled so snugly against him,would he be upset?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley was, in fact, fully awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slightest shift from Gabriela snapped him to attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A twinge of irritation flickered within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was early morning, and the woman he cherished was wrapped in his arms-how could he possibly remain unaffected?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body burned with intensity, yet he held himself still, wary of alarming Gabriela. He planned to feign sleep, hoping she would slipaway first, but she stayed put.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with his physical reaction impossible to hide,she seemed too nervous to move, as if she were suffocating under the weight of the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley, both frustrated and self-conscious, spoke with measured calm. &#34;Have you forgotten how to breathe? Open your eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was cool, but it carried the rough edge of someone freshly roused from sleep, making the moment feel even more intimate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, still pretending to be asleep, refused to open her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you care about your paycheck?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sentence got her attention. Her eyes flew open instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>earn everywhere. She tilted her head up, meeting Wesley&#39;s intense,deep-set gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks flushed crimnson as she played dumb,acting as if she had just stirred awake. &#34;Morning, Mr.Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,&#34; he replied, a faint smirk tugging at his lips. &#34;Didn&#39;t you say sleeping on opposite sides of the bed wouId work out fine? Care to explain this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Petite as she was, Gabriela had curled up completely within Wesley&#39;s embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With any other man, this might have spelled trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her attempt to brush it off didn&#39;t fool him, and at his words, her face grew even redder. With a playful tone, she shot back, &#34;Mr. Moss, if I said I might have a sleepwalking problem, would you buy it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley didn&#39;t respond to her quip. Instead, he said,&#34;Get up, freshen up, and figure out how you&#39;re going to justify this to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela scrambled to her feet and bolted to the bathroom, her heart racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley seemed so stern-did accidentally ending up in his armns really warrant an explanation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her dart away, Wesley let out a soft chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The master bedroom&#39;s bed was enormous, spanning four meters, plenty of space for two to sleep far apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night, after lying down, he had tried to force himself to sleep immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the subtle scent beside him enveloped him,setting his pulse racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tossed and turned, barely sleeping a wink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making her a little anxious and flustered felt fair-he shouldn&#39;t be the only one uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley rose, planning to leave the room and find another bathroom to shower. But the door wouldn&#39;t open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recalling Loretta and Miriam&#39;s meddling from the night before, he pieced together their scheme and chuckled quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today,he realized just how charming Gabriela was.In just two days at the estate, she had completely won over his housekeeper and grandmother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Gabriela emerged, dressed and composed,Wesley informed her, &#34;The door is locked from the outside. I&#39;ve called my grandmother-she will come and unlock it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for her reply, he stepped into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, Loretta and Miriam arrived to open the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta had a restless night, and when Wesley&#39;s call came, she rushed over to see what had unfolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Gabriela already dressed, she felt a pang of disappointment. &#34;Gabriela, did anything happen between you and Wesley last night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s expression faltered, a touch awkward.&#34;Everything was fine. The bed is huge, and we each kept to our own side without disturbing each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t dare admit she had ended up curled in Wesley&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;You two shared a bed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s ears turned scarlet as she insisted, &#34;It&#39;s an enormous bed! We weren&#39;t even within arm&#39;s reach of each other!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta and Miriam exchanged a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam kept scanning Gabriela&#39;s neck for any telltale marks,but found none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell! They had slept in the same bed, and nothing had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible that Wesley really had no interest in women?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela sensed Loretta&#39;s and Miriam&#39;s disappointment but didn&#39;t know how to comfort them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Larson, Miriam, shall we head downstairs?&#34; she suggested, hoping to escape the awkwardness before Wesley finished his shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta and Miriam, visibly deflated, followed her out of the master bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Wesley emerged from the bathroom and entered the walk-in closet, he chose a shirt, vest, tie,and watch, dressing with care before slipping into his suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He usually worked from home in casual clothes,but today, for some reason, he felt the need to dress sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps it was to reassert some authority in Gabriela&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Wesley descended the stairs, Gabriela&#39;s gaze immediately found him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now fully dressed, he exuded his usual distant, unapproachable air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said briskly, &#34;Mr. Moss, I apologize for the inconvenience these past two days. I would like to head home now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hoped her polite request would spare her from explaining herearlier actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s lips quirked slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the morning&#39;s unexpected events leaving him a bit irritated, deep down, he wanted her to stay.He enjoyed her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which home?&#34; he asked with a scoff. &#34;The one where they locked you out at night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela hesitated, then met his gaze firmly. &#34;Yes,that&#39;s my home-the house my mother left me.I&#39;ll reclaim it one day, no matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the future, no one would dare bar her from her own home again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The usually reserved Gabriela had a spark of determination in her eyes as she spoke of taking back her house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley was certain she could do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having grown up in tough circumstances, she had still emerged vibrant and optimistic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing could stand in her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is your foot better?&#34; he asked, his tone detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing his cool voice, Gabriela replied quickly, &#34;It&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>fine now. I can even wear heels.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if it still ached; she wouldn&#39;t admit it-Wesley would only lecture her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll have my driver drive you home,&#34; Wesley said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela almost declined, but knowing his temperament, she nodded and thanked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their conversation flowed smoothly, but it left Loretta and Miriam uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on!&#34; Loretta interjected urgently. &#34;Wesley,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela is a guest-you can&#39;t just send her off the moment she&#39;s up. At least let her have breakfast first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam chimed in, &#34;I&#39;ll have the kitchen prepare it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried off to the kitchen in a flash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela had no choice but to stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She resolved to leave right after breakfast,determined not to linger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But things did not unfold as she expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a quick breakfast, Loretta mentioned the onions she had brought and asked Gabriela to help dry them in the sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley, catching onto Miriam&#39;s matchmaking,said with a sigh, &#34;Grandma, Gabriela is on vacation. You shouldn&#39;t be giving her tasks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta, unimpressed, was about to scold him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Moss, it&#39;s fine,&#34; Gabriela cut in quickly,worried Loretta might get upset. &#34;It&#39;s just a small favor, no  trouble at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After drying the onions, Loretta produced a stack of gift boxes, handing them to Gabriela to help assemble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each one would be given as a New Year present to the estate&#39;s staff as a small token of appreciation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was stunned- she had never seen a family give gifts to their servants before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How many staff did the manor have? How much would it cost to prepare all those gifts?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting moment, Gabriela reasoned that if she shamelessly stayed for New Year&#39;s, perhaps she would get a gift too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surely Wesley wouldn&#39;t mind adding one more,right?</p>
