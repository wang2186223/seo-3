                <p>Restless thoughts of Wesley kept Gabriela from drifting off, her mind circling back to him no matter how she tried to distract herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each time she shifted in bed, her sore ankle brushed against the sheets, sending a quick, sharp jolt through her and drawing a wince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole day had felt cursed from start to finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After rolling over a few more times, she snatched up her phone and fired off a message to &#34;NotASaunders,&#34; venting her irritation. &#34;What exactly was that stunt at the wedding today? Yo showed up with a girlfriend and didn&#39;t even warn me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waited for what felt like forever, but her screen stayed blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration bubbling over, she typed out another message. &#34;If you weren&#39;t going to help me, you should&#39;ve said so. I could have rented a boyfriend myself. You told me to buy the suit-so why set me up to look like a fool?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet again, silence was all that came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her temper flared so hot she nearly sent another message demanding the hundred thousand dollars back immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a spoiled heir like Brenden, that kind of money was no more than a night&#39;s pocket change. For her,every single bill had been fought for and earned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, after what felt like an eternity, a reply popped up.&#34;Idiot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stared at the screen, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was that supposed to mean? After humiliating her in public, wasting her money, and making her the butt of the joke, Brenden had the audacity to throw that at her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury coursed through her as she smacked the mattress with her palm-then froze mid-swing. This wasn&#39;t even her bed. If she broke it, she wouldn&#39;t be able to afford the damages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed herself upright, drawing in a few steadying breaths until the tightness in her chest began to ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts drifted back to the whole ridiculous business of having Brenden pretend to be her boyfriend, and the more she replayed it, the clearer it became-he had never been committed. Even after returning from Afluena, he&#39;d hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was supposed to notice the warning signs at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet he&#39;d told her to buy a suit, even gone so far as to present her with a gown, and that kindness had sparked her hope again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, on the wedding day, he&#39;d showed up late-while girlfriend number forty-one had already been waiting at the venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Wesley hadn&#39;t stepped in, Josh would probably stil be sobbing into his champagne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the very beginning, Brenden had been playing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization sent heat surging through Gabriela again, and she silently vowed to return the humiliation at the first opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For tonight, though, revenge could wait. Sleep came first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela slid beneath the covers without hesitation,letting the mattress swallow her up in warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pillow carried a faint trace of shower gel,layered with a subtle masculine scent that wrapped around her like an invisible embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat crept into her cheeks as she curled deeper into the blanket, the phantom sensation of Wesley&#39;s arms lingering in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True to her nature, she didn&#39;t linger on unpleasant thoughts. Once she&#39;d shaken off the last of her earlier frustration, her breathing slowed and sleep claimed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her dreams spiraled into a collage of vivid,disordered moments-every one of them centered on Wesley, his tall frame and sculpted muscles impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By morning, the knot of tension had unraveled. She woke feeling unexpectedly light, her ankle tender but far less painful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed the ointment Wesley had rubbed in worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a quick wash, she slipped back into yesterday&#39;s clothes, tugged on the cheerful slippers Miriam had set out for her, and padded toward the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley sat on the sofa, the morning paper spread neatly in his hands. At the faint sound of footsteps on the stairs, he lifted his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of his usual tailored suit, he wore a pale knit sweater, the casual attire softening the crisp,imposing edge he normally carried and lending a quiet warmth to his striking features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she faced him, Gabriela&#39;s pulse quickened and unbidden images from last night&#39;s dreams rushed back, making it impossible for her to meet his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her chin tucked as his smooth, clear voice reached her. &#34;Morning, Gabriela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The early hour left a subtle huskiness in his tone, and the sound rippled through her in a way she couldn&#39;t quite name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened slightly, answering with careful respect, &#34;Good morning, Mr. Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s gaze flicked to her ankle, noting she was able to stand evenly now, a clear sign the injury had eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faintest crease in his brow smoothed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Gabriela!&#34; Miriam called warmly as she stepped out of the kitchen. &#34;Come, have breakfast.&#34; One after another, the breakfast plates appeared,filling the table with inviting aromas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley had already taken his seat, so Gabriela,unwilling to keep him waiting, quickly slid into the chair beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for the serving ladle, pouring oatmeal into a bowl for Wesley, then filled one for herself and Miriam with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her movements were fluid and confident-little gestures she&#39;d performed countless times, sO natural they barely needed thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam&#39;s opinion of her rose another notch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling beside Gabriela, Miriam asked with genuine concern, &#34;Is your ankle feeling any better? You should let Wesley put some more ointment on it later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela had just lifted a spoonful of oatmeal to her lips when Miriam&#39;s comment made her pause. She set the spoon down, shaking her head with a small smile. &#34;That&#39;s not necessary. It barely hurts now.I can take care of it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She prided herself on not being fragile, and the thought of asking Wesley to tend to her injury again felt excessive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam, however, wouldn&#39;t budge. &#34;Don&#39;t brush it off.If I say you need it, you need it.&#34; Her tone left little room for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, no matter how firm Miriam sounded, she wasn&#39;t about to let Wesley near her ankle again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley, noticing she could walk without difficulty,didn&#39;t press her either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after breakfast, Billy appeared with the six-member tink tank in tow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Athea project might have been wrapped up,but other ventures still needed their final touches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy strode in with brisk confidence, energy radiating from him, the neatly dressed team at his back exuding an air of polished authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s gaze lingered on Billy longer than she intended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder Wesley held him in such high esteem-his presence carried an effortless authority even in the role of an assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that quiet satisfaction in his eyes because his proposal had gone off successfully last night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that were the case, she was genuinely glad for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offering a warm smile, she called out, &#34;Good morning, Mr. Clarke. I didn&#39;t expect to see you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy froze for a beat, caught off guard by the sight of Gabriela-striking, poised, and far too dazzling for the early hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t Wesley&#39;s love confession been a bust? Then why was she here now, at this time of morning clearly not just arriving? Could it be Wesley had found another way to win her over?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Wesley wasn&#39;t a man whose affairs one dared to speculate about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy smoothed his expression at once and spoke in a courteous tone. &#34;Good morning, Miss Haynes. I&#39;m here to give Mr. Moss an update on the project.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see.&#34; Gabriela&#39;s lips curved in a teasing wink paired with a warm smile before she moved down the line,greeting each team member in turn. &#34;I&#39;ll let you all get to your meeting,&#34; she added lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pivoted away at an unhurried pace, the faint hitch in her step betraying a limp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy&#39;s brow furrowed, and beside him, Aaron&#39;s curiosity got the better of him. &#34;Why&#39;s Miss Haynes walking like that? Did she hurt herself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization dawned on Billy, hitting him so suddenly it left him momentarily frozen in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley had never been the romantic sort, the kind of man who could go decades without so much as a flicker of affection for anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet when that rare spark finally took hold, it roared to life with an intensity no one could have foreseen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It appeared Wesley had shared a passionate night with Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Gabriela sank into the sofa beside Miriam, the soft yarn pooled in her lap as she learned the delicate art of knitting socks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the time she was small, life had been a constant balancing act-each day spent tiptoeing over thin ice, working herself ragged just to keep food on the table and stay in school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every waking hour had been shadowed by the need to guard herself, to brace for the next cruel,calculated scheme Phyllis might unleash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A simple, comforting pastime like this was something she had never even dared to imagine for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam guided her with patient precision, her voice low and steady, while Gabriela leaned in over her work, intent on perfecting every stitch. She was so focused that she missed the odd, lingering gleam in Billy&#39;s eyes.</p>
