                <p>Chapter91 Locked In The Same Room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s mind churned with restless thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She even controlled her breathing, wary that Wesley might somehow realize she had already uncovered the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s voice suddenly cut through the air-cold,clipped,and distant. &#34;Grandma, don&#39;t lock the door. I&#39;m not going in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela froze,her chaotic thoughts gradually settling into a tense stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,for reasons she couldn&#39;t quite name, a faint sting of discomfort lingered in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s treatment of her was needlessly harsh, his disdain barely concealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it wasn&#39;t as if Loretta&#39;s actions were malicious;everything she did was for his sake. Why, then, did he respond with such biting indifference?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he carried himself with more maturity, like someone truly ready to build a life with a partner, perhaps Loretta wouldn&#39;t feel compelled to worry and fuss over him every single day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swallowing her frustration, Gabriela forced herself to gather the shattered porcelain, each piece cold and jagged against her fingers, eager to retreat to her room once she was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Miriam stopped her with a gentle touch, saying &#34;Gabriela, Mrs. Larson made some nourishing soup tonight.Come downstairs and have a bowl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still distracted, Gabriela followed Miriam down the staircase,her mind moving through a fog</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they had left, Loretta placed her hands firmly on her hips and launched into a scolding aimed at Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reprimand went on for a solid three minutes before Wesley&#39;s expression soured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of discomfort swept through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t decide if it was the lingering effect of the soup or the wine he had drunk earlier, but heat pulsed through his body, leaving him restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already changed clothes, intending to slip out to see a private doctor quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, he had hoped to avoid attracting attention-planning to leave and return without anyone noticing.But Loretta had insisted on preparing a midnight snack  and personally delivering it to his room. The unnecessary commotion killed his mood for the doctor&#39;s visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he wanted now was simply the quiet relief of a bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resigned, he admitted fault, offering enough contrition for Loretta to ease her lecture-though she remained firm about one condition: he could not return to the master bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There may still be some shards in your room, so you can&#39;t sleep there tonight. Go stay with your cousin for the night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Impossible!&#34; Wesley&#39;s voice carried sharp finality. His mild obsession with cleanliness made the idea unbearable-especially since Brenden snored like a saw through wood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta countered, &#34;Then sleep in the next room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for his reply, she guided him into another room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley settled onto the soft bed,inhaling the subtle aroma of scented candles. Something about it felt oddly out of place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,since Loretta hadn&#39;t insisted on him sharing a room with Gabriela, he reluctantly decided to make do with  this room for just one night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps Loretta had truly broken those plates by accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he really had been overthinking the whole matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Wesley&#39;s thoughts lacked their usual sharpness.Weariness overtook him, and he eventually collapsed onto the bed, closing his eyes until sleep claimed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Gabriela returned to her room after finishing the soup in the dining room with Miriam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind felt clouded, as if wrapped in fog, and she longed for quiet to sort through the link between Wesley and &#34;NotASaunders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she made her way upstairs, Loretta blocked her from returning to her own bedroom, offering an odd explanation. &#34;Gabriela, tonight you need to stay away from Wesley&#39;s bedroom, now that he is in a sour mood.Please sleep in another room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without questioning Loretta&#39;s strange reasoning,Gabriela headed straight to the room she&#39;d been assigned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, she left the light off, sitting alone in the darkness while scrolling through her old chats with &#34;NotASaunders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their conversations weren&#39;t many.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the start, &#34;NotASaunders&#34; had known about her one-night stand with Brenden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was Brenden who had told Wesley about it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps Wesley had added her on WhatsApp purely for his own amusement, tossing out outrageous and absurd requests just to tease her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Gabriela thought about the situation, the more her anger flared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had only stumbled into the wrong room once,and that had been while drunk. She had never wanted to have sex with Brenden. Did Wesley really need to tease her like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s frustration boiled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething, she flopped onto the bed, flailing her arms and legs in exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,a strange sensation swept over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air carried a faint trace of alcohol,mingled with the undeniable presence of another person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone was in the room. Her pulse spiked. She snapped on the bedside lamp and turned her head-only to find Wesley lying on the other side of the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach dropped. Instinct screamed at her to run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if Wesley believed she had deliberately entered his room?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bolted toward the door-only to freeze when she heard him groan softly, the sound heavy with discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta had mentioned that Wesley hadn&#39;t been feeling well in recent days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she was still furious at him for playing the role of &#34;NotASaunders,&#34; he had been kind to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had even secured her future with a generous advance-ten years&#39; worth of salary-giving her the confidence to stand her ground against Phyllis and Marie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, Wesley was far more than just an employer who signed her paycheck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Wesley shifted again, a low, pained groan escaping his lips. Gabriela bit her lip, her concern slowly overtaking her simmering anger. She stepped closer and asked softly &#34;Mr.Moss, are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She climbed onto the bed and gave him a careful push</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Moss, are you feeling unwell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even through the thin fabric of his white shirt,she felt an intense heat radiating from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alarm prickled through her, and she quickly reached out to touch his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fever?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet his condition didn&#39;t match the usual signs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind flashed to the picture of the wine glass, the faint aroma of alcohoI still lingering in the air, and she drew her conclusion-Wesley was drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The possibility left her at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t even been here for a week, and already she had discovered just how peculiar this family could be. Loretta clung to strangely old-fashioned beliefs,Brenden might have a split personality,and Wesley-well, he was not interested in women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, despite knowing he had a heart condition,he still chose to get drunk at night</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wealthy truly seemed to have a reckless love for danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a resigned sigh, Gabriela decided to fetch a towel to cool him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before doing that, she tried the door, but-just as she expected-it was locked from the outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another sigh escaped her. She would have to tell Loretta, plainly and directly, that Wesley&#39;s disinterest in women wasn&#39;t something she could fix.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if they were locked in together for ten days,it wouldn&#39;t make a difference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling beside Wesley, she pulled out her phone and began recording. &#34;Mr. Moss, you&#39;re drunk right now,and the door&#39;s locked, so I can&#39;t leave. I&#39;m only here to take care of you, not because I snuck in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she had her video evidence, Gabriela set to work, gently wiping Wesley&#39;s face. His brow stayed tightly furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was in clear discomfort, his body burning with heat</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, the soft press of the warm towel against his forehead seemed to ease him, like a calming balm reaching his very core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, his hand shot up, gripping the slender wrist that held the towel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes opened-dark, deep, and more intense than the night beyond the window-glimmering with a dangerous edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela froze. &#34;Mr. Moss, you&#39;re awake. I didn&#39;t sneak in...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh from her shower, the faint fragrance of her skin and hair drifted into Wesley&#39;s senses, breaking his Last shred of restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one swift motion, he rolled over, pinning her beneath him, his grip on her hand unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers, still caught in his grasp, brushed against the cold metal of his belt buckle as he moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was utterly stunned.</p>
