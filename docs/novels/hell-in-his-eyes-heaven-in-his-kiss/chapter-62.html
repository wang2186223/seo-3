                <p>Sensing the sudden heaviness in the car, Gabriela bit back whatever she&#39;d been about to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vehicle slipped free of the city&#39;s noisy streets,gliding down a broad stretch of asphalt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Towering plane trees arched overhead, their rain-slick leaves catching the faint glimmer of streetlights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the drizzle gone, the night air felt still, almost watchful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Little by little, the noise faded, leaving the streetlights to bathe everything in a soft, golden haze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s brows drew together-was her boss seriously giving her a late-night scenic drive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with the simmering force radiating from him in the seat beside her, she decided it was wiser to keep that question to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt like a mere afterthought in his world,powerless to change whatever plans he had for her.Wherever he meant to take her, the safest choice was to follow without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the road curved, the skyline opened up, revealing a towering building ahead, its facade crowned with gleaming letters that read &#34;Moss Manor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did it dawn on Gabriela-this was Wesley&#39;s private estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two massive iron gates guarded the entrance, their dark metal both forbidding and sleek with a modern design. At the first glimpse of Wesley&#39;s car,the gates stirred to life, parting in a slow, deliberate sweep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without breaking stride, Wesley steered through the grand opening, the drive winding for several minutes before the car finally rolled to a stop before the mansion&#39;s main entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela guessed the sprawling estate had to stretch across several thousand acres.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her awe hadn&#39;t even peaked when her gaze caught on two immaculate lines of servants outside,each dressed in neat blue-and-white uniforms, standing at attention to welcome Wesley home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, she leaned toward him and murmured, &#34;Mr.Moss, your place could pass for a five-star hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the poised staff to the endless manicured grounds, the gleaming facilities, and the fountains spilling into elegant gardens... even the most extravagant hotel might struggle to match this level of opulence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking her compliment might coax some warmth from him, she glanced over hopefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deeper shadow crossed his features. &#34;So, you think my house isn&#39;t homely enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela found herself tongue-tied,her mind blank in the face of his unreadable mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley, as always, seemed to interpret reality through some private lens no one else shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her silence stretched, he stepped out of the car with a glacial air. A uniformed servant approached at once, bowing slightly as he reached for the keys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This servant, used to nothing more dramatic than parking Wesley&#39;s car, froze when Wesley strode around to the passenger side and, without a word,lifted a striking young woman into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, the servant simply stared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cradled against Wesley&#39;s chest, Gabriela stiffened,her voice edged with embarrassment. &#34;Mr. Moss,please-put me down. I can walk just fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reply came low and clipped. &#34;If you&#39;d prefer not to limp by the end of the night, stay sti11.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, unwilling to risk upsetting Wesley, instantly went slack against him, nestling into his arms without the slightest resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after Wesley&#39;s tall frame vanished through the grand entrance, the servant remained rooted to the spot, clutching the car keys, his mind spinning in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In all his years of service here, he had never once seen Wesley bring a woman home-let alone carry one inside. Wesley had never been linked to any romance. Whispers among the staff even claimed he might not be interested inwomen at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet tonight&#39;s scene had shattered that notion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever had been spreading those ridiculous rumors was in for a rude awakening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From somewhere deeper inside the manor, a voice called, &#34;Has Mr. Moss returned?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam Torres, the long-time housekeeper of the manor, rushed out at thesound of the car, hastily draping a coat over her shoulders. When her eyes landed on Wesley carrying a young woman in his arms, she froze mid-step, stunned into silence for several seconds. After lowering Gabriela onto the sofa, Wesley spoke up, his tone carrying a sharp edge. &#34;Don&#39;t get up.Stay right where you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment she&#39;d been set down, Gabriela hadn&#39;t dared shift an inch, yet she still got scolded by Wesley. Now she was convinced her boss was in a foul mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam froze mid-step, the medical kit clutched in her hands, as her gaze took in Gabriela&#39;s white dress layered beneath a pale gray overcoat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition flashed in her eyes-this was no ordinary outfit. She remembered when Wesley had personally commissioned the dress over two weeks ago, along with a custom dark gray suit tailored by his private designer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a matching set, unmistakably a couple&#39;s ensemble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, she&#39;d quietly wondered if the elusive Wesley had finally taken an interest in someone. Now, seeing Gabriela in the dress, she no longer needed to speculate. The answer was written plainly before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Wesley was at last entertaining romance,Miriam intended to make the most of it-nudging every opportunity to draw the two of them closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She passed the first aid kit into Wesley&#39;s hands. &#34;Mr.Moss, I&#39;ve got soup simmering in the kitchen. Make sure you treat her properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He accepted it without a word, his sharpo features set in a cold, focused expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, he crouched in front of Gabriela, his movements deliberate as he eased her shoe off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her foot was small and delicate, but the purplish swelling at her ankle made the injury look far worse than she&#39;d expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unwilling to inconvenience him, she murmured, &#34;Mr.Moss,I can manage it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze flicked to hers, voice clipped. &#34;Don&#39;t move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flipping the kit open, Wesley took out the disinfectant, spraying it over the bruise before smoothing on a layer of pain-relief ointment. His fingers were firm yet unexpectedly gentle as he worked the medication in, his touch careful despite the chill in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was obviously out of his depth with such delicate work, his movements hesitant and a touch clumsy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, there was a quiet determination in the way he worked the ointment into her skin, each motion deliberate as he eased the sprain with painstaking care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela found her eyes drawn to Wesley again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stray lock of hair fell forward, shadowing his eyes and making his expression unreadable, lending him an unexpected air of mystery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For all his reputation, her boss was capable of surprising gentleness. The tension in the room gradually melted into something softer, warmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley lifted his head without warning,his voice low but intent. &#34;Is it starting to feel any better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, the clean lines of his face caught the light-refined features framed by a strong jaw, his calm composure offset by a quiet magnetism that was impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in a crouch, he carried himself with an effortless nobility, the kind that made the air around him feel sharper and cooler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s gaze darted away, heat blooming in her cheeks as her heart thudded-this was the first time she&#39;d ever seen the CEO&#39;s face so close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Handsome didn&#39;t even begin to cover it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping back to reality, she realized he&#39;d only asked if she felt better, yet she&#39;d frozen like an idiot and looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To cover her awkwardness, her eyes drifted toward the carved wooden chess set on the side table, and she forced a too-bright smile. &#34;Mr. Moss, is this cedar? It&#39;s gorgeous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s answer was nothing more than a clipped word.&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was curt, the words wrapped in a cool detachment that made it clear he wasn&#39;t interested in small talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, still unsure of the wood&#39;s type, felt heat creep up her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s walnut, not cedar,&#34; Miriam corrected warmly,her smile bright as she stepped closer. &#34;Are all the injuries taken care of? I just made soup-come warm up with a bowl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley rose at once, his movement brisk, a faint stiffness in his posture. &#34;I&#39;m not hungry,&#34; he said, his voice low but final.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at his watch. &#34;I&#39;ve got a quick meeting to handle. Make sure she&#39;s settled in somewhere comfortable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam promised him she&#39;d handle everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without lingering, Wesley strode toward the study,his steps measured and unhurried, while Gabriela swallowed the urge to protest staying here-she could already imagine him scolding her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam turned back with an easy smile. &#34;Come on,Gabriela. Have some soup while it&#39;s hot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela accepted the bowl with both hands, her gratitude genuine. &#34;Thanks, Miriam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she finished the hearty soup, Miriam guided her upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Balancing on one foot, Gabriela hopped after her like an awkward, fluffy rabbit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam&#39;s fondness for Gabriela only deepened with each passing glance. After a brief moment of thought, she led Gabriela into one of the manor&#39;s more generous guest rooms. The instant Gabriela stepped inside, her breath caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s wealth was unmistakable-even a guest room sprawled out like a luxury suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cool, muted tones of the walls and drapes exuded a quiet elegance, while the tasteful, modern furnishings radiated understated sophistication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam soon returned with an armful of necessities-freshly laundered towels, a neatly boxed toothbrush,and a set of sleepwear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet &#34;sleepwear&#34; was hardly the right word; what Miriam laid on the bed was a silky light-blue slip dress, the delicate spaghetti straps and fluid fabric whispering of indulgence rather than rest.</p>
