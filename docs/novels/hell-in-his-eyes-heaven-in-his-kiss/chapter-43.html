                <p>Chapter43 This Was Absolutely His Doing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis had always carried herself from a lofty perch, a figure Gabriela would once have obeyed without question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, Gabriela met each of her words with sharp, unflinching comebacks-every barb returned with tenfold bite-leaving Phyllis&#39;s temper close to boiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was an audacity in Gabriela now, a wild defiance that went beyond mere talk. She had not only dared to seize Phyllis by the hair but had stared her down with mocking eyes, her tone dripping with challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had Gabriela gotten the guts to stand her ground? Where had she found the nerve to snap back like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of bitter questions churned through Phyllis&#39;s mind, though she forced her features into a mask of refinement for Josh&#39;s sake, tilting her head as if wounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had no idea Rhys was that sort of man,&#34; she murmured, her voice trembling with practiced hurt.&#34;You&#39;ve always drawn trouble to yourself-so why point the finger at me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The insinuation was clear: Gabriela&#39;s life seemed destined to invite chaos, and Phyllis was merely caught in its wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an icy tone, Gabriela shot back, &#34;If it weren&#39;t for you, I never would&#39;ve crossed paths with a lowlife like Rhys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis froze, her face twisting as if the words had struck a raw nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swallowed her temper with visible effort, then put on a pitiful pout and turned toward Josh. &#34;Dad, you saw how she spoke to me. I only introduced Rhys because | thought he was a decent man. I was trying to help her, but it all blew up in my face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s brows drew together. &#34;Enough. From now on, stop playing matchmaker for Gabriela,&#34; he said firmly.&#34;And work on your judgment before you go recommending anyone to her again.&#34; Privately, Josh felt a measure of relief-at least Gabriela hadn&#39;t gotten too entangled with Rhys. Otherwise,his collapse would&#39;ve taken her down too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis, however, was quite frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her mother buried in work until midnight most days, she had no one to join her in taking digs at Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even venting her irritation had become impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, seeing the disaster Rhys&#39;s family had brought upon themselves, she could only grit her teeth. It was a sobering reminder to think twice before crossing Gabriela again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela slipped back into her room without a hitch, a quiet thrill curling through her at the memory of Rhys finally getting what he deserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then a thought snagged in her mind-yesterday, Wesley had stepped in for her, and today, Rhys&#39;s downfall came like a hammer blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief, startling moment, she wondered if Wesley had orchestrated it all. With the kind of influence he wielded, wiping Rhys out would have been child&#39;s play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she gave a short laugh at herself and brushed the notion away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just a lowly secretary-why on earth would a man like him move mountains to settle her grudges?-Clearly, his recent flashes of kindness were making her entertain foolish ideas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela tapped her cheek ljghtly, as if scolding herself back to sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, the moment she stepped into the office, Aubrey caught her by the arm and leaned in, her voice pitched low. &#34;Have you seen the news? Rhys and his father got arrested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela gave a small nod. &#34;Mm-hm. I saw it last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Moss is truly impressive!&#34; Aubrey&#39;s eyes gleamed with mischief and excitement.&#34;Come on, Gabriela,what magic trick did you pull to make him value you this much? He&#39;s personally making sure Rhys is stuck in that police station. That bastard couldn&#39;t lay a finger on you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on!&#34; Gabriela cut her off in a rush, heat rising to her cheeks. &#34;Who says this has anything to do with Mr.Moss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, please.&#34; Aubrey tilted her head, a sly smile tugging at her lips. &#34;Rhys caused you trouble yesterday, and today he&#39;s damn well paying for it. Anyone with eyes can tell Mr. Moss had a hand in it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or maybe Rhys finally got what was coming to him for his vile acts!&#34; Gabriela shot back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey rolled her eyes. &#34;Does Mr. Moss know how stubbornly ungrateful you are? I&#39;m telling you, this was absolutely his doing. You&#39;d better start figuring out how you&#39;re going to thank him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after parting ways with Aubrey, Gabriela&#39;s heart continued its frantic rhythm, stubbornly ignoring her efforts to steady it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So it wasn&#39;t just her imagination-anyone in her shoes would have drawn the same conclusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still... was Wesley really the one pulling the strings?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, as she prepared his coffee, she found herself lingering near his desk, stealing quick, uncertain glances at him from the corner of her eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her restless presence, Wesley&#39;s brow furrowed and asked, &#34;Rough night? You look worn out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was up way too late studying the materials you gave me,&#34; Gabriela answered lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t push yourself too hard. You need sleep,&#34; he remarked, his tone carrying a quiet note of concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Gabriela had first stepped into the executive office, he&#39;d teased her with a challenge-memorize an entire stack of documents in just one day. Yet he&#39;d never once quizzed her on the material.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; Gabriela replied, though her fingers tightened around the folder in her hands. She wanted to ask about Rhys, but Wesley&#39;s cool, unréadable gaze kept the question locked in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time noon rolled around, she had already decided she&#39;d cook a spread worthy of a five-star chef,hoping to win his approval-and maybe slip in a few casual questions while his guard was down. But before she could set her plan in motion, Wesley glanced up and said flatly,&#34;We&#39;ll eat out today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela instantly began gathering his daily essentials-charger, cables, markers, stapler, two changes of clothes, even a pack of gum-moving with brisk efficiency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever Wesley had an outside engagement, the preparation felt less like office work and more like stocking an expedition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela couldn&#39;t help feeling more like a live-in housekeeper than an office secretary, grumbling under her breath that he might as well skip hiring a secretary altogether and just find himself a wife and put her on the payroll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She zipped the bag shut and turned-only to stop short. Wesley was right behind her, his tall frame casting a shadow over her, the quiet authority in his stance making the air between them hum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stiffened, a silent prayer flashing through her mind that he hadn&#39;t caught a single word of her muttered complaint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fate, however, wasn&#39;t feeling generous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All set?&#34; Wesley&#39;s voice carried a lazy edge, before his mouth curved in faint amusement. &#34;Instead of complaining, why not recruit me a spouse to do your work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heat rushed from her face to her knees, leaving them perilously weak. She had whispered so softly-how could he have heard every word?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Wesley didn&#39;t linger to savor her embarrassment. He simply strode out, his long frame exuding an air of satisfaction, as if her flustered reaction had set his mood alight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still unsettled, Gabriela hurried after him to the parking lot, where the sight of Billy behind the wheel caught her off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re coming with us today, Billy?&#34; she asked, brows lifting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy&#39;s easy smile reached his eyes as he extended a hand toward her. &#34;That&#39;s right. Let me take that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela figured she had probably crossed a line earlier, and Wesley had simply decided to leave her behind. She was about to pass the backpack over when Wesley&#39;s expression turned abruptly severe, the sharp crease in his brow making her freeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, she clutched the backpack tighter to her chest, her fingers tightening around the straps. &#34;I&#39;ll carry it. Really-it&#39;s no trouble. I&#39;m strong,&#34; she blurted, her voice soft but urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze flicked up to Wesley, searching for any sign of approval, silently pleading to prove she was more than capable-and that her earlier teasing hadn&#39;t jeopardized her position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s eyes stayed cool, his face unreadable, yet he didn&#39;t dismiss her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the small mercy, Gabriela quickly stepped forward to open the car door for him before slipping in quietly at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy, catching the crackle of tension in the air, kept his eyes on the road and his mouth shut, embodying the perfect,tight-lipped driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their ride ended at the Grace Robuchon-an exclusive, members-only sanctuary that welcomed only cardholders and the rare few personally invited by the restaurant itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The barrier to entry was sky-high, but for the elite, membership was more than a dining privilege; it was a gleaming badge of status. Its opulence outshone even the famed Gilded Fork, drawing in society&#39;s most influential players.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a man like Wesley, the place would gladly extend complimentary membership, fully aware that his presence alone could lure a wave of eager, deep-pocketed applicants-heirs to fortunes, industry tycoons,even A-list celebrities-each willing to part with millions in annual fees for the bragging rights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Okburg, a Grace Robuchon card wasn&#39;t just a key to fine dining; it was proof of being among the city&#39;s most influential.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, who had spent over two decades in the city without once holding one, was now stepping inside for the very first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the instant they crossed the threshold, the doorman greeted them with a practiced, welcoming smile,personally guiding them inside. Soon, Gabriela was seated in a private dining room reserved just for them, where a striking young waiter laid out appetizers and poured crystalline beverages, the soft strains of a live piano drifting in from the next room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting the bag higher on her shoulders, Gabriela felt its weight drag her firmly back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept in mind she was just Wesley&#39;s tagalong and dared not get ahead of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the instant her gaze landed on Mason, her resolve faltered, and her thoughts veered straight to the one-billion-dollar deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was her third encounter with him.</p>
