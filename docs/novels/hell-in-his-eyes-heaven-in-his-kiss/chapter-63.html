                <p>Gabriela hesitated, then asked in a low voice,&#34;Miriam, do you happen to have any warmer pajamas?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam&#39;s tone stayed light. &#34;No need, dear. The heating&#39;s more than enough to keep you cozy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been hoping for something with a bit more coverage, but as a guest, she couldn&#39;t bring herself to push. With a small nod, she accepted the slip dress without protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you be alright washing up on your own?&#34; Miriam asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; Gabriela answered quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d weathered far worse injuries on her own  before; this little sprain was nothing in comparison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s and Miriam&#39;s concern left her a little dazed,the warmth of their kindness pressing in on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam gave a reassuring nod. &#34;Go on and freshen up. I&#39;ll be right outside. There&#39;s shampoo and shower gel ready in the bathroom. Call me anytime if you need something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela murmured her thanks more than once before slipping into the bathroom with the slip dress draped over her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, she paused, once again struck by the opulence of the upper class-even the guest bathroom was larger than her entire bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though her foot ached, she felt oddly self-conscious about using the bathtub in Wesley&#39;s home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opting for the shower instead, she turned on the water. Standing was awkward and unsteady, and the process dragged on until she finally finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh from her shower, Gabriela slipped into the slip dress, a prickle of self-consciousness creeping over her at how little it actually covered. To her relief, she wouldn&#39;t have to step outside the room in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She towel-dried her hair as she stepped out of the bathroom-then froze mid-stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall man stood by the bed, his suit jacket draped neatly over a chair, fingers unclasping the strap of his watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound of movement, he turned his head, his hand stalling over the watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s breath caught. She whipped a hand over her eyes. Her voice wavered. &#34;M-Mr. Moss...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why on earth was he in her room? His white shirt hung open, every button undone, revealing a stretch of toned skin beneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait a second-this was her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she covering her eyes like a startled child when he was the one who&#39;d stumbled into the wrong room? Snapping back to her senses, Gabriela folded her arms tightly across her chest, her glare sharp enough to cut glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-what exactly do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34; she demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley, fresh from an intense meeting with his think tank, looked entirely unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a full day cramped in an airplane seat, all he&#39;d wanted was to sink into a scalding bath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who could possibly explain why Gabriela was in his room?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And why was she standing there in such a skimpy dress, hardly suited for the winter chill?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those long, delicate legs-how could she bare them so openly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden rush of heat burned through Wesley,and he jerked his gaze away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Care to explain why you&#39;re in my room?&#34; he asked. The irritation in his voice made Gabriela falter. Had she somehow wandered into the wrong place?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, that couldn&#39;t be-it was Miriam who had led her here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened and replied quickly, &#34;Miriam was the one who brought me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dull throb began to build behind Wesley&#39;s temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What on earth had Miriam been thinking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He refastened his shirt buttons with brisk, precise movements, then draped his &#39;suit jacket over Gabriela&#39;s shoulders before calling Miriam inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint edge in his voice, Wesley asked, &#34;She&#39;s a guest,Miriam.Why would you put her in here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam blinked, genuinely perplexed. &#34;Where else could she possibly stay? You brought her back, so it&#39;s only natural she stays in your room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massaging the bridge of his nose, Wesley replied with measured patience, &#34;Find her a guest room.&#34;  Having watched Wesley grow up, Miriam knew all too well that this stony look meant he was genuinely angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of disappointment passed through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d thought, for once, he might actually be falling for someone-but clearly, things had stalled halfway and now they were in separate rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; she said at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging her feet, Miriam went to prepare a guest room, only to find every available one tucked too far from Wesley&#39;s bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the trouble with a house this enormous-sometimes too much space just made things complicated. If there&#39;d only been a single room, she wouldn&#39;t be stuck with this dilemma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After pacing in indecision for a while, she returned and met Wesley&#39;s gaze. &#34;The guest rooms aren&#39;t ready. How about letting you and Gabriela share, at least for tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela gaped at her, stunned by Miriam&#39;s audacious proposal.Wesley didn&#39;t even like her-yet Miriam had the nerve to suggest something so outrageous.He&#39;d blow a fuse for sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True enough, his brow knit tighter, anger flashing in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wrapped in his jacket, Gabriela inched farther away,hoping to slip out of the blast radius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed at the awkward situation, aware she was partly to blame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d sensed something was wrong the moment she stepped into the room, so why had she gone ahead and showered?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First, there&#39;d been that beachside misunderstanding where she assumed Wesley was interested in her,and now this disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he so much as got the wrong idea, he would think she was an employee with ulterior motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her well-paid, twenty-eight-grand-a-month job suddenly felt as if it were dangling by a thread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley caught the flicker of emotions crossing Gabriela&#39;s face and let out a quiet sigh before declaring coolly, &#34;I&#39;ll take the study tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela blinked,momentarily thrown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was his bedroom-she couldn&#39;t just sprawl here as if it were hers, even if he wasn&#39;t using it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her teeter on the verge of tears, Miriam assumed Wesley&#39;s sharp tone had rattled her. She stepped closer, her voice warm with reassurance.&#34;It&#39;s fine, dear. I should&#39;ve planned the room assignments better. Sleep here for now, and l promise the best and largest guest room will be ready for you by tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stared at her, stunned. Tomorrow? She was expected to stay here another night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spending even a single night here had her pulse hammering so wildly she could hardly breathe.Another day under this roof and she might not make it to the end of the holidays-never mind the return to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need to trouble yourself..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine.&#34; Miriam cut in with brisk warmth. &#34;Just get some sleep. I&#39;ll run an extra quilt over to Wesley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quilt in hand, Miriam stepped out, a nagging thought tugging at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, her gaze had drifted to Gabriela-those elegant curves, that unmistakable hourglass frame.Her face was another kind of rare beauty entirely,the sort that lingered in memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, with such a breathtaking woman right here,Wesley had still chosen to sleep in thestudy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could the rumors be true-was Wesley really not interested in women? Was that the real reason he had never shown the slightest spark of interest in Gabriela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant who was responsible for parking Wesley&#39;s car vowed to hunt down the source of the rumors. Crouching around the corner, he caught every word of Miriam&#39;s under-the-breath musings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock nearly knocked him backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam and Wesley were practically family. He never imagined the rumors about Wesley had started with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,he wasn&#39;t about to invite trouble. With a wary glance over his shoulder, he melted into the shadows and slipped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Miriam smoothed the thick quilt across the study, her brow faintly furrowed. After a pause,she asked with quiet insistence, &#34;Why not just stay in the same room with Gabriela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley let out a slow, measured breath, his gaze steady as he answered, &#34;Keep things natural, Miriam.And for heaven&#39;s sake, don&#39;t frighten her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam&#39;s brows lifted in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the sound of it, he hadn&#39;t managed to win Gabriela over-so that was why he was choosing to sleep in the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of inspiration flashed through her mind,bright and sudden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware of any schemes brewing beyond the door,Gabriela remained frozen in place, hesitant to move.Only after several long moments did she dare inch toward the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could still picture Wesley standing there not long ago, sliding off his jacket with unhurried ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he had left, the cool, commanding air he carried seemed to linger in the room, wrapping around her like an invisible shroud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A charged, almost tangible energy clung to the air-the sheer presence of Wesley, the man who had set her pulse racing only hours earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing steady breaths, she lowered herself to the bed&#39;s edge, her tender ankle allowingno other option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mattress cradled her in decadent softness, far  more luxurious than she&#39;d imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After battling the pull of sleep for half an hour, her resistance faltered; with her eyes drifting shut, she surrendered to the comfort and let herself sink into slumber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she did, the earlier scene replayed vividly in her mind-Wesley&#39;s shirt hanging loose,revealing the firm, sculpted lines of muscle that carried both strength and an unspoken sense of safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even his waist had looked strong and lean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her palms over her face, a ripple of regret tugging at her. Why on earth had she covered her eyes with her hand?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would it really have mattered if she had stolen a few more glances?</p>
