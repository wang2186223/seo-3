                <p>The response landed in Gabriela&#39;s WhatsApp chat in the blink of an eye. &#34;Because you deserve it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she read those words, her vision blurred, tears stinging her eyes before she could blink them away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing up,her childhood closet had overflowed with beautiful dresses-at least, before Phyllis&#39;s family had moved in. After that, Phyllis snatched up her prettiest things,leaving Gabriela only what was outgrown or hopelessly worn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At school,even her classmates had teased, &#34;Gabriela,you&#39;re so lucky! Phyllis&#39;s family takes you in and gives you such nice clothes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever Gabriela tried to correct them,explaining they were all Phyllis&#39;s castoffs, she&#39;d be instantly scolded. &#34;You&#39;re an orphan. You should be grateful for whatever you get! Phyllis is being generous by sharing with you-stop complaining.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis, meanwhile, always put on a saintly face,stepping in with a gentle voice. &#34;Don&#39;t say that about Gabriela. She&#39;s a girl too-it&#39;s only natural for her to want to look nice.&#34; In the end, all Gabriela ever got from others was more ridicule and contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gradually, she&#39;d begun to accept that maybe she really was only worthy of Phyllis&#39;s hand-me-downs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never in her life had she imagined that one day, a well-known playboy would offer her sincere praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her phone stayed silent for a few moments,another WhatsApp message popped up. &#34;Why aren&#39;t you responding? Did you try on the dress? Does it suit you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brushing away her tears with the back of her hand,Gabriela typed quickly, &#34;Yes, I&#39;ve tried it on. It&#39;s gorgeous.I love it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s mouth quirked into a pleased,knowing smile.In his mind, anything he picked out was guaranteed to be flawless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, unable to contain her curiosity, responded,&#34;It fits like it was made for me. How did you know my size?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s gaze sharpened with a sly edge as he mused inwardly, &#34;I have already explored every inch of you with my own hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of that passionate night-her slender,warm body melting against his-sent a slow, burning heat through Wesley. He responded with deliberate ease, &#34;I&#39;m great at estimating measurements just by looking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s awesome. Thank you, Mr. Saunders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as Wesley read her reply,his mood turned stormy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d handpicked that dress himself, yet she was thanking Brenden? For a split second, his jaw tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, he fired off a curt message.&#34;It&#39;s not a present. Just something for you to wear at the banquet. Don&#39;t read too much into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela paused, thumbs hovering over the screen,bewildered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was going on? Had she somehow managed to offend him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With all the praise and thanks she&#39;d given,what could possibly have him so upset? Was her gratitude too vague? Or did he expect something more?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley grew annoyed when she didn&#39;t answer with the apology he was waiting for. With a calm but cold expression, he inhaled deeply and hit send on a new message. &#34;A dress isn&#39;t a big deal. I&#39;ve bought diamond necklaces and luxury jewelry for my thirty girlfriends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words landed like a cold slap, blatantly implying that Brenden spoiled his girlfriends with far grander tokens and that Gabriela had no reason to feel special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s mind reeled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d always heard whispers about Brenden&#39;s endless string of flings, but thirty girlfriends? Was that even possible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts snagged on the memory of that hotel room-the feel of his hard, sculpted muscles beneath her hands, the fierce, greedy way he&#39;d pulled her close.Heat flooded her cheeks despite herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet underneath that lingering warmth, an uneasy ache twisted in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, she couldn&#39;t deny it-just thinking about the way he&#39;d gripped her so fiercely and kissed her that night sent a little thrill racing through her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snapped back a bold reply. &#34;You&#39;re absolutely right, Mr. Saunders. You really do have deep pockets Hope your girlfriends will stick around to help you spend every last cent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley read.her comeback and knew, with a quiet satisfaction, that he&#39;d managed to erase whatever  fondness Gabriela might have felt for Brenden. The realization made his lips curve into a subtle, contented smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tapped out a message, measured and calm.&#34;The banquet&#39;s about to begin. Stay put. I&#39;ll come get you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy, glancing at Wesley in the rearview mirror,noticed the sudden ease in his boss&#39;s expression and silently let out the breath he&#39;d been holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just moments ago,Wesley&#39;s thunderous mood,fueled by the tense messages on his phone, had cast a heavy chill over the entire car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gathering his courage, Billy asked in a coreful tone,&#34;Shall we make our way to the banquet now, Mr.iloss?&#34;</p>
