                <p>Nestled inside the box was a modest, unremarkable bracelet, its only decoration a tiny Cupid charm dangling from the chain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stared at it in disbelief, turning the box this way and that, even tilting it as if a more impressive gift might be hidden beneath the velvet lining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no matter how many times she checked, the truth remained-this was all there was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For God&#39;s sake! While her colleagues unwrapped company gifts worth over a thousand dollars, all she got was some flimsy fifty-dollar bracelet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this Wesley&#39;s way of getting back at her for that humiliating incident a few days ago-falling asleep in his bed and embarrassing him in front of his elite think tank?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew the man too well. Wesley Moss never forgot a slight, and he certainly wasn&#39;t the type to forgive without extracting his own quiet revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that anticipation had fizzled into disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone suddenly chimed, and a WhatsApp message from Aubrey popped up, asking if she&#39;d unwrapped her gift yet. &#34;Plenty of colleagues are posting theirs and singing Mr. Moss&#39;s praises. You&#39;d better get yours up too-show some loyalty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stared at the screen, her mood too sour for such theatrics. She tapped back a curt, &#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It struck her then-Aubrey had joined the company only a few days after she had. Aubrey&#39;s gift was the standard year-end gift, and Gabriela had been truly happy for her. So why was she the only one singled out for something different?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought left her with a hollow, unsettled feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, she walked into the office with a faint heaviness lingering in her chest. As she lingered by the elevator, Gabriela crossed paths with Aubrey, who was beaming. Aubrey chattered away about how she&#39;d given Kevin the watch last night and how he&#39;d been thrilled with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention made Gabriela think of her own plain, unimpressive bracelet, and a wave of bitterness curled in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the faint shadow in Gabriela&#39;s expression, Aubrey tilted her head. &#34;You look exhausted, Gabriela.Rough night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela hesitated, then asked, &#34;Did everyone get the same year-end gift?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey tilted her head, puzzled. &#34;It was either cosmetics or a watch for everyone...&#34; She suddenly blinked,eyes widening in surprise. &#34;Hold on-don&#39;t tell me your gift wasn&#39;t the same as ours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela sighed, her expression shadowed with disappointment. &#34;My gift is neither cosmetics nor a watch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey leaned in, intrigued. &#34;Come on, tell me-what did Mr. Moss end up giving you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A simple bracelet, nothing fancy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brows lifting, Aubrey stared. &#34;You&#39;re joking. Not even a pendant with it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was puzzling-Wesley had been showering the staff with high-end cosmetics and stylish watches. Why would Gabriela be singled out for something so plain? The thought didn&#39;t sit right with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her expression downcast, Gabriela muttered, &#34;Just a plain bracelet, a tiny Cupid charm on it... came in a pretty little box,that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey tilted her head, frowning for a moment before her eyes brightened. &#34;You know what Cupid stands for...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t even start. No way.&#34; Gabriela&#39;s tone was firm, cutting Aubrey off mid-thought. &#34;Let&#39;s not spin this into something it isn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To someone like Wesley, a gift so ordinary could only be a quiet nudge-straighten up at work or watch your perks shrink away. There was no chance it carried the meaning Aubrey-or her own wandering mind-was trying to pin on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey tilted her head, curiosity flickering in her eyes. &#34;So what&#39;s the deal? Why would Mr. Moss hand you a bracelet like that?&#34; Her suspicion deepened. &#34;Don&#39;t tell me there wasn&#39;t some other meaning behind it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela gave a wry smile and recounted what had happened the other day. &#34;I&#39;d been drinking too much and somehow ended up crawling into Mr. Moss&#39;s lounge bed. When I woke up, I bolted out of there barefoot and ran into him during a meeting with his think tank... Mr. Moss must be upset with me about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey sensed holes in the story but couldn&#39;t quite pin them down. In the end, she only gave Gabriela a half-grinning thumbs-up. &#34;You&#39;ve got guts, Gabriela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back, Gabriela murmured with a hint of gloom, &#34;Truth is, I only drank that day to keep things smooth with Mr. Garner. But instead of remembering what I did right, Mr. Moss just clings to my one mistake and won&#39;t drop it. Honestly, he&#39;s so petty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator chimed, and she and Aubrey stepped inside, Aubrey murmuring a few more words of comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Gabriela reached the CEO&#39;s office,Wesley had already been there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face was set in a grim line, a faint shadow of displeasure in his eyes. She offered a polite greeting,but he breezed past as if he hadn&#39;t heard a thing, peeling off his coat and diving straight into work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppressing a sigh, Gabriela slipped into the kitchen and set about brewing his coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, she placed the steaming cup on his desk. &#34;Your coffee, Mr. Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if the year-end gift let her down, she still had to guard her generous.paycheck like her life depended on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela brushed off her sour mood and slipped seamlessly into her usual, razor-sharp work rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the desk, Wesley shut the file with deliberate finality, his fingers drumming against the polished surface. His eyes were cool as winter steel. &#34;Not happy with the present you got yesterday?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of the present made heat rush to her chest. She&#39;d swallowed her feelings all night,but now that he&#39;d brought it up, the words tumbled out before she could stop them.&#34;So why was I the only one who His gaze hardened instantly, shadows cutting across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In this entire executive office, aside from Tessa and Billy, you&#39;re the highest-paid employee here,&#34; he said,each word clipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet she&#39;d still had the nerve to call him petty behind his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s voice tightened with quiet indignation. &#34;I&#39;m not just your secretary-I&#39;m also your cook and housekeeper. I often work overtime deep into the night with you. And now, everyone else gets the same gift while mine&#39;s different. How do you think that makes me look in front of my colleagues? They&#39;ll start doubting whether I can even do my job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley let out a low, mocking chuckle. &#34;And remind me-how exactly did you land a spot in the executive office?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The insinuation hit like a slap, as if he&#39;d just declared she&#39;d gotten here through anything but skill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind flashed to those damning WhatsApp screenshots, souring her mood even further. She muttered,&#34;I apologize for speaking poorly about you behind your back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze sharpened, a faint smirk playing on his lips. &#34;Oh? So you&#39;re not scared of me anymore? Already bold enough to talk back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela kept her lips pressed shut, unwilling to risk another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley-craving both praise and submission from those around him-was as conceited as he was domineering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey had even hinted that he might be a little interested in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If this was his idea of showing interest, she didn&#39;t dare imagine how ruthless he&#39;d be if he wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s gaze lingered on her bowed head, her downcast eyes, and that flicker of defiance she was swallowing back. The combination made him smirk. He said, voice firm and unyielding. &#34;Wear the bracelet on your right wrist tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way he issued the order left no room for discussion, and Gabriela knew without a doubt-he was doing this purely to toy with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing that bracelet would be like announcing to the entire company that she hadn&#39;t received a proper gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her shoulders sinking, she managed a quiet, &#34;Yes, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, Aubrey clocked out alongside Gabriela and coaxed her into a shopping trip, suggesting they get their hair done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once the holiday starts, I&#39;ll be spending eight full days with Kevin in Dialand! No way I&#39;m showing up looking anything less than perfect,&#34; Aubrey said wwith a wink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For many office workers, getting a fresh hairstyle before the New Year was almost a sacred tradition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Gabriela&#39;s paycheck still hadn&#39;t come through, and the knot of worry in her stomach kept her from spending freely. She passed on the salon and settled for picking out two new outfits instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, she and Aubrey tucked into a steaming pot of stew, the rich aroma and easy chatter finally sweeping away the last of her gloom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, stretched out in bed, Gabriela absently scrolled through her WhatsApp messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden&#39;s name still sat there,stubbornly silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The promise he&#39;d made to be her plus-one at the wedding now felt like nothing more than a careless remark tossed into the air-words he&#39;d never intended to keep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed as if misfortune had been dogging her heels for weeks. Once the holiday break came,she vowed,she&#39;d book a long meditation session and scrub the bad energy from her life like dust from a mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Brenden, feeling just as cursed by fate, grudgingly shoveled up yet another mound of dirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For nearly half a month, he&#39;d been toiling under the watchful eye of the team leader, clawing his way barely two meters down-still without a trace of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More and more, he wondered if the leader and Wesley had conspired to keep him trapped in this grueling task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a grunt, he flung another load of dirt aside, his clothes and hair caked in dust, and glanced up at the well walls towering above his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought struck him with grim humor-this didn&#39;t feel like digging for water anymore. It felt like he was carving out his own grave.</p>
