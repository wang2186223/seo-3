                <p>Wesley, though visibly irked, swallowed his frustration with Loretta. He forced out a measured response.&#34;Grandma, there are company rules. You&#39;ll need to schedule an appointment to see me, no exceptions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta wouldn&#39;t let it go. Her tone sharpened with disapproval. &#34;Fiona&#39;s your friend. Why on earth would she need to book an appointment?&#34; Her voice climbed another notch,fraught with indignation.&#34;Tell me,are you saying I&#39;d have to make an appointment just to see my own grandson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined not to provoke her, Wesley softened his reply. &#34;No, of course not...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, that&#39;s what I thought. And you&#39;d better look after Fiona while she&#39;s there.&#34; Before Wesley could offer another word, Loretta ended the call with a decisive click.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left staring at the silent phone, he mulled over his next move, still scrambling for a way to keep Fiona out of his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela knocked politely, then entered the office. &#34;Mr. Moss, there&#39;s a woman outside-she says you two are close and insists on seeing you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley hadn&#39;t expected Fiona to show up so soon. His fingers drummed a restless beat on the desk before he forced his voice steady. &#34;Tell her I&#39;ve got a video meeting. Take her to the lounge for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a composed nod, Gabriela led Fiona down the hall, quietly mentioning that Wesley was currently tied up with work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona, wrapped in a chic, delicate dress that barely shielded her from the biting wind, had made her way to Apex Group determined. Unexpected, she was greeted by a striking young woman-Gabriela-whose beauty needed no help from cosmetics, her complexion luminous and unblemished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confronted by such effortless elegance, Fiona felt a pang of insecurity twist through her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela found herself under Fiona&#39;s sharp, appraising stare. With a tone dripping arrogance, Fiona ordered,&#34;Go make me a coffee. And make it just the way Wesley likes it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard by Fiona&#39;s easy command, Gabriela managed a polite, practiced smile. &#34;Of course.Please wait a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried off, brewing the coffee exactly to Wesley&#39;s tastes before carefully setting the cup in front of Fiona.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as Fiona took a sip, her face twisted in disgust. Without warning, she spat the coffee directly onto Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hot liquid splatteredacross Gabriela&#39;s pristine white dress, soaking the fabric and blooming into a bold, ugly stain. She didn&#39;t cry out-years of enduring worse back in school had taught her restraint. Instead, she calmly took a step back, her face unreadable even as her immaculate appearance was ruined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trying to scald me on purpose, are you?&#34; Fiona pounced on Gabriela before she could react, voice dripping with contempt. &#34;Unbelievable. You&#39;re this clumsy, yet you landed a spot in the executive office? What dirty tricks did you pull to get hired?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela,having survived yearsof Phyllis&#39;s schemes, recognized animosity when she sawit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what had she done to provoke Fiona? For crying out loud! They&#39;d never crossed paths before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although irritation simmered beneath her calm exterior, Gabriela kept her tone steady. &#34;I was assigned heréthrough proper channels and all the standard procedures. If you&#39;re that curious, Ms. Dewitt, feel free to check with HR.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona&#39;s gaze narrowed, laced with biting contempt. &#34;Who said you could open your mouth? Don&#39;t think a pretty face and a little support from above can cover up how useless you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Billy strode in, his brows knitting together as he took in Gabriela&#39;s stained dress. &#34;What&#39;s going on here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Gabriela could answer, Fiona lunged forward. &#34;Mr. Clarke, is the executive office in the habit of hiring based on looks? She&#39;s unbelievable-she nearly dumped coffee all over me on purpose! I suggest you fire her immediately, or I&#39;ll take this straight to Wesley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy ignored Fiona&#39;s accusations, simply offering her a courteous nod before turning to Gabriela. &#34;Come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela trailed behind Billy to the CEO&#39;s office. Wesley ended his call and set the phone aside, his gaze sharpening as Billy quietly summarized the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s face clouded with displeasure. &#34;Get her a clean set of clothes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; Billy immediately strode out to take care of it himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the office empty, Wesley&#39;s attention landed on Gabriela. &#34;Well? Don&#39;t you have anything to say for yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s shoulders stiffened as she met his eyes, refusing to answer. She pressed her lips together in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was there to say? Fiona&#39;s accusations were nothing but thinly veiled malice, and Gabriela had only swallowed her pride for the sake of her paycheck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley fixed her with a look of quiet reproach. &#34;You&#39;re my personal secretary. If you let someone walk all over you, it reflects poorly on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of embarrassment crept into her cheeks at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Fiona&#39;s overly familiar tone when addressing Wesley suggested that they were close. With such a dynamic, how was Gabriela, a secretary, supposed to stand her ground?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Wesley retrieved an official-looking document from his desk and handed it to Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took the document without hesitation, eyes scanning the bold print at the top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a company-wide mandate urging all departments to cut back on water and electricity use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley spoke with crisp authority. &#34;I&#39;Il set the standard-starting with the CEO&#39;s office. Go turn off the heat. Make sure every department gets the message, and tell them I expect full cooperation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela gathered herself and strode out, still thrown by the sudden assignment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She barely had time to process it before Billy showed up holding a fresh change of clothes. Grateful,Gabriela slipped away to the restroom, changed quickly, and then made the rounds, personally delivering the directive to each department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The collective groan rippled through the office, but with Wesley leading the charge, even the most reluctant employees bundled up in heavy coats and shut off the heaters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the lounge, Fiona shivered as the room grew steadily colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her coffee lost its warmth with each passing minute, and she silently cursed herself for not finishing it while it was still hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,with Billy and Gabriela gone, no one bothered to check on her. Isolated and freezing, Fiona&#39;s irritation simmered into rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swore to herself she&#39;d get them tossed out once she had the chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela returned from distributing the notices just as Wesley handed her a new assignment, his voice tinged with mischief. &#34;Head to the lounge and watch the show. Things are about to getinteresting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela couldn&#39;t decipher Wesley&#39;s real agenda, but after mulling it over, she suspected Fiona was just another persistent admirer whom he wanted her to quietly drive away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, in this place, every ounce of value was squeezed from her. That generous salary came with more strings attached than she&#39;d bargained for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She eased open the lounge door an&#39;d spotted Fiona perched stiffly on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even bundled up, Gabriela felt the icy bite of winter pressing through the walls, but Fiona, who&#39;d sacrificed warmth for style, sat trembling-her teeth nearly chattering as she struggled to look unfazed.The whole scene struck Gabriela as oddly amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had she stepped inside than Fiona shot her a disgruntled glare. &#34;Why did someone shut off the heat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela knew she couldn&#39;t blurt out that Wesley wanted to cut costs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she put on a professional face and offered a harmless excuse. &#34;The heating system&#39;s out. We&#39;ve already called for repairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona&#39;s icy glare made it obvious she didn&#39;t believe a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought Gabriela was throwing her weight around just to make her uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who did this secretary think she was, daring to challenge her for Wesley&#39;s attention?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting the tense set of Fiona&#39;s jaw, Gabriela kept her tone light but couldn&#39;t resist. &#34;It&#39;s freezing in here.Are you sure you don&#39;t want to put on something warmer, Ms. Dewitt?&#34; A flicker of concern crossed her face. &#34;You&#39;re looking a little pale.Are you feeling under the weather?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Billy stepped in, barely suppressing a laugh behind a forced cough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela wasted no time, her tone light but pointed. &#34;See? You&#39;ve already managed to pass it on to Billy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona&#39;s composure shattered. Her cheeks flushed a furious crimson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had battled the bitter wind outside just to look flawless for Wesley-certainly not to become the punchline of Gabriela&#39;s barbs.</p>
