                <p>Chapter89 Could Brenden Have A Split Personality</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Wesley finished his words, Gabriela stayed composed-but Brenden looked as if he&#39;d just been struck,staring at her in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d only told her not to contact him anymore,and she&#39;d gone and given the scarf to his cousin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she had been rejected, shouldn&#39;t there have been a period of quiet heartbreak, of struggling to move on before starting something new?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resentment burned in Brenden as he glared at Gabriela through the entire dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, meanwhile, felt tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew she shouldn&#39;t have agreed to Loretta&#39;s request-Brenden was clearly unhappy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he broadcast their one-night stand now, she could It lose her job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided to placate him. &#34;Mr. Saunders, you seem unwell. Are your legs bothering you? I know a way to ease the pain...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden scoffed coldly. &#34;No need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she no longer cared for him, why pretend to be concerned?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s expression shifted as well. He glanced at Brenden&#39;s shorter legs, then at his own longer ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What&#39;s wrong with having long legs? Why didn&#39;t Gabriela like them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, Gabriela wanted to clarify the scarf misunderstanding to keep Brenden from saying anything reckless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden was lurking near the artificial rock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could approach, he waved her off dramatically. &#34;Stay back. Since you chose to give the scarf to Wesley, commit to him fully.&#34; Gabriela hurried to explain, &#34;Mr.Saunders,you&#39;ve got it wrong. It&#39;s not what you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden&#39;s mind raced with an audacious thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Gabriela given the scarf to his cousin deliberately to spark his jealousy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To capture his attention, she dared to provoke Wesley.How bold!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a grave expression, Brenden said, &#34;Gabriela,Wesley&#39;s not someone to trifle with. Keep your distance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he losing it? Why was he saying things she couldn&#39;t understand?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden continued, &#34;I stand by what I said. Do not approach me in private again. And don&#39;t provoke Wesley again, whatever your motives. Understood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His warning tone weighed heavily on Gabriela. She knew Brenden wouldn&#39;t just stand by if she got close to Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly clarified, &#34;Your grandmother asked me to deliver the scarf...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want excuses. Leave,&#34; he insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go, but can you promise not to tell Mr. MosS about us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden&#39;s eyes widened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was using Wesley to make him jealous but feared Wesley finding out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So timid, yet she&#39;d gone to such lengths for him.How could he betray her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bristled. &#34;What do you take me for? You think I&#39;d spread gossip like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Brenden&#39;s assurance, Gabriela was eager to put distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Wesley had been quietly pleased with the scarf-yet as dinner concluded, Gabriela&#39;s attention never once flickered in his direction.  His mood soured further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Post-dinner, he skipped reading and an important gathering, choosing to change in his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at the scarf, his irritation grew. He grabbed his phone and messaged Gabriela. &#34;Can&#39;t sleep.Read something to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela regretted not recording their earlier talk when she received the WhatsApp message from &#34;NotASaunders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined not to give in, she sent a voice message.&#34;You jerk! Get one of your friends to read to you.l warn you, if you harass me again, you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unsatisfied, she resolved to confront Brenden in person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Brenden was being pulled by Loretta for more exercise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His legs trembled, and using a bathroom break as an excuse,he rushed to Wesley for help. He hoped Wesley could intervene. Continuing like this would leave him exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wesley, save me!&#34; Brenden burst into Wesley&#39;s room without knocking, as was his habit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He overheard a voice message on Wesley&#39;s phone.&#34;You jerk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley didn&#39;t seem offended. In fact, he looked almost pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who was this woman daring to scold Wesley? The voice sounded familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that wasn&#39;t the point. Brenden realized that Wesley really enjoyed being scolded. But only by women,perhaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you knock?&#34; Wesley asked, frowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under that cold gaze, Brenden&#39;s back straightened.He blurted an apology and hurried out to process this new information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley rubbed his temple and locked the door. Brenden&#39;s manners were atrocious-perhaps he needed not just a trainer, but an etiquette tutor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Gabriela came looking for Brenden, she found his door wide open. He sat on the bed, muttering to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t make out every word, but caught fragments. &#34;I was wrong... Only by women...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill crept over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Brenden a completely different person at night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could he have a split personality? Or was there some mental disorder at play?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did he seem like one person in the daylight and someone entirely different once night fell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slowly backed away, holding her breath, and returned to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How terrifying!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Moss family was full of secrets; and she&#39;d only been here a few days. If they realized how much she knew, would they silence her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought sent another shiver down her spine as she looked again at the reading request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shouldn&#39;t provoke someone who might have two personalities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up her phone, she sent a new voice message in a softer tone. &#34;Mr. Saunders, I wasn&#39;t in a good mood earlier. My tone was harsh. I&#39;m sorry. Which book would you like me to read?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley listened to the deliberately sweetened voice and let out a cold laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He typed out a line from the book, instructing her to find that exact edition. &#34;But every once in a while,you find someone who&#39;s iridescent, and when you do,nothing will ever compare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was from a book she had once loved, but had lost and nearly forgotten. &#34;I don&#39;t have that book with me,&#34;she typed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reply came fast, sharper than before. &#34;If you don&#39;t have it, find a way to get it. Apex Group hired you to solve problems, not make excuses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was Brenden suddenly angry?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And besides, it was Wesley who paid her salary, not him. Being his cousin didn&#39;t make him special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was willing to challenge anyone-except Brenden, whose mind she wasn&#39;t sure about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding the book online, she started reading to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was bright with a touch of sweetness,pleasant to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Wesley took no enjoyment from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she surrendering to his demands so effortlessly? Did no one ever teach her she was allowed to say no? Worse still, after all this time, she still hadn&#39;t remembered anything about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her memory had more holes than the scarf she&#39;d knitted!</p>
