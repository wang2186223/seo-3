                <p>As Rhys sat brooding in his hospital bed, plotting his next move against Gabriela, she moved about the kitchen, quietly preparing breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing Wesley had grown accustomed to fine dining, she opted for something modest yet thoughtful-assembling a crisp sandwich and tucking a neatly wrapped box of muffins into a bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis, passing by, caught sight of Gabriela busy in the kitchen in the soft morning light, with their chef stationed nearby, occasionally offering a word of praise for her cooking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the living room, Josh lounged with a newspaper in hand, the faint curve of approval on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of yesterday-Josh openly siding with Gabriela and even striking her-gnawed at Phyllis,stoking both envy and bitterness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped just outside the kitchen doorway, careful to keep her voice out of Josh&#39;s earshot, and drawled with a smirk, &#34;Some people are just dramatic-cooking for themselves when they could have it done for them.Youactually think cooking for us will earn you brownie points?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela glanced over her shoulder, a faint, mocking smile tugging at her lips. &#34;Does it still hurt?&#34; she asked,her tone laced with deliberate sweetness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phylis&#39;s expression froze, her jaw tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course it still hurt-how could it not?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After losing a fistful of hair, her scalp still throbbed and stung, the skin raw where it had bled. The ache had kept her awake all night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t even gone looking for påyback-yet Gabriela had the nerve to bring it up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s face warped with pure hatred, but Gabriela only curved her lips into a cool, taunting smile. &#34;Keep running that filthy mouth, and I&#39;ll gladly rip out another handful for my collection.&#34; The memory of Gabriela&#39;s unflinching ferocity in past fights made Phyllis&#39;s bravado crumble. She automatically shuffled backward until she judged the distance safe, then hurled a weak insult from afar.&#34;You bitch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela didn&#39;t so much as blink. As long as Phyllis kept her distance, petty name-calling barely registered.She grabbed her packed breakfast, bid Josh a brisk farewell, and headed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she stepped into the company&#39;s plaza, a figure suddenly darted toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gabriela!&#34; Aubrey hurriedly called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She skidded to a stop, grabbing Gabriela by the arms and giving her an almost comically thorough once-over, as if checking for any injuries. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry! I ducked out of work early yesterday and had no clue someone was giving you trouble,&#34; she gushed, shaking her head.e you sure you&#39;re okay? I heard Rhys went after you-did he hurt you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; Gabriela assured her, her tone calm. &#34;I haven&#39;t got so much as a bruise. Really, there&#39;s no need to worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey let out a long breath, her shoulders easing. &#34;Good. I also heard Mr. Moss swooped in to help you yesterday.He even drove you home afterward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then leaned in with a teasing glint in her eyes. &#34;Did any sparks happen to fly between you two?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela shot her a weary, unamused glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she realized Aubrey&#39;s concern was just an excuse to dig for more gossip about her and Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t give me that look,&#34; Aubrey chided, undeterred. She tilted her head, a knowing smile playing on her lips. &#34;You know how Mr. Moss is-cold as ice with thestaff. So why would he step in for you unless...&#34; Her grin widened as she went on, &#34;He&#39;s into you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela opened her mouth to deny it, but the memory of Wesley&#39;s cool, unreadable expression gave her pause. It was true-he rarely involved himself with others, yet he had stepped in for her, then given her a ride home. That uncharacteristic kindness left her strangely unsettled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, that dreamy look gives you away completely.&#34; Aubrey popped up in front of Gabriela with a mischievous grin. &#34;All right, out with it-are you and Mr. Moss secretly dating?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely not!&#34; Gabriela countered without missing a beat. &#34;Keep gossiping about him in here, and you&#39;ll.be packing your things by day&#39;s end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not gossiping about him,&#34; Aubrey remarked, feigning wounded innocence. &#34;I&#39;m gossiping about my best friend. Word is, Mr. Moss swooped in last night like some gallant knight-it was legendary! So, tell me,did he win your heart or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, unable to endure another round of her friend&#39;s relentless prying, turned on her heel. &#34;I&#39;m going to be late. I need to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey, undeterred, trailed after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they stepped into the company lobby, Aubrey toned herself down, not daring to breathe Wesley&#39;s name again. But the moment she spotted an empty hallway, she leaned closer and lowered her voice. &#34;I&#39;ve got news for you. You&#39;ve been keeping tabs on Mr. Saunders, right? They&#39;re saying he might be coming back soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of delight lit Gabriela&#39;s eyes as she replied, &#34;For real?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since Brenden had tattled to Wesley with their WhatsApp chat screenshots, she&#39;d barely spoken to him online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just last night, Josh had spent hours weeping into her ear until she finally promised she&#39;d bring a boyfriend home for him. In a moment of weakness, she&#39;d messaged Brenden to ask when he was coming back, yet the chat remained unanswered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had resigned herself to the idea that he wouldn&#39;t be coming back this year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet here was a flicker of possibility. Could Wesley have decided to let him off the hook?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned forward, quick to press. &#34;Who told you that? Any idea exactly when Mr. Saunders will be back?&#34; Aubrey tilted her head with a smug little grin. &#34;Oh, now you&#39;re suddenly all chatty with me? I&#39;ll trade you that news for a few juicy details about you and Mr. Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela let out a dry laugh, rolling her eyes. &#34;Mr. Moss is my boss. My heart practically sops whenever he&#39;s in the same room. Is that enough for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey responded with a smirk, &#34;Mm-hmm. That&#39;s not enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela pressed on, her voice edged with impatience. &#34;Just answer me-are you certain Mr. Saunders is really coming back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you working right in the executive office? Why not go straight to the source and ask someone who actually knows?&#34; Aubrey prodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They carried on, laughing andtrading remarks, unaware that just around the corner, Wesley stood in the shadows, his gaze icy and his very presence radiating a sharp,frigid weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next to him, Billy froze, throat tightening, too afraid to even swallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since when had Gabriela grown so familiar with Brenden? And why did she seem to care so much about his return? Was she like all those other women, drawn in by Brenden&#39;s easy charm and striking looks, harboring a secret crush?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more the thought gnawed at him, the tighter unease coiled in Billy&#39;s gut. One glance at Wesley&#39;s stormy expression, and he prayed-desperately-that his suspicions were wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Gabriela stepped into the office, she halted mid-stride, startled to see Wesley already there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She instinctively straightened her posture, forcing her voice into a polite calm. &#34;Good morning,Mr.Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was i the middle of slipping off his suit jacket. At her voice, his head tilted, eyes narrowing in a cool,detached glance that felt as sharp as ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved forward at once, taking the jacket from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up close, his height felt even more imposing, his tall frame radiating a quiet authority that was impossible to ignore. That single, downward flick of his gaze carried a chill sharp enough to make her spine prickle. Gabriela&#39;s legs felt unsteady, as though the strength had been drained from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She secretly wondered who&#39;d crossed him this early in the morning-before the workday had even begun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing a smile onto her lips, she inquired, &#34;Have you had breakfast yet, Mr. Moss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley gave no reply, his expression carved from stone as he settled into the black swivel chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still clutching his jacket, Gabriela lingered in place, unsure whether to stepo forward or retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his current demeanor, would it even be wise to offer the breakfast she&#39;d prepared? He&#39;d turned it down before without a second glance, and now, with his mood this foul, he might very well toss it into the trash without so much as lifting the lid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner of his eye, Wesley noticed her standing there, head bowed like a reprimanded schoolgirl.Instead of softening, his annoyance sharpened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d sworn she would repay him, yet all she seemed intent on was sniffing around for news about Brenden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela studied his expression, searching for the smallest crack in that wall of cool detachment. &#34;Mr.Moss,&#34; she ventured softly. &#34;Would you like some coffee this morning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s jaw tightened. Was this just another ploy, a convenient excuse for her to leave his office and dig for more news about Brenden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought alone made his frustration boil over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his expression grow colder, Gabriela drew in a slow, steady breath before pulling two elegantly wrapped boxes from her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made this for you this morning. Would you like to try it?&#34; she asked, her voice careful yet hopeful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if he dumped it without a second thought, at least he&#39;d know she had risen before dawn to prepare it for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surely, that effort was worth some acknowledgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s gaze dropped to the boxes at last. &#34;You made this?&#34; &#34;I did,&#34; Gabriela answered at once, catching the faint shift in his demeanor. &#34;I got up early to make it. Didn&#39;t you mention you prefer lighter meals? The egg in this sandwich is fresh off the pan-soft, not greasy-so you won&#39;t have to worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes shone with quiet anticipation, hoping for a word of praise, and to her relief, the heaviness in Wesley&#39;s mood seemed to ease, if only slightly.</p>
