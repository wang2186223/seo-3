                <p>Gabriela glanced up and found herself staring straight into Wesley&#39;s sharply defined, irritable features. One look, and she knew she&#39;d wandered straight into a hornet&#39;s nest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden had already managed to provoke Wesley and been transferred on the spot. Determined to keep Wesley from suspecting her connection to Brenden,Gabriela rushed to distance herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re mistaken, Mr. Moss. There&#39;s nobody here l care about more than you,&#34; she blurted, pouring as much sincerity as she could muster into her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second the words left her mouth, she realized how misleading they sounded, and she fumbled for a way to explain. But then she caught a subtle shift in Wesley&#39;s expression-the faintest trace of satisfaction breaking through his annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s eyes went wide with disbelief</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So even someone as cold and untouchable as Wesley enjoyed a little flattery?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was a revelation-a secret window into a side of  him she&#39;d never seen before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to make the most of it, she pressed on.&#34;Honestly, you look extra sharp and energized today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley straightened, giving a soft cough as if feeling shy. &#34;Oh? Is that so? What makes you say that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela froze for half a second, realizing Wesley wasn&#39;t the type to accept half-baked compliments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cranked up the flattery, her voice sugary-sweet.&#34;Truly, Mr. Moss, you&#39;re the whole package. You walk into a room and everyone else just fades into the background. No wonder people fall for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quick thinking saved her yet again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though her compliments were blatantly over the top, Wesley actually looked pleased. &#34;At least you know quality when you see it,&#34; he replied, his tone lighter than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he strode off, leaving Gabriela with a sense of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy Clarke, Wesley&#39;s ever-serious assistant, stared at Gabriela in shock like she&#39;d just performed some kind of magic trick. He stole a few more incredulous glances her way, struggling to process what he&#39;d just seen. How had she managed to serve up such cringe-worthy praise-and not only get away with it,but somehow put Wesley in a good mood?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As far as Billy could remember, Wesley had always been cold toward his employees. Yet somehow,Gabriela managed to earn his favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy quietly filed Gabriela away in his mind as someone to watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Wesley was gone, Gabriela hurried to unlock her phone and returned to editing her message to Brenden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only	thendid she	notice	his	new username: &#34;NotASaunders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The update made her do a double take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was that supposed to mean? She was confused,but she quickly pushed the matter to the back of her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitantly, she typed, &#34;Mr. Saunders, are you busy right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost instantly, a reply came back. &#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela couldn&#39;t risk approaching Brenden directly,fearful that her involvement with him would be  exposed. She sent another message. &#34;When do you have a moment? I need to swing by and píck up what I left behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, the chat stayed silent. No answer came,no matter how long she stared at her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the meantime, Brenden hadn&#39;t even finished emptying his desk before Billy swept in, practically marching him out of the office and shoving him straight into a waiting car-no chance to say goodbye,not even a backward glance at his old team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange unease gnawed at Brenden&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley had looked him in the eye and promised a promotion-sworn he had a bright future. But why did it feel like there were landmines buried beneath every step from here on out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t dare voice his doubts. All he could do was grit his teeth and follow orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela,meanwhile,still hadn&#39;t managed to retrieve her belongings. She trudged home,heavy-hearted,only to walk through the door and be greeted by a cheerful Phyllis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guess what, Gabriela? Dustin asked me to marry him,and the wedding&#39;s set for next month!&#34; Phyllis lounged across the living room sofa, her hand outstretched to show off a monstrous diamond ring. The stone glittered ostentatiously as she gushed, &#34;He absolutely insisted on getting me this one-ten whole carats! He must have dropped a fortune. Isn&#39;t it gigantic? Do you think it&#39;s too much to wear around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis loved to put on a sweet, innocent front for the world, but behind closed doors, she never bothered to hide her nastiest side from Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The diamond perched on her finger was absurdly oversized, sparkling obnoxiously under the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela offered a bland smile. &#34;It&#39;s honestly way too much. If I didn&#39;t know you, l&#39;d assume you bought it just to flaunt. But that&#39;s exactly your style. The bigger and flashier, the better for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s lips twisted, her temper barely in check. you actually jealous? Maybe you should focus on finding a boyfriend of your own, so I don&#39;t have to worry about you making a move on mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela fired back without missing a beat, &#34;Please.The only one in this room desperate enough to steal someone&#39;s boyfriend is you. Trust me, your guy is the last person I&#39;d go after.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s expression hardened, her tone growing icy.&#34;Still pretending to be tough? From what I hear,your company&#39;s crawling with single guys. They may not measure up to Dustin, but they&#39;re enough for you. Just find anyone who&#39;s halfway decent and call it a day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis gave Gabriela a once-over, her gaze sharp and full of hidden malice. &#34;With your situation, Gabriela,you should really just settle for someone ordinary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in school, Gabriela had always attracted her share of admirers. Out of sheer envy, she&#39;d cooked up ugly rumors-accusing Gabriela of chasing money and even whispering that she secretly worked nights at a bar as an escort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers like that, repeated over and over, always found someone willing to believe them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Little by little, the decent guys who&#39;d onceliked Gabriela started keeping their distance. The only ones left were the bold, predatory types-harassing her,ridiculing her for pretending to be pure while selling herself on the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, Gabriela had lived in Phyllis&#39;s toxicshadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, with a coveted job at a top company.Gabriela finally had enough confidence to fight back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She deliberately pulled out her phone-having recorded the entire exchange-and shoved it under Phyllis&#39;s nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t want Dustin finding out what a venomous snake you really are, I suggest you back off and stop messing with me.&#34;</p>
