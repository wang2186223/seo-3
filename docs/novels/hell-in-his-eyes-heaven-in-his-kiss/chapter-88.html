                <p>Chapter88 Maybe She Truly Had Fallen For Him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta studied Wesley&#39;s impassive face,uncertainty curling in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he like the scarf Gabriela had knitted?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here, have this scarf,&#34; she urged, pressing it towvard him. &#34;Later, put it on and walk past Gabriela.Let her see it. Make her believe you&#39;re fond of it. Don&#39;t upset her,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley inclined his head, answering flatly, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he really expected to wear it immediately,parading it just to prove something to Gabriela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she cared for him deeply, why had she acted like a stranger before? She had even nitpicked his long legs, as if that small complaint could disguise her true feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a sly woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant Loretta came out of the study, Miriam,who&#39;d been lingering nearby, quickly approached.&#34;Well? How did it go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He accepted it, but he didn&#39;t look the least bit excited,&#34; Loretta muttered with a crease in her brow.&#34;Honestly, what&#39;s wrong with him? Gabriela gives him something so meaningful, and he can&#39;t even bother to smile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every word that left her lips, her irritation only deepened. &#34;Such a ridiculously good-looking man,yet he still can&#39;t find himself a girlfriend!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam leaned close, her voice soft and steady.&#34;Don&#39;t let it get under your skin. Let&#39;s test Gabriela&#39;s feelings first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Gabriela truly harbored feelings for Wesley, then whether his heart stirred or not didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their carefully crafted plan would have to unfold tonight.  With their minds set, Loretta and Miriam headed off to find Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that very moment, Gabriela was chatting on the phone with Farley. &#34;I&#39;ll come to see you in a few days.And don&#39;t forget-I need another taste of those pork chops of yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp knock sounded at the door. Gabriela hurried to end the call and rose to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta and Miriam slipped into the room, quietly shutting the door behind them. They scanned the hallway to ensure no one lurked nearby. Their secretive expressions sent a prickle of unease down Gabriela&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; she queried, her voice tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta caught Gabriela&#39;s hand, her face clouded with distress. &#34;Do you remember what I told you about Wesley-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela cut her short, her tone cool and measured,&#34;Don&#39;t circle around it. Just say what you mean.&#34; When it came to Wesley&#39;s tangled affairs, she wanted no part of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that she had money in her own account, all she wanted was to savor a life free of messy entanglements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a result, she needed to steer clear of the wealthy family&#39;s drama altogether.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just be honest with me.&#34; Loretta pressed with quiet insistence. &#34;Has Wesley truly treated you well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; Gabriela responded right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might treat her with cool detachment at times,teasing her for being clumsy, yet whenever she was cornered and defenseless, he unfailingly stepped in-her silent shield, her unshakable anchor. With him at her back, she found the strength to push against anyone who tried to wound her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A boss of his kind had truly been one of a kind in the whole world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta drew closer, her tone probing. &#34;And what about Miriam and me? Are we good to you as well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course you are!&#34; Gabriela said with a gentle smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;d like to ask a favor. Would you be willing to help me with something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her first instinct was to nod, buut Loretta&#39;s grave expression pulled her up short. Gabriela narrowed her eyes slightly. &#34;What kind of favor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The scarf you gave me earlier-Wesley seemed to take a liking to it, so l passed it on to him. Could you say you knitted it especially/for him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela blinked in confusion. &#34;Why would I do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her face aside, Loretta squeezed out a few tears. &#34;You know Wesley&#39;s past thirty now, and he still hasn&#39;t brought home a girlfriend. The rumors outside are vicious. People whisper that he isn&#39;t into women at all. Some even spouting the ridiculous claim that he&#39;s impotent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her, Miriam was all but flapping her lashes in  warning, her frantic winks looking like they might spasm out of control. Loretta was definitely overdoing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning in doubt, Gabriela noted, &#34;Mr. Moss is young, accomplished, and widely respected. Even if he hasn&#39;t settled down, who would dare spread such nonsense about him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loreta sighed. &#34;He lost his parents when he was just a boy. I poured my whole heart into raising him,always hoping one day he&#39;d build a family of his own.Now, all I ask is that he at least have a girlfriend before my time runs out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela kept her lips pressed together. She understood Loretta&#39;s concern, but how on earth did that relate to her giving Wesley a scarf?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta leaned in, her eyes sharp with intent. &#34;If Wesley took your scarf, it shows he feels something for you. Why not step into the role of his gilfriend just to silence the rumors?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suggestion jolted Gabriela. &#34;No. That&#39;s impossible.&#34; Her heart thudded at the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Brenden living under the same roof, pretending to be Wesley&#39;s girlfriend would only spark chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam blinked, caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night Wesley had brought Gabriela home, she&#39;d seen the girl&#39;s cheeks flush pink at his presence.That wasn&#39;t nothing. Gabriela had definitely been interested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that Wesley&#39;s disinterest in women had extinguished Gabriela&#39;s spark?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh no, that only proved it was time to push their final plan forward-without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam chimed in, &#34;How about this? When people are around, Loretta drops a hint that you&#39;re Wesley&#39;s future wife. You don&#39;t need to confirm it-just don&#39;t deny it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela immediately recoiled from the idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Brenden caught wind of this, he might run straight sley and tell him about their one-night stand,ying her as some conniving woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ela didn&#39;t want to lose her job, and couldn&#39;t ch the thought of Wesley seeing her as a ating opportunist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>only been a reckless, drunken night-nothing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>a, though, refused to let up. With tears ing in her eyes, she pleaded, &#34;I&#39;m already old,t I still have to endure others gossiping about he made a fuss, she could always find a way to things later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>nner, Gabriela caught sight of Wesley ding the stairs and went rigid where she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>g black coat swayed around him, a white scarf neatly against his throat, lending him an ss air of elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>so devastatingly handsome!  Maybe she truly had fallen for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she knew he could never return those feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization pinched like a bolade behind her ribs,leaving her chest aching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quiet sigh, Gabriela turned her face aside,swallowing her sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s brow tightened in irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had gone so far as to change into an outfit chosen to match that scarf, and yet Gabriela refused to spare him even a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she turned her back on him.Outrageous!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden, never one to keep quiet, broke the silence with a teasing tone. &#34;What&#39;s with the fancy getup at this hour, Wesley? And a scarf, too? I&#39;ve never seen you wear one before. Where&#39;d you even get it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley didn&#39;t bother acknowledging him, keeping his gaze fixed straight ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta had already grown weary of Brenden&#39;s  chatter and decided she&#39;d drag him out for another round of exercise after dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could continue, Miriam cut in brightly,&#34;This scarf looks perfect on you, Mr. Moss. Whoever made it clearly has some skill with their hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley flicked Gabriela a sidelong glance, his voice flat and unreadable. &#34;Not bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words pierced Gabriela harder than she expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had spent two full days knitting the thing, and all she got in return was &#34;not bad&#34;?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta had said he liked it-so why didn&#39;t it sound like it at all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam leaned forward, unwilling to let it go.&#34;Wait,isn&#39;t that the scarf Gabriela knitted? How did it end up with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley gave a slight nod. &#34;She kepot insisting,leaving me no choice but to accept.&#34;</p>
