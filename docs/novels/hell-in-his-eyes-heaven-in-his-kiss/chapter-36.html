                <p>While Wesley&#39;s irritation mounted, Gabriela remained wrapped in her perfect, unknowing bliss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After work, she dashed to the dry cleaners, clutching her coffee-splattered dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment the clerk quoted her $120, she balked andsnatched it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d just landed in the executive office-no telling how long she&#39;d survive-and her first paycheck was nowhere in sight. Now was not the time to splurge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She trudged home, dress in hand, only to spot Phyllis shivering on the front steps, stubbornly braving the cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela feigned ignorance, angling to slip past unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Phyllis, sharp-eyed as ever, instantly clocked the brand of Gabriela&#39;s dress and sidestepped to block her. &#34;Home early for once, aren&#39;t you, Gabriela?&#34; Phyllis drawled, voice thick with implication.&#34;Did your boyfriend buy you that dress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, focused on getting the stain out, shot back with a clipped, &#34;What&#39;s it to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s lips curved into a mock-sympathetic smile. &#34;Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you. The more those rich men spend, the more they expect from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela glanced over her shoulder, a sly grin breaking through. &#34;Are you actually worried about me, or just green with envy? Either way, you&#39;restill stuck on the outside looking in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During her school days, Gabriela had been too busy hustling for tuition to bother with high-end labels.She hadn&#39;t realized how expensive the dress was-then Phyllis&#39;s razor-sharp tone said it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After putting Phyllis in her place, Gabriela hurried off to scrub her dress clean, leaving Phyllis standing in the freezing air, burning with envy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis seethed, unable to comprehend how Gabriela, once the timid girl she&#39;d bossed around in school,had suddenly grown a spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she dwelled on it, the more it unsettled her. She racked her brain, but couldn&#39;t figure out what had changed. All she knew was she couldn&#39;t let it go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her wedding to Dustin less than three weeks away Phyllis was supposed to be basking in bridal bliss,but instead, she tossed and turned each night, furious at the sight of Gabriela parading around in luxury labels that even she couldn&#39;t afford. It gnawed at her, that Gabriela-of all people--dared to flaunt such things right under her nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t possibly wait for the wedding to put Gabriela in her place. The thought of humiliating Gabriela was the only thing that would let her rest easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis mulled over her next move, then pulled out her phone and dialed Rhys without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela had ditched her blind date with Rhys, and though he still felt slighted, he kept his tone courteous when Phyllis reached out-after all, she was a Haynes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Fox, I truly apologize for how things went with Gabriela last time,&#34; she said, her voice syrupy with forced warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reverent tone made Rhys feel unexpectedly important. He replied with cloyingeagerness, &#34;How can l help you today,Phyllis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His forced cordiality made Phyllis want to gag, but she kept her friendly mask firmlyin place. &#34;You know,Gabriela and I are about the same age, but she always finds ways to make the family worry.I was-hoping you might help me talk some sense into her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laid out her plan, then lavished him with praise for his education and fine character, leaving him grinning with pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys relished his sense of superiority. &#34;If she&#39;d been half as sensible as you, she wouldn&#39;t have bailed on our blind date.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis let out a delicate sigh. &#34;Gabriela&#39;s just obsessed with money, but real work? She wants nothing to do with it. She&#39;s always on the lookout for shortcuts-that&#39;s how she lost her way. But honestly, she isn&#39;t a bad person deep down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis continued, &#34;Right now, she&#39;s only with that old, unattractive guy because he showers her with expensive gifts. If you&#39;d just talk to her, maybe spend a little time together, I&#39;m sure she&#39;d start to realize how capable you are. She might even find her way back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After mocking Gabriela, Phyllis kept piling on the flattery to Rhys, insisting he was the only genuinely exceptional man she&#39;d ever met. With a helpless smile, she confessed that he was her last hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he could help steer Gabriela back on track, she&#39;d owe him a debt she&#39;d never forget-one she&#39;d be grateful for the rest of her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. Since you insist, I&#39;ll play along.&#34; Rhys tossed out a scornful laugh. &#34;But let&#39;s get something straight-she&#39;s absolutely not my type. I don&#39;t waste my time on that kind of trash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis thanked him in a rush, her relief barely concealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His biting contempt was exactly what she needed. All she wanted was a pompous loudmouth to stir up trouble for Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys fit the bill perfectly: arrogant, seIf-satisfied, and shamelessly theatrical. He&#39;d make sure every juicy detail of Gabriela&#39;s life was dragged out into the open, then shrug it off like he was doing her a favor-claiming he&#39;d still &#34;help&#34; her, even as her reputation crumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under such circumstances, how could Gabriela possibly keep her footing at the company? Would Wesley still hold her in such high regard?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Gabriela spent nearly an hour scrubbing the coffee stain from the dress, then threw her own outfit into the wash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By morning, everything was spotless. She carefully folded the clothes, stuffed them in a bag, and headed for the office, hoping to slip in quietly and return them to Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment she walked through the doors, she could feel dozens of eyes tracking her every move.When she reached the executive office, she finally spotted the source of all the attention-a stunning arrangement of red roses overflowing on the reception desk. The receptionist beckoned her over with a mischievous grin. &#34;Well, look at you, Gabriela. Flowers before you&#39;ve even clocked in? Someone&#39;s clearly got it bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela eyed the enormous bouquet, her confusion mounting as she struggled to make sense of the scene.Before she could gather her thoughts, Wesley strode into the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was filled with a chorus of respectful &#34;Good morning, Mr.Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela echoed the greeting,her voice faint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s gaze paused on her, lingering over the roses for a tense, loaded three seconds. Without a word, he turned and vanished into his office, the heavy air in his wake making his irritation impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy hurried after him, then stopped and addressed Gabriela with quiet urgency. &#34;Gabriela, could you come with me for a moment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching the extravagant bouquet, Gabriela trailed after him, her nerves tight, completely at a loss as to what she&#39;d just walked into.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley lounged behind his imposing desk, exuding the air of a judge about to hand down a harsh verdict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s nerves fluttered-she had a sinking feeling that those showy red roses had put him in a foul mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can explain,&#34; she blurted, rushing the words out before she lost her nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley barely acknowledged her, his gaze fixed somewhere past her shoulder, a wall of indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting moment, Gabriela wondered if his sour mood really had anything to do with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated only a heartbeat before offering the neatly folded clothes, hoping to defuse whatever storm was brewing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley didn&#39;t spare the clothes a second look. Instead, his steely eyes zeroed in on the bouquet in her arms, lips curving with the ghost of a sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela flung the roses onto a side table. &#34;I have no idea who sent these..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice caught as she glimpsed the name scrawled on the card: Rhys Fox.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It buzzed somewhere in her memory, but she couldn&#39;t place it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s eyes darkened, his patience clearly fraying. &#34;My office doesn&#39;t accept returns. Especially not after you&#39;ve worn them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was sharper than usual today, his annoyance radiating across the room. Flustered, Gabriela turned to Billy, silently pleading for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Billy just twisted the knife. &#34;You might as well keep them. The amount will be taken out of your paycheck.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela ventured softly, &#34;Mr. Clarke, could you tell me how much these cost?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy tossed out a price that dwarfed Gabriela&#39;s monthly salary, leaving her reeling in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All at once, it clicked-Fiona wasn&#39;t simply another lovesick nuisance buzzing around Wesley. The two of them were in on it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona&#39;s mission was to rattle her nerves, sowing chaos with sharp words and petty sabotage, while Wesley,under the guise of helpfulness, tightened the screws with every new hardship he piled onto her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was her punishment for crossing Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela kept her fury buried deep, knowing she couldn&#39;t risk an outburst around him, but promised herself that if Fiona ever showed her face again, she&#39;d return the favor tenfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Fiona, still plagued by her stubborn cold, let out another harsh, unrefined sneeze.</p>
