                <p>Night closed in, painting the city in deep shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela sat hunched over her phone, the screen castinng a pale glow across her tense features. Brenden hadn&#39;t sent a single update about collecting her things,nor bothered to answer any of her frantic texts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold dread seeped into her bones. What exactly was he waiting for? Did he want to corner her just to sleep with her again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After last night&#39;s tangled, reckless affair, wasn&#39;t he satisfied?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She longed to walk away, but anxiety nagged at her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apex Group was influential, and she considered herself lucky to have been accepted as an intern.Angering Brenden, her boss, now would be as good as throwing her own future away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela sat alone, nerves raw, endlessly cycling through half-remembered fragments of the company&#39;s protocol in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried every trick she knew to steady herself,even willing her own heartbeat to slow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, reality won out. After all, her entire future at Apex Group hung by a thread Brenden held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worse yet,she was the one who had stumbled into his arms last night-drunk and reckless. Even if she wanted to report him, who would take her side?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the wall clock ticked past nine, Gabriela had sunk into numb resignation. At last, sharp footsteps echoed down the polished floor-leather soles striking the silence like a warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, what do we have here? Who&#39;s still hanging around at this hour?&#34; Brenden&#39;s breezy voice sliced through the lobby, cool and unhurried, making Gabriela stiffen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sprang to her feet, forcing composure into her voice. &#34;Mr. Saunders, you are finally here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arching an eyebrow, he queried, &#34;You were actually waiting for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if he didn&#39;t already know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela swallowed her irritation, searching for a civil response, but Brenden cut her off,his tone suddenly sharp,&#34;And what were you mumbling about just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d noticed Gabriela from day one, mostly because of her striking looks. Shealways appeared so sweet and delicate-every bit the gentle beauty-but in reality,she was icy and kept her distance, completely unfazed by his usual brand of charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why hadn&#39;t she just gone straight home after the retreat? What was she still hanging around the office for?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was reciting the company&#39;s protocol,&#34; Gabriela snapped, clenching her jaw before immediately wishing she could take it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Brenden typically treated his employees well but what if she&#39;d just managed to get on his bad side?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she scrambled for a way to fix things, a low laugh drifted in from the hallway. Gabriela turned and found herself face-to-face with Wesley, tall and impossibly composed, watching the whole scene unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He filled the hallway, his sculpted features casting sharp. shadows beneath the overhead lights-a living,breathing work of art. No amount of cocky smirking could dim that allure; a face like his was magnetic in any mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s pulse stuttered. Just standing there,Wesley somehow raised the bar for every man she&#39;d ever laid eyes on. Brenden let out a snort, clearly amused by how completely Gabriela was captivated by Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to give credit to his cousin Wesley for his unmatched charm. Even Gabriela-the company&#39;s most aloof beauty-couldn&#39;t keep it together around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp sound snapped Gabriela back to earth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was Wesley, the man who signed her paychecks -her forbidden obsession. And there she was,shamelessly gawking at him like a lovesick teenager.Did she have a death wish?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela forced herself to concentrate-getting her things from Brenden had to come first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snapped her attention back to Brenden.Saunders,about last night-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could get another word out, Wesley&#39;s voice sliced through the tension. &#34;Brenden, go get the car.”、</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley always had his own driver, but Brenden clearly knew better than to argue. He shot Wesley a stiff nod and slipped away without a single complaint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now Gabriela was stranded in the echoing lobby with Wesley,nerves thrumming so loud she could barely  breathe. What was she supposed to do now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s face was unreadable, but his cool stare made her wonder if he&#39;d picked up on something between her and Brenden</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Brenden pulled the car around just as his phone buzzed. When he saw it was his girlfriend calling,he shot Wesley a cheerful goodbye and sped off, eager for his own evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley paid Brenden no attention. He slid into the car,shutting the door with finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, Gabriela finally exhaled, relief flooding through her. Maybe now she could escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s presence was so intense, she barely dared to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could even move, Wesley&#39;s window slid down. His eyes, dark and appraising, landed on her &#34;How are you getting home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to sound casual, Gabriela replied, &#34;Oh,I&#39;ll just catch the bus, Mr. Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp frown creased Wesley&#39;s features. &#34;Get in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic sparked in her chest. The idea of letting the CEO drive her anywhere was unthinkable. She quickly shook her head, hands raised in protest. &#34;No, it&#39;s really  fine. I can take the bus, honestly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley fixed her with a look so unreadable it sent an involuntary shiver crawling up Gabriela&#39;s spine. She barely breathed as she eased open the car door,moving straight for the back seat-distance was safety, and right now, she needed every inch she could get.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could settle in, Wesley&#39;s voice cut through the quiet, cool and razor-sharp. &#34;Do I look like I run a taxi service or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his tone was polite enough on the surface, the bite underneath made her heart lurch. Flustered,Gabriela quickly abandoned the back seat and slipped into the front beside him, fastening her seatbelt with shaky hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept utterly silent the entire ride. Wesley&#39;s face stayed icy, his jaw clenched tight and his mouth set in a severe line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela clutched her bag so hard her knuckles turned pale; her fingers trembled uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After several interactions with Wesley today, Gabriela realized he was just plain difficult, his moods shifting like storm clouds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made up her mind right then: from now on, she&#39;d keep her distance. When they hit a red light, Wesley looked like he might say something, but after a moment&#39;s hesitation,he just stared straight ahead in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after she climbed out of the car, that look of cold disdain still lingered on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s chest tightened with frustration and a sting of injustice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t done anything wrong. She&#39;d never asked him for a ride, so why did he have to act so annoyed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the gloom was short-lived. Her irritation flared up -because just then, she spotted her ex,Dustin Owen,standing at the entrance.</p>
