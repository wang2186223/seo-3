                <p>Chapter82 Doubt</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela swallowed the last bite of fatty meat with difficulty, her mind still wrestling with Wesley&#39;s sudden shift in demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of melancholy washed over her, souring what should have been a pleasant meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley disappeared into his study immediately after dinner,burying himself in his reading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta and Miriam shooed Gabriela away from the cleanup duty, insisting she unwind or lose herself in her phone instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These two wonderful women genuinely treasured her presence, and their kindness stirred something deep within Gabriela&#39;s chest. In that moment, she realized that returning here annually to cook without payment wouldn&#39;t feel like such a burden after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley might be a heartless businessman, but she could set aside her frustrations with him for the warmth that Loretta and Miriam offeredI her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bitter cold kept Gabriela indoors that evening.She retreated to her room, where she settled in to scroll through her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her name continued trending across social media platforms, with countless netizens offering apologies while unleashing criticism on Phyllis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After scanning through the flood of comments,Gabriela switched to lifestyle content.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she watched, Brenden&#39;s unusual eating preferences suddenly surfaced in her memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity overwhelmed her restraint, and she opened WhatsApp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her conversation with &#34;NotASaunders&#34; remained frozen at their last exchange from several days prior -when she had confronted Brenden about his wedding behavior, only to receive his terse response.&#34;ldiot.&#34; Gabriela&#39;s mind drifted back to those first two months of her company internship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had worked in the sales department while Brenden commanded all four sales divisions as general manager, creating frequent opportunities for interaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her memories painted him as an incurable charmer-every beautiful woman became his target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His generosity toward his girlfriends flowed freely,and his words dripped like honey from his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never once had Brenden called any woman an &#34;idiot&#34;-this much remained crystal clear in her recollection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet their WhatsApp history revealed multiple instances of him hurling that exact insult her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person who actually favored that particular word around her was...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s pulse hammered against her ribcage. Her memory confirmed it-Wesley had indeed branded her an &#34;idiot&#34; on several occasions during face-to-face encounters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reread their entire chat thread, mentally superimposing Wesley&#39;s personality onto each message, her astonishment growing with every line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NotASaunders&#34; possessed a communication style that mirrored Wesley&#39;s with startling accuracy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another vital clue lurked in his username:&#34;NotASaunders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps the person behind these messages wasn&#39;t Brenden at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it possibly be...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant this thought crystallized, Gabriela shook her head with violent denial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Wesley possibly masquerade as Brenden?What purpose would such deception serve?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here was a man who generated millions in mere minutes-why would Wesley squander his precious time on WhatsApp messages with her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was definitely mistaken in her speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if &#34;NotASaunders&#34; wasn&#39;t Brenden, then w/ho could it be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her carefree exterior, Gabriela possessed a proactive core. Once suspicion took root, she demanded immediate confirmation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She headed downstairs in search of Brenden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had sprawled across the couch in complete relaxation, fingers dancing across his phone screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His casual posture created a jarring contrast with the somewhat distant &#34;NotASaunders&#34; persona from WhatsApp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the sight caught her off guard, the timing was perfect-no one else was nearby. Gabriela steeled her resolve and called out, &#34;Mr. Saunders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice triggered an immediate transformation as Brenden bolted upright, straightening his spine,smoothing his clothes, and running fingers through his disheveled hair, embarrassment coloring his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relaxation came naturally to him, and his cousin&#39;s couch possessed an almost supernatural comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The familiarity had made him completely forget that Gabriela was staying in the house and could descend the stairs at any moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wondered if his slovenly appearance had diminished her opinion of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After clearing his throat, Brenden asked with earnest attention, &#34;Gabriela, is there something you need from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, yes.&#34; Gabriela summoned her courage and pressed forward. &#34;When will you return what belongs to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion clouded Brenden&#39;s expression. &#34;I&#39;m not following you.&#34; &#34;I mean the item I left with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela couldn&#39;t bring herself to mention their one-night stand. Besides, she wasn&#39;t even sure whether Brenden was the man who had slept with her. Explicit details were absolutely out of the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something you left with me?&#34; Brenden&#39;s bewilderment deepened. &#34;I have no recollection of you leaving anything in my possession.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s breath caught in her throat as her mind began spinning wildly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NotASaunders&#34; truly wasn&#39;t Brenden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To confirm this, she posed another question.&#34;Mr.Saunders, please stop this charade. You explicitly promised that if I prepared something delicious for you,you would return what&#39;s mine.So much time has passed-please don&#39;t delay any further.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sympathy pierced Brenden&#39;s heart as he observed Gabriela&#39;s pallor and the careful hesitation in her voice. Harshness toward beautiful women simply wasn&#39;t in his nature, especially when Gabriela ranked as the most stunning woman he had ever encountered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He searched his memory desperately, trying to recall what precious item of hers might have fallen into his possession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, her obvious crush on him flashed through his mind, and he wondered with growing incredulity if the thing she had left with him was... her heart!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela even thought that by cooking for him, he might develop feelings for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this the real reason she had chosen to sacrifice her holiday and work as a chef here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A complex mix of flattery and unease stirred within Brenden&#39;s chest. While his natural charm drew admirers, the notion that Gabriela harbored such profound feelings-enough to surrender her heart entirely-felt staggering in its intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had sparked such overwhelming devotion within her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange tension crossed Brenden&#39;s face-just enough to make Gabriela second-guess herself.She ventured forward with delicate uncertainty, &#34;Mr.Saunders?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley emerged at that precise moment,water glass in hand, and the scene before him brought his steps to an abrupt halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden gazed down at Gabriela with unmistakable smugness painted across his features, while she waited for his words with an almost childlike vulnerability etched into her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold snort escaped Wesley&#39;s lips as he swept his gaze over Gabriela with withering brevity, then strode past without acknowledging their existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That fleeting look Wesley had cast her way-though subtle and seemingly emotionless-carried the weight of crushing judgment. Her mind raced with questions about how much of their conversation he had witnessed and whether his sharp intellect had already pieced together the fragments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxiety bloomed like poison in her veins, making her desperate to flee to the sanctuary of her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brenden&#39;s voice suddenly cut through her spiraling thoughts. &#34;Gabriela, forgive me. I cannot provide what you&#39;re seeking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization of her deep-seated affection sent a brief surge of euphoria through Brenden&#39;s system,but reality quickly doused that flame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every woman who had graced his life-from minor celebrities to runway models-had been drawn like moths to the golden glow of his wealth, their affections as artificial as stage makeup. He understood this transaction perfectly and had never minded, since his own heart remained equally shallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela represented something entirely different-a rare gem of authenticity in his world of calculated relationships.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As someone who fled from commitment like it was a contagious disease, he couldn&#39;t offer her the fairy-tale ending she deserved, nor could he bear to string her along with false promises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this resolution crystallizing in his mind, Brenden delivered his verdict with unwavering finality.&#34;Moving forward, we should sever all contact between us. Should our paths cross again, we must behave as complete strangers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pivoted on his heel and departed without a backward glance, his footsteps echoing with decisive determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stood frozen in bewilderment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell did Brenden mean by that?</p>
