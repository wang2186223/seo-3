                <p>Wesley&#39;s smile faded as he caught the puzzled look on Gabriela&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never mind. It&#39;s nothing important,&#34; he said, his tone losing some of its warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle heaviness seemed to settle over him.Gabriela sensed the shift in his mood but, not knowing him well, decided not to press further. &#34;You should eat, Mr. Moss, before it gets cold,&#34; she urged,her voice gentle but cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Wesley looked lost in thought,but then something shifted behind his eyes. The earlier chill in his expression softened. He picked up his fork and started eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela,who&#39;d been anxiously waiting for his reaction,found herself entranced by the elegance of his movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here was the man she usually admired from a distance,now seated directly across from her, quietly enjoying her meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His subtle satisfaction was unmistakable. For once, Gabriela didn&#39;t feel like a mere employee grinding through overtime. The dynamic between them felt different-more intimate,somehow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that quiet moment, Wesley seemed less like her untouchable boss and more like a familiar friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s enchantment lasted all of five heartbeats before common sense jolted her back to earth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew better-Wesley might have c npped the arrogance tonight, but every inch of hin still broadcast untouchable wealth. Even the watch on his wrist was a level of luxury she&#39;d never reach, not in three decades of honest work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching a man like him-an undisputed tycoon-perched in a tiny café on a drafty night, savoring her homemade pasta, felt so absurdly out of place that it sparked a wave of reckless, foolish fantasies she tried to smother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate to regain her composure, Gabriela mentally chanted passages from the employee handbook, word for word, determined to keep her guard up the next time she faced Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Fiona sat stiffly in the passenger seat of Billy&#39;s car, her mood soured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Moss family had three eligible heirs all circling the prize,and no one knew who would eventually land the throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truth be told, if Wesley weren&#39;t the most captivating of the lot, Fiona never would&#39;ve endured his indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, every time she pictured his striking features, she found herself unable to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haunted by the memory of Wesley&#39;s perpetual indifference-how his rare warmth was saved for that mysterious person who dared insult him-Fior found herself prying for answers from Billy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sidled up beside Billy and asked, &#34;Billy, is Wesley always drowning in work? Has he ever actually dated anyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy managed a bland, practiced smile. &#34;I&#39;m afraid I wouldn&#39;t know, Miss Dewitt. As just an assistant, I&#39;d never meddle in Mr. Moss&#39; personal life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona refused to be shut down. She leaned in, her voice coaxing. &#34;Then what about his tastes? Does Wesley have any favorites? Any hobbies?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy remained impenetrable, his tone unwaveringly polite. &#34;My interactions with Mr. Moss are always purely professional. I couldn&#39;t say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Billy avoid any mention of Wesley&#39;s personal affairs only stoked the fire of Fiona&#39;s  frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She silently vowed that if she ever did become Mrs.Moss, her first act would be to fire Billy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever Fiona thought about Wesley&#39;s commanding elegance, she resisted backing down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The urge to win him over gnawed at her, spurring her on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Softening her voice, she probed, &#34;Billy, I spent the whole night with Wesley and picked up on some thing odd. Does he... actually enjoy being insulted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy&#39;s grip on the wheel tightened for a split second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh no! Could she have stumbled onto Wesley&#39;s biggest secret? How had things slipped so badly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he smoothed his features in record time,answering with a light chuckle, &#34;Of course not, Miss Dewitt. You&#39;re imaging things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy&#39;s denial didn&#39;t fool Fiona for a second-she caught the flicker of discomfort in his eyes and felt more convinced than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when she&#39;d been overseas, Fiona had breezed through a few psychology books, so she knew full well that some people harbored unusual preferences -there were even those who got a thrill from being  scorned or humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such a revelation about Wesley comnpletely stunned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She simply couldn&#39;t picture the immaculate,dignified Wesley possessing any sort of strange desire, let alone something so peculiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet throughout the evening, Wesley hadn&#39;t said a single word to her. Instead, he sat absorbed in his phone, lips curled in a rare, gentle smile,even as the messages he read were downright rude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona&#39;s chest tightened with envy. She longed to be the one who could make Wesley smile like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at her apartment, Fiona replayed the memory of Wesley&#39;s soft smile until it slipped into longing.Unable to hold back, she pulled out her phone and typed,&#34;Wesley, I made it home safe. Thanks for asking Billy to drive me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waited for his reply, but the screen stayed dark.After her shower, she tried again, her damp hair leaving a faint chill on her shoulders as she sent. &#34;I&#39;m heading to bed now. You should rest too, Wesley.Goodnight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s phone buzzed twice on the coffee table beside him,each message lighting up the screen in the quiet room. Gabriela, seated nearby, happened to glance at the glowing notifications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The brief glimpse told her enough-both messages from a girl. She quickly looked away, suppressing a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since spending more time with Aubrey, Gabriela&#39;s own curiosity about office gossip had grown. She pictured some sweet, earnest girl out there nursing a crush on the famously cold Wesley, bravely texting him goodnight while he left her on read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley cut the moment short, pushing his chair bork.&#34;I&#39;m done. Let&#39;s head out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Gabriela&#39;s eyes lingered on his phone made his mood nosedive and appetite disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rose from the table with a cool finality. &#34;I&#39;ll have someone drive you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, startled by his sudden chill, scrambled to gather her things. &#34;That&#39;s really not necessary.I can just grab a taxi-please, don&#39;t trouble yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Wesley wouldn&#39;t let it go. He quickly called for a car,walking Gabriela out to the curb himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he caught the flicker of uncertainty on her face,he drawled, &#34;What&#39;s wrong? You want to haggle with me for overtime?&#34; Gabriela shook her head so fast her hair nearly brushed his shoulder. &#34;No, of course not. I&#39;m just glad I could cook for you today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips pressed into a frown, and she instinctively swallowed any mention of overtime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rubbing the bridge of his nose, Wesley dropped the conversation. When the car pulled up, he opened the door and gestured for her to climb in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three uneventful days drifted by, and then the weekend rolled around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey was practically glowing as she checked her reflection in the office window for the fifth time before clocking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Gabriela asked what had her so excited, Aubrey beamed.Her boyfriend-who lived halfway across the country-was finally coming to town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey grinned and nudged Gabriela&#39;s arm. &#34;Hey, why don&#39;t you hang around tonight? My boyfriend and I can take you out for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela shook her head with a gentle laugh. &#34;You two deserve your time together. I&#39;d only be a third wheel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey grinned, tossing her hair with satisfaction.&#34;That&#39;s my girl.&#34; Watching Aubrey glow with anticipation, a pang of envy flickered through Gabriela&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled out her phone, hoping for a distraction,but her WhatsApp list looked painfully empty. No one to message,no one waiting for her reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thumb hovered mid-scroll as she realized-these days, her most frequent contact was Brenden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of their one-night stand made he-heart flutter despite herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to resist, she typed out a message.Saunders, are you free tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he was available, maybe she could bring him home tomorrow-just to shut down Phyllis&#39;s nonstop jabs and pay Josh a quick visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Wesley sat stiffly at Loretta&#39;s house,forced to sit through her never-ending chatter.</p>
