                <p>Only a few days remained before the New Year, and the streets were silent, almost abandoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy kept the car moving briskly, reaching the Midnight Oasis bar in just under thirty minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Its exterior leaned toward a gothic mood-murals of shadow-thick forests, inky vines, and watchful ravens stretched across the walls. By contrast,a patch of emerald-green plants formed a neat little garden near the entrance, a touch of life breaking the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mix of styles gave the place an odd yet memorable charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midday left the bar nearly empty, its quiet settling like a soft echo in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela cast Billy a knowing glance. &#34;That&#39;s quite a drive, Mr. Clarke. Just give me a little time, and I&#39;ll take you out for lunch,&#34; she promised lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy opened his mouth to decline, but Gabriela had already slipped out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had arranged everything beforehand with the bar&#39;s owner, and before she even crossed the threshold, a tall, broad-shouldered man strode out,his deep voice carrying easily. &#34;Gabriela! Finally,you&#39;re here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashing him a warm, easy smile, she replied, &#34;Hey,Tyler.Been a long time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyler Jordan owned the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years back, when Marie&#39;s gambling habit had spiraled out of control, she&#39;d racked up overthree hundred thousand in debt. Tyler&#39;s father had been among the creditors-holding an IOU from Marie for twenty thousand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Gabriela&#39;s mother&#39;s help, Marie could have wiped out all her debts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a day before she secured the funds, Tyler&#39;s father went to collect money from another debtor.The man, crushed under the pressure, jumped into the river, and the incident spiraled into tragedy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s death brought the police down on Tyler&#39;s father, who was sentenced to twenty years in prison -and he had yet to see freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike his father, Tyler refused to walk the same ruinous path. He worked hard, saved every penny,and eventually opened his own bar, determined to live clean. Back in Gabriela&#39;s high school days,she had worked as a bartender at Tyler&#39;s bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her striking looks and natural charm drew customers in without her even trying, turning the bar into a livelier spot whenever she was around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyler had always been the dependable sort-steadfast, straightforward, and protective. To him,Gabriela was just a poor girl trying to save up for tuition, and he quietly took it upon himself to look out for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over time, their easy conversations turned into Back when he first learned about her suffering, Tyler had reacted the same way-threatening to rally his friends to grind Phyllis&#39;s bones and win back Gabriela&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years had passed, but his hot-headed streak was as fierce as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela chuckled, shaking her head, &#34;No need for an army this time, Tyler. Just help me record a quick video.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Name it and it&#39;s done,&#34; he said without hesitation.&#34;What do you want me to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out her phone, Gabriela adjusted the camera and hit record.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the matter was wrapped up, Tyler insisted she stay for lunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got a friend waiting outside,&#34; Gabriela said with a quick smile. &#34;I&#39;ll bring him in to join us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She jogged out to the curb, waved Billy over, and ushered him inside before introducing him to Tyler. Tyler clasped Billy&#39;s hand in a firm shake. &#34;So, you&#39;re Gabriela&#39;s boss, huh? Quite the high achiever.&#34; His grin widened as he added, &#34;Gabriela is at a top university, and she&#39;ll graduate with a master&#39;s degree next year. She&#39;s every bit as impressive. You make sure you take good care of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy kept his reaction to himself, though inside he marveled that Gabriela had such a capable friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thought crossed his mind-was Wesley meant to hear about this,given his possessive streak?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, Tyler had filled the table with steaming,fragrant dishes and threw down a challenge for Billy to drink against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela leaned in, her voice light but resolute. &#34;Not happening. He&#39;s the one behind the wheel later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Respecting the reminder, Tyler simply chuckled and poured himself a few cups instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the last plate was cleared, Billy found Tyler surprisingly likable,the kind of man he could trust. Tyler, feeling the same, treated Billy as though they&#39;d already shared years of friendship. &#34;Swing by whenever you&#39;ve got time, man. I know a guy like you might think we&#39;re a bit rough around the edges,butl stick by my friends. I&#39;ve got plenty of friends I can call on, and if you ever run into trouble, I&#39;ll back you up without a second thought. Gabriela&#39;s had a hard road-do me a favor and keep an eye out for her.I owe you one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they stepped out of the bar, Billy remarked with a hint of amusement, &#34;Your friend&#39;s got quite the passionate streak, Miss Haynes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s smile warmed. &#34;Tyler really is a wonderful person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy gave a slight jolt, as if her words had caught him off guard. Wesley could never know about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On their way back to the Moss Manor, the place was already buzzing with activity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Gabriela absent, lunch duties fell to Loretta and Miriam, who laid out braised ribs, steamed fish,stir- fried beef, and a few simple side dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They avoided onions and celery, which Wesley couldn&#39;t stand, and left out any trace of chili.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet for all its effort, the spread lacked the warmth of Gabriela&#39;s cooking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta had been feeding Wesley for more than ten years, but today every bite tasted flat, as if the flavor had been drained away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He toyed with hisfork but barely ate a bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden leaned over with a mischievous grin.&#34;How come Gabriela&#39;s not in the kitchen today? I&#39;ve been dreaming about those BBQ ribs she makes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold shadow crossed Wesley&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta cut Brenden a sharp look before setting down a plate of fish. &#34;What, you think she works here just to feed you? Eat your fish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s hefty daily rate was meant to coax Wesley into opening his heart-not to give Brenden someone boss around in the dining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden sat frozen in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No mouthwatering dishes from Gabriela today-and now this dreadful, overcooked fish? The day was ruined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Gabriela had no idea Wesley was quietly pining for her cooking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was absorbed in messaging Aubrey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Wesley had already wiped every trace of the scandal from trending topics, the netizens hadn&#39;t forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Comments still seethed with anger, accusing Gabriela of throwing her weight around and lashing back because she had something to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the trending topics about her had disappeared, public anger still simmered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relentless critics drifted to other popular platforms,publishing long tirades that dragged Gabriela into even larger conversations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the scandal reached people who neither followed celebrity gossip nor touched Instagram.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some influential figures insisted Gabriela had no moral compass and was nothing but an ingrate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their words ignited another wave of outrage,with uninformed netizens piling on and hurling ugly insults her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the end of the day, Gabriela&#39;s name was dirt,her reputation beyond repair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey fumed behind her phone, locked in an endless online brawl, trading blow after blow with strangers in Gabriela&#39;s defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sent Gabriela a furious message. &#34;Have Mr.Moss handle these fools and get their accounts wiped out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her eyes, these nobodies had no right to hurl such vile insults at Gabriela. Gabriela offered an assurance. &#34;I&#39;ve alreadythought of a way to handle it. Just breathe, Aubrey. Don&#39;t lower yourself to their level.&#34;</p>
