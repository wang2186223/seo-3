                <p>Billy burst intoWesley&#39;s study without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley, seated at his sleek black desk, was already two-thirds deep into a book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound of the door, he closed it with a precise snap and set it aside, attention now fully on his assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy wasted no time, launching into a detailed report.&#34;Mr. Moss, all traces of the incident online are gone.When Miss Haynes wakes, she won&#39;t suspect a thing.Claire&#39;s luxury deals are canceled. SK Elite Boutique has sworn never to work with her again, and she&#39;s been axed from the most popular drama this year.She won&#39;t recover from this anytime soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley lifted his gaze, nodded once, and said, &#34;Well done. Keep an eye on things over the next few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy straightened, shoulders back, pride practically radiating off him. &#34;Mr.Moss, you don&#39;t have to worry.Miss Haynes won&#39;t face a single problem while I&#39;m on watch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Billy, this was nothing more than doing what was expected of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, cruising around in Wesley&#39;s sleek black Porsche had earned him envious stares at every turn.Even Erik from the Williams Group had come by,gawking at the car and muttering under his breath about how stingy his own boss was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy couldn&#39;t hide the smug grin creeping onto his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, beneath his pride, he felt a sliver of guilt toward Gabriela. The car that Wesley had given him wasn&#39;t a gift; it was payment for keeping the truth from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And thinking of Gabriela in trouble made him resolve,silently but firmly, to go all out for her,whether Wesley asked or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As their discussion wound through business matters, Wesley&#39;s eyes flicked toward the door,a faint,almost imperceptible smile tugging at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms.Haynes,please come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela had been standing in the doorway,eavesdropping on their conversation. In that moment, she realized that Wesley truly was looking out for her. He had even instructed Billy to personally oversee the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From childhood until now, no one had ever stood by her so unwaveringly, silently shielding her from everything that could hurt her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Wesley were interested in women, Gabriela knew without a doubt that she would want to marry him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt a surge of warmth, and then, startled by his voice, she slowly stepped into the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley leaned back in his chair, a faint, unreadable smile tugging at the corner of his lips as his fingers tapped a quiet rhythm on the desk. &#34;So, how much did you catch?&#34; &#34;Maybe... a third,&#34; Gabriela replied, her voice steady.&#34;Mr. Moss, I didn&#39;t mean to eavesdrop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The study was soundproofed well enough that she&#39;d only picked up fragments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s gaze lingered on her thoughtfully,suddenly realizing that she was already aware of the online storm swirling around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you scared?&#34; he asked, voice calm but probing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all,&#34; Gabriela said instantly, her eyes meeting his. &#34;With you backing me, Mr. Moss, what could there possibly be to fear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s smile widened imperceptibly. HHer rare confidence, so bold, so unapologetic, was unexpectedly charming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her advantage, determination threading through her tone. &#34;I&#39;d like to take half a day off today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After waiting so long, she finally had her opening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Wesley in her corner, she could act decisively and hit Phyllis where it would hurt most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, she would meet two very important people-individuals who held the keys to her vengeance against Phyllis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Approved.&#34; Wesley didn&#39;t ask any more questions.&#34;Where are you headed? Let my driver take you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela inclined her head politely. &#34;Thank you, Mr.Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy couldn&#39;t resist chiming in. &#34;I drove here.I can give you a ride, Miss Haynes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela blinked, a little caught off guard by Billy&#39;s unexpected kindness. He was such a nice soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy, for his part, was equally surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While everyone else was already on vacation,Gabriela still had to request a leave of absence from Wesley to leave his house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that Wesley already considered her his private property? He&#39;d always seemed refined and restrained, yet who would have guessed he could be so possessive and so quietly intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy&#39;s sympathy for Gabriela deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley simply nodded. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He already had a sense of her plan. And with Billy&#39;s combat expertise, she&#39;d be safe under his watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy and Gabriela stepped out of the study together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela exchanged a few quick words with Miriam and Loretta before slipping into Billy&#39;s sleek black Porsche and leaving the manor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the scenery blurred past the window, a surge of emotions swelled within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sixteen years had passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she really reclaim what her mother had left behind this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she failed, who knew how many more years she&#39;d have to wait. Noticing her downcast gaze, Billy offered a gentle reassurance. &#34;Don&#39;t let it get to you. People online don&#39;t know the truth, so they hurl those cruel words at you.Mr. Moss has already wiped all related topics.Soon,no one will even remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Mr. Clarke,&#34; Gabriela replied with a small smile. &#34;I&#39;m not upset... actualy, I&#39;m quite happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plan had always been long-term: spend years building workplace connections, saving money,and gradually turning the tables on Marie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never imagined Phyllis would hand her such a golden opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Wesley supporting her, she felt she already had the strongest ally she could ask for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following Gabriela&#39;s directions, Billy drove nearly halfway across Okburg. Two hours later, they arrived at their destination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Haynes, is this the place? Would you like me to accompany you inside?&#34; Billy offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, thank you, Mr. Clarke. I can manage on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had reached one of Okburg&#39;s old districts.The alley ahead was too narrow for a car, so Gabriela stepped out and continued on foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped before a weathered wooden door and knocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, it creaked open, revealing an older man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t yet sixty, but gray streaked through his temples, and his eyes carried the weight of years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s eyes glimmered with unshed tears. Softly,she whispered, &#34;Farley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Haynes?&#34; Farley Moreno&#39;s face lit up in recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had once served as right-hand man to Alanna Haynes, Gabriela&#39;s late mother. Though she&#39;d insisted countless times that he use her first name, he never wavered. He addressed her formally as &#34;Miss Haynes,&#34; a mark of both respect and enduring loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, come in and have a seat, Miss Haynes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time Farley had seen her was before her college entrance exams. Her arm had been scalded by Phyllis with boiling water, and she&#39;d battled a high fever for days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela had asked Farley to take photos as evidence of the incident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, she had secretly left half of her hard-earned savings with him, promising to return only when the time came to reclaim her mother&#39;s belongings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Six years had passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela sat down and briefly outlined her plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley&#39;s eyes lit up. &#34;Miss Haynes, you&#39;re finally taking action?&#34; Gabriela nodded solemnly, a trace of concern in her voice. &#34;Farley, I&#39;m sorry, but after this, there&#39;s no going back. Life&#39;s going to get more complicated from here onwards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; he said firmly, unwavering. &#34;I&#39;ve waited for this day every single day. As long as I can help you make things right, I&#39;ll do whatever it takes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela chuckled softly. &#34;For now, I just need you to bring out my mother&#39;s will. I will let everyone see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away, Miss Haynes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Farley rose immediately and went to unlock the safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela spent the next hour at Farley&#39;s side,carefully sorting through documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she prepared to leave, she paused-her eyes tracing the dilapidated house, then dropping to Farley&#39;s crippled foot. Her voice softened. &#34;Farley,once the house is mine, would you like to move in and live with me?&#34; Farley shook his head firmly, a small,knowing smile tugging at his lips. &#34;I&#39;ve lived here for years. This place is my home now. I don&#39;t want to go anywhere else. But you have my word, I&#39;ll always be here,and if you ever need me, I&#39;ll be ready,no questions asked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela nodded, understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some things couldn&#39;t be rushed. She would revisit the idea once the house was truly hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After bidding farewell to Farley, she went back to Billy. &#34;Sorry to keep you waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing,&#34; he replied quickly. &#34;Where to next,Miss Haynes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s lips curved into a wistful smile,eyes glimmering with a touch of nostalgia. &#34;To a bar called Midnight Oasis.&#34;</p>
