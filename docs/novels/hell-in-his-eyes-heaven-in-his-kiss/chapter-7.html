                <p>The blind date was slated for the cozy corner of Vanilla Waves Café.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stepped inside and lingered by the entrance for a few minutes before her date finally appeared.He wore a sharply tailored suit that only emphasized his middle-aged gut, but not even expensive clothes could disguise the bland, lackluster aura he carried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips curled into a smug grin. &#34;Apologies for the delay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela offered a polite smile, her tone even. &#34;No trouble at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man raked his gaze over her, lingering just a beat too long before saying, &#34;Rhys Fox. I assume Phyllis has already filled you in. She told me you&#39;re...a bit materialistic.&#34; He gave a thin, pointed smile, then added coolly, &#34;Just so you know-I don&#39;t hand over my paychecks for anyone else to control. You&#39;ll quit your job once we&#39;re married and focus on running the household.I expect you to take care of my parents as well. In exchange, I&#39;ll give you an eight-thousand monthly allowance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys, who was in his early thirties, already sported a receding hairline and an air of smug superiority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela had never cared much about looks, but his arrogance made her skin crawl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly,she had anticipated this. Phyllis had set her up with this man out of spite, not concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Josh&#39;s earlier phone call-his anxious reminder to give the blind date a real chance-echoed in her mind.Swallowing her pride, Gabriela forced herself to stay civil, biting back every insult she wanted to unleash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys pressed on. &#34;Phyllis mentioned you lost your parents, and her family took you in. They&#39;ve done their part. Now that you&#39;re an adult, you should be independent and start living on your own. If you really can&#39;t find a place to stay, you could move in with me.We&#39;ll treat it as a test run-see if you can handle married life. But let&#39;s be clear: if I decide you&#39;re not suitable, I&#39;ll have you move out, no questions asked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s fingers itched to fling her coffee right in Rhys&#39;s face and snap him out of his delusions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced herself to remain calm instead of causing a scene. For Josh&#39;s sake, she had to swallow her frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes dragged by before she finally snapped.She excused herself to the restroom, pulled out her phone,and begged Aubrey for a rescue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Gabriela returned, Rhys&#39;s face soured. With an air of reluctance, he finally said, &#34;You&#39;re far from perfect, but at least you&#39;re easy on the eyes. My parents should be satisfied. After we get married, I&#39;ll make sure you learn how to behave. Are you at least decent at cooking? I expect my wife to handle those basics, you know...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys rambled on, barely pausing for breath. Gabriela stared at him, forcing a polite smile as her patience wore dangerously thin. Just then, her phone vibrated.Relief washed over her when she saw Aubrey&#39;s name flash on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered, voice pitched in theatrical annoyance.&#34;What? Overtime again? You&#39;re telling me the project&#39;s a disaster and needs revision right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The act was flawless. Hanging up, she flashed Rhys an apologetic look. &#34;Sorry, but I&#39;ve got a work emergency. I need to head back to the office right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys&#39;s brow furrowed, his irritation impossible to hide.&#34;You&#39;re really going to bail for work in the middle of our date?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela lifted her hands in mock surrender. &#34;I don&#39;t have a choice. My boss squeezes every drop out of us -nothing but ruthless capitalism these days.&#34; Rhys refused to be brushed off. His lips curled into a sneer. &#34;If you walk out now, don&#39;t expect to see me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sweet, wide-eyed look, Gabriela countered,&#34;Mr. Fox, this project is worth billions. If I nail it, I&#39;ll have enough for a mansion. If it tanks, I&#39;m out of a job.Are you offering to buy me a mansion if things go sideways?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sharp sarcasm cut straight through his ego Flushed with indignation, Rhys spun on his heel and stalked off, muttering under his breath, &#34;Phyllis had you sized up from the start. All you care about is money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela felt no irritation at all. She finished her coffee with a cheerful flourish, waiting until Rhys had completely disappeared before rising from her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she made her way toward the exit, a familiar figure caught her eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There,half-hidden in a shadowy corner, sat Wesley.Even seated, his sharp suit and commanding presence made him impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, she called out, &#34;Mr. Moss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley glanced up,returning her greeting with a curt nod and an unmistakably sour look. Gabriela&#39;s gaze flicked to the lovely woman seated across from him, then back to Wesley&#39;s unreadable face. The situation clicked in an instant. Leaning closer, she lowered her voice. &#34;Wait-are you here for a blind date too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but wonder why someone as formidable and accomplished as Wesley would choose such an unremarkable place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley offered a barely perceptible nod before rising from his seat. &#34;Heading back to the office?&#34; he asked,his tone unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela suspected he&#39;d caught her entire exchange from earlier. She mustered a respectful nod. &#34;Yes, Mr.Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s lips quirked in a faint smirk. &#34;Billy just called.I&#39;ll head back with you and sort it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s mind stalled for a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her supposed work emergency was nothing but a convenient excuse-was he playing along with her charade?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,if Wesley wasn&#39;t interested in this matchmaking setup,who could force his hand?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though a whirlwind of questions churned in her mind,  she kept her doubts to herself and trailed after Wesley in silence.</p>
