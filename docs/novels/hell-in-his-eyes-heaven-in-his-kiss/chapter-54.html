                <p>Gabriela&#39;s eyes sparkled with expectation as she looked at Wesley. &#34;Don&#39;t you think the bracelet&#39;s missing something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley stifled a smile, his eyes dancing with quiet amusement. &#34;Your hand is striking enough. Jewelry would only weigh it down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Really, what kind of taste was that? Beautiful hands deserved luxurious skincare or, at the very least, a stunning watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d missed such an obvious hint. No wonder he was wealthy but still unattached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s spirits sank, and she tugged her sleeve down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting gears, she recalled something else. &#34;Mr.Moss, that suit is an off-the-rack piece. Mr. Saunders should probably try it on first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley nodded.&#34;Noted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up the suit and stepped into the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he emerged, Gabriela found herself staring,captivated for a long moment before snapping back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait, wasn&#39;t this suit for Brenden? Was Wesley just trying on the suit to check the fit for Brenden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Wesley adjusted his sleeves, he glanced at her.&#34;Do you know how to tie a necktie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela nodded absently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She vaguely remembered tying a necktie for someone before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here and help me,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still dazed, Gabriela approached him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she drew near, a cool, commanding presence enveloped her, his masculine aura overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart pounded uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding the tie, she noticed the top button of Wesley&#39;s white shirt was undone. Softly, she said,&#34;Your shirt&#39;s unbuttoned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley looked down at her. &#34;Button it for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried a low, husky edge, laced with an almost magnetic pull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,Mr. Moss,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s fingers trembled with nerves, and when they grazed his firm chest, she pulled back, her ears flushing red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley let out a soft chuckle, his Adam&#39;s apple shifting, sending her heart into a deeper flutter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could you bend down a bit, Mr. Moss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Wesley leaning closer, Gabriela managed to button his shirt and tie the necktie.  His usual style was cold and precise, exuding a cold,distant air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suit she&#39;d chosen was classic, elegant, and refined. It might not have matched the price of his usual attire, but on him, it looked effortlessly stylish and striking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was entranced. &#34;You look incredibly sharp.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The understated outfit highlighted his prominent Adam&#39;s apple, drawing her in despite herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley was amused by her expression. &#34;The suit&#39;s impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela felt lightheaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s height and charm could make anything look like couture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when he changed out of the suit did Gabriela recall the pressing issue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Wesley was just trying it on, what was the point if it fit perfectly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>null  Caught up in his charisma, she briefly entertained a wild idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she should gift the suit to him. It probably wouldn&#39;t fit Brenden anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t dare say it aloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the day felt heavy for Gabriela as she wondered whether Wesley had delivered the suit to Brenden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After getting home and showering, she still hadn&#39;t heard from Brenden, so she texted him. &#34;Did you get the suit? Tried it on? Does it fit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NotASaunders&#34; replied quickly, &#34;It fits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was confused. Had she misremembered?Maybe Brenden wasn&#39;t that much shorter than Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, if he said it fit, there was nothing more to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The days passed swiftly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three days before the holiday, Wesley had Billy contact the think tank to arrange a trip to Athea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A critical project had hit a snag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Wesley&#39;s personal secretary, Gabriela packed his belongings-part of her routine duties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Athea&#39;s climate is humid and about ten degrees colder than here, Mr. Moss, so dress warmly. Watch your diet too. Celery&#39;s good for your heart. Try to eat some and don&#39;t be too picky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she folded his clothes and packed, she kept up her reminders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley leaned against the doorframe, watching her with a warm gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her forgetfulness, she cared enough to look out for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he weren&#39;t worried about raising her suspicions,he&#39;d have brought her to Athea. Having grown accustomed to her cooking, his tastes had grown even more selective. He looked at her, his voice low and captivating.&#34;Don&#39;t worry.I&#39;ll be back on time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching his steady gaze, Gabriela realized she was fussing like a concerned spouse, overstepping her role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She handed the two large suitcases to Billy. &#34;Mr.Clarke, you know about Mr. Moss&#39;s heart condition,right? If there&#39;s drinking, keep it under control. Even if the project hits bumps, don&#39;t let him stress too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Wesley&#39;s wealth, there was no need to risk his health over a project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy smiled and nodded. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll look after Mr.Moss for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela frowned, puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did Billy mean by &#34;for you&#34;? Wasn&#39;t it part of his job as Wesley&#39;s secretary to take care of him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she quickly brushed it off, following them to the parking garage to see them off. Soon,Wesley and Billy reached the airport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The think tank members exchanged amused looks at the sight of Wesley&#39;s oversized suitcases.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy laughed, explaining for Wesley. &#34;Miss Haynes packed these for Mr. Moss. Besides clothes, there are plenty of energy-boosting supplements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only a few days abroad. Surely Gabriela didn&#39;t need to go all out for something like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley cast a glance at the group and gave a helpless shrug. &#34;What can I say? She&#39;s always fussing over my health.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The think tank members were left speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounded suspiciously like Wesley was flaunting Gabriela&#39;s concern for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with Wesley and Billy away, under Tessa&#39;s direction, the team finished the last tasks before the The night before the holiday, Aubrey wheeled her suitcase over and said goodbye to Gabriela.&#34;Gabriela, you have to video chat with me at midnight on New Year&#39;s. Let&#39;s count down together!Ugh, I&#39;m already missing you and the holidays haven&#39;t even started.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela smirked.&#34;Spare me the theatrics.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, Aubrey would be with her boyfriend, and she probably wouldn&#39;t have time for a video call at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey huffed, &#34;God, you&#39;re frigid. No wonder someone as gorgeous as you is still single!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela saw her off at the train station, marking the start of her holiday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Phyllis&#39;s wedding approaching,the bride-to-be had grown uncharacteristically quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Gabriela knew her too well-silence usually meant Phyllis was plotting something. Something that, more often than not, involved setting a trap for Gabriela.</p>
