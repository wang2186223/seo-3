                <p>Brenden&#39;s head snapped toward Gabriela, his expression a mix of surprise and mild confusion.&#34;Gabriela? What are you even doing here? And since when am I your boyfriend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her carefully crafted plan to act as though they were strangers unraveled in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd erupted with sharper, mocking laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So she&#39;s not his girlfriend at all--just a backup option.How pitiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gabriela, what the hell happened to you? Where&#39;s your self-respect?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis lingered at the edge of the chaos, watching Gabriela stand alone under the jeers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, satisfied smile curved her lips-she relished every second of seeing Gabriela too humiliated to lift her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela couldn&#39;t care less about their snide remarks.She&#39;d already endured a tidal wave of malice back in high school and come out standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then she noticed Josh watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were rimmed red, glistening like he was on the verge of tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the one thing she could never face without flinching-Josh crying. With his fragile heart,she feared even the smallest upset might push him too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow burn of irritation welled up inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden had really outdone himself-choosing the exact wrong time to disappoint her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh stepped forward, gripping her arm with trembling fingers, his voice rough with hurt. &#34;Didn&#39;t you tell me you&#39;d found yourself a great boyfriend?How could he turn out to be some womanizing playboy? You declined to attend the blind date, saying you were already seeing someone. Was all of that just a lie? How could you fool me like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pointed questions from Josh only deepened the crowd&#39;s contempt, their eyes narrowing on Gabriela as if she were beneath them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden, still trying to process why a middle-aged man was breaking down in front of him, felt an odd twist of unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the moment it dawned on him-he might have made a mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the brittle curve of Gabriela&#39;s smile and the way her expression trembled with wounded pride, he guessed that dismissing her so publicly must have stung.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of guilt crossed his features. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,Gabriela. I really didn&#39;t realize you were...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t get as far as the last words-&#34;so taken with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the awkward pause could settle, Vivian&#39;s friend leaned in, her tone sharp with warning. &#34;Mr.Saunders, back in high school, Gabriela was a wild one-always running with the wrong crowd. You&#39;d better watch she doesn&#39;t cling to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Judging by Gabriela&#39;s usual behavior, Brenden knew that accusation was bullshit and cut in, his voice firm,&#34;She&#39;s not that kind of person...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cheerful buzz in the room abruptly died, every head swiveling toward the hotel entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the group encircling Gabriela broke off, their eyes drawn to the commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian craned her neck, curiosity piqued. &#34;Who&#39;s that? Why&#39;s everyone heading over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not sure. Looks like a VIP just showed up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of excitement lit Vivian&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recalled offhandedly telling her brother a few days ago that she wanted him at the wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he really had come, his business clout would have half theroom fawning over her for introductions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shoving her way through the guests, she hurried toward the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Gabriela&#39;sphone vibrated with a short,almost terse text. &#34;I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was none other than Wesley who sent the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked, momentarily thrown. What exactly did he mean by that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On instinct, she lifted her head toward the doors,trying to catch a glimpse, but the entrance was packed-a restless tide of bodies blocking her view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She began pushing forward, intent on confirming her suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could break through the crowd, Josh seized her arm. His eyes brimmed with tears, his voice shaking as he demanded, &#34;Don&#39;t you dare dodge me, Gabriela. Tell me the truth-do you not have a boyfriend at all? How could you lie to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down his face in an unending torrent,soaking his cheeks until they glistened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stood frozen, unsure how to comfort him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she could do was speak gently, her voice low and steady. &#34;Vivian and her friends have it out for me.They dragged Brenden here just to humiliate me.I swear I have a boyfriend-I&#39;m not making this up.Please, Uncle Josh, stop crying... people are staring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he seemed beyond caring, completely consumed by grief, his sobs shaking his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this rate, if she didn&#39;t present a boyfriend soon,she feared his tears might break her before they stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the hotel, Wesley finished tapping out a message just as Billy stepped forward to open the car door. He waited in silence, posture straight, while two rows of towering men in sharp black suits flanked the entrance, holding back the curious crowd pressing for a better look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air felt charged, almost oppressive, as if the entire lobby were holding its breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley stepped out of the car in a dark-gray classic suit that exuded quiet authority, instantly drawing every gaze his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marie marched right toward him, only to halt when a wall of stone-faced bodyguards blocked her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without slowing, Wesley strode into the hotel, his polished shoes clicking against the marble floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition rippled through the crowd. &#34;That&#39;s Mr.Moss from Apex Group,isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My God, what on earth is he doing here? The Haynes family actually got him to show up? I didn&#39;t know they had that kind of pull.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think it&#39;s Phyllis&#39;s doing, or maybe Dustin&#39;s connections?&#34; &#34;Come on-let&#39;s edge closer. Once those bodyguards ease up, it&#39;ll be the perfect time to greet Mr.Moss and make an impression.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Escorted by his black-suited entourage, Wesley cut a direct path to Gabriela. &#34;Sorry, I&#39;m late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he remarked, his voice a low, velvety rumble. His expression stayed coolly composed, yet his gaze on her was unmistakably warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh still clung to Gabriela&#39;s hand as she tried in vain to calm him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, out of nowhere, the impossibly polished Wesley stood before her in the very suit she had chosen for Brenden. She froze, breath catching in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the distant look in her eyes, Wesley&#39;s brows drew together as he queried, &#34;Why are you just standing there? Come here already!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock of seeing him here left her momentarily speechless. Whatever had brought him, gratitude swelled in her chest. His poised, unshakable presence was like a lifeline she hadn&#39;t known she needed until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drifted over, still looking a touch bewildered,and murmured, &#34;What brings you here, Mr. Moss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, his expression seemed to shadow instantly at the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela swallowed whatever she&#39;d been about to say and simply remained at his side, quiet and still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s tears had finally dried, leaving him staring at Wesley as if he couldn&#39;t quite believe his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was Gabriela&#39;s boss. Why would he attend this wedding when they hadn&#39;t sent him an invitation at all? Could it be possible that he was Gabriela&#39;s boyfriend?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grin broke through Josh&#39;s stunned expression, and he strode forward, voice bright with relief. &#34;Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Moss. So you&#39;re Gabriela&#39;s boyfriend? Now I get why she kept you away from the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley inclined his head in a curt nod that served as a greeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned to Gabriela, one brow arching.&#34;What&#39;s this-am I someone you need to keep hidden away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was taken by surprise by his question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Wesley leaning a little too hard into the role?Well,she decided to roll with the act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a coy smile, she stepped closer, her voice low and teasing. &#34;When you&#39;re this incredible, of coursel need to keep you a secret.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips curved in quiet approval. &#34;Wise choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other guests who heard their playful banter were at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A neat wall of bodyguards cut the space in two,leaving Wesley and Gabriela standing alone in the cleared center as if the rest of the guests had ceased to exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On both sides, people strained to see past the human barrier, their curiosity burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every gaze was fixed on Gabriela now, the sudden star of the evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Phyllis&#39;s smile had soured, her complexion turning an envious shade.</p>
