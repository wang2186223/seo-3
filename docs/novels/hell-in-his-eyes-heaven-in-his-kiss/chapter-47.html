                <p>Wesley&#39;s directive took Gabriela by surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s friends might have been insufferable, but each of their families had enough clout in the city-otherwise, Phyllis would never have kept them in her circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s move was bound to ruffle their feathers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Wesley&#39;s gaze shifted toward Gabriela, there was a faint shadow of annoyance in his eyes. &#34;What&#39;s this?You think I&#39;m pushing them too hard?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela immediately shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cautioned, &#34;Vivian&#39;s brother holds a fair bit of sway. And... there&#39;s talk that she has connections with the CEO of the Williams Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of what Gabriela knew came from Aubrey, who could dig up gossip the way a bloodhound found a scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether from the entertainment world or the upper echelons of society, Aubrey could sniff out insider news with ease--and she loved spilling it to Gabriela. Thanks to her, Gabriela kept a faint pulse on the quiet intrigues of the elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s expression eased unexpectedly, settling into that cool, imperious calm that suggested such people were hardly a trouble for him. Leaning back in his chair, he closed his eyes, as if the matter had already slipped from his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking her cue from his indifference, Gabriela held her tongue, though a private satisfaction curled in her chest at the thought of Phyllis and her friends&#39; humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a stretch of silence, a subtle weight pressed against Wesley&#39;s shoulder. His eyes opened to find Gabriela slumped gently against him, fast asleep. For a moment, he simply stared, pleasantly surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela had always maintained a careful distance from him, as if intimidated by his presence-yet today,she&#39;d dared to rest her head on him as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she simply exhausted?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a voice barely above a breath, Wesley murmured, &#34;Drive slower.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir,&#34; Billy answered, though his mind reeled in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was leaning against Wesley&#39;s shoulder. And instead of pushing her away, he actually seerned to welcome it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was usually a brisk half-hour ride became a leisurely hour before they finally pulled up to the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Gabriela stirred awake, the realization hit-she&#39;d been using Wesley&#39;s shoulder as a pillow. Heat rushed to her cheeks as she straightened, blurting an apology while swiping at the corner of her mouth on instinct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was relieved to find she hadn&#39;t drooled in her sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley didn&#39;t reprimand her for leaning on his shoulder. He let the corners of his mouth lift in quiet amusement before saying in a pleasant tone, &#34;Come on, let&#39;s go in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still dazed from her nap, Gabriela trailed after him without realizing she was draped in his coat. With a casual air, she stepped right into the company alongside him, even taking his private elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within thirty minutes, whispers rippled through the building-Gabriela had been spotted wearing Wesley&#39;s coat, igniting speculation and unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cali and her two friends were the most rattled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s growing favor with Wesley was starting to look dangerous for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one felt the pressure more than Cali, who had been haunted lately by vivid dreams-Gabriela, looking stunning in luxurious outfits, strode into the sales department as Mrs. Moss, before ordering security to march Cali straight out of the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that Gabriela had strolled back into the company wrapped in Wesley&#39;s coat only made her more agitated, racking her brain for a way to make amends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey, on the other hand, was positively gleeful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d long suspected Wesley had a soft spot for Gabriela, and now he&#39;d even draped his coat over her shoulders!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for the executive office&#39;s restricted access, Aubrey would&#39;ve marched right in to demand every juicy detail about what it felt like to wear Wesley&#39;s coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Aubrey succeeded in sneaking into the executive office, Gabriela likely wouldn&#39;t be able to say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the moment, she was thoroughly inebriated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drunk people behaved in various ways. Some turned loud and unruly, while others looked perfectly composed, their eyes as clear as if they hadn&#39;t touched a drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela fell squarely into the latter group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Wesley saw nothing wrong with her-until he noticed she was trailing him everywhere like a small,determined shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever his long strides pulled him ahead, her fingers would catch his sleeve, refusing to let him slip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there something you need to ask?&#34; Wesley glanced back, only to be met with her wide, luminous eyes,her expression soft and vacant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight was unexpectedly endearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then something clicked in his mind, sharpening his gaze. &#34;You&#39;re not drunk, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela ignored his question. Instead, her lips curved into a faint, dreamy smile. &#34;You&#39;re truly a good man,Mr.Moss.&#34; Her skin warmed under a delicate flush, the wine leaving its telltale tint across her cheeks. A smile bloomed -playful and innocent enough to make anyone want to lean in, to tease, to steal a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley had never been the type to deny his desires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cupped her face in his hands, savoring the warmth beneath his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle pinch coaxed her lips into a small pout, her wide, unguarded eyes gazing up at him in a way that stirred something tender within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>how much have you had?&#34; he said, sighing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the restaurant, she&#39;d downed each glass with the poise of a seasoned drinker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, that steady mask had slipped-her cheeks aglow, her eyes hazy-the alcohol had finally claimed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she acted this careless with other men, someone could easily take advantage of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a steady hand, he led her to the sofa, easing her down before taking a seat at her side.&#34;Any idea who you&#39;re talking to right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure I do,&#34; she replied instantly, her voice warm with tipsy cheer. &#34;You&#39;re Mr. Moss-my boss. And,honestly, you&#39;re a remarkably good man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s lips curved in quiet amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even drunk, she still knew how to flatter him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you tell me where we crossed paths for the very first time?&#34; he asked with a faint smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting her head slightly, Gabriela let a pensive silence linger before giving a nod-then just as quickly, she shook it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was fairly sure their first meeting had been on her interview day, yet some unshakable instinct told her that wasn&#39;t the whole truth. Wesley had no illusions about getting a straight answer from someone with alcohol still clouding their mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He steered the conversation elsewhere. &#34;That model of the undersea city-when did you put it together,and who was it meant for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow creased as if sifting through a foggy memory, then she let out a faint groan and touched her temple. &#34;My head&#39;s pounding. Can we talk about something else?&#34; she said softly, her tone almost childlike,as if pleading for mercy after a scolding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made no effort to press her. &#34;The lounge has a bed-go stretch out there. A nap will take care of that headache.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression turned earnest. &#34;MMr. Moss, thank you. You really are incredibly kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of heading for the bed, she wandered toward the kitchen and almost lowered herself onto the floor as if it were a bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quiet sigh, Wesley swept her into his arms and carried her straight to the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After settling her down, he told Billy to bring something to ease the hangover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Billy returned, Gabriela was already fast asleep-curled on her side, hands tucked beneath her cheek,the picture of gentle, untroubled innocence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley lingered by the bed for a moment, cradling the cup of hangover tea in his hand. His gaze softened as he bent to tuck the blanket snugly around her, ensuring no draft could reach her, before slipping out without a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Moss,&#34; Billy said, masking his surprise behind a neutral tone. &#34;There&#39;s a short meeting in ten minutes.Aaron and the others have returned. Do you want to begin as scheduled?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beyond his core executives, Wesley maintained a private think tank of six-handpicked elites, with Aaron Dean at the helm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have them come in,&#34; Wesley said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,sir.&#34; As Billy stepped out, he cast one last glance toward the lounge, curiosity flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door stood firmly closed, and the silence within offered no hint of life inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stirred, feeling as though she was waking from a dream that had stretched on forever. Her cheek rested against a pillow soft enough to swallow her whole, the blanket around her carrying that crisp, pine-tinged scent that could only belong to Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, she lay there in a fog-until the realization hit like a jolt of cold water. Why, of all places, was she in Wesley&#39;s bed again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rushed to her cheeks. She sprang upright, the blanket slipping away, and darted barefoot to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment it swung open, she froze-six members of Wesley&#39;s think tank were seated there, all turning in perfect unison to stare straight at her.</p>
