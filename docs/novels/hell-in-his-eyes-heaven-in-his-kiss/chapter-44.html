                <p>Mason walked over to Wesley, offering him an apology for being late.&#34;|got caught up at Century Square-some company was holding an event, and the crowd was so packed it blocked the road. That&#39;s why I&#39;m late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley waved it off, but Mason still felt the need to repeat his apologies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Gabriela, Mason greeted her warmly.pleasure to see you again, Miss Haynes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, just call me Gabriela,&#34; she replied quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right, then.&#34; Mason nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his age and statusas a major client, he carried himself without airs, speaking easily with Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley, however, kept a polite smile paired with an icy demeanor, just enough to hint at aloofness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela worried his cool manner might offend someone as important as Mason and risk losing a multi-million-dollar deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With practiced ease, she steered the conversation, drawing smiles from Mason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d met twice before, once at a banquet where Mason had been busy with other guests, and once on the golf course, where Gabriela had been attending to Wesley. Neither occasion had allowed much conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, seated across the table, Mason discovered her sharp eloquence and refined taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they talked, he learned she was skilled at building architectural models-detailed creations involving design, structure, and every element from foundation to finish-each infused with her own ideas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason, a devoted enthusiast of handcrafted architecture, lit up at the discovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela described her college project-a model of an undersea city, roughly 4 feet long and 2 feet wide. The whole city was submerged in miniature, evoking a distant, ancient world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It took me about a hundred days to finish,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, a gaming company had approached her to buy it as a game backdrop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d love to see it,&#34; Mason said with interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela hesitated. &#34;I&#39;m not even sure where it is anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She guessed the model might be buried somewhere in her room, gathering dust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have any pictures saved on my phone-otherwise, I&#39;d show you the finished product,&#34; she sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a pity,&#34; Mason said with regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something stirred in Wesley&#39;s mind as he glanced at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she spoke of the undersea city, her voice carried a quiet pride, and her eyes shone with unguarded triumph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the kind of confidence that naturally drew attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy, too, was surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d always known Gabriela to be diligent and well-educated, but he&#39;d never seen this spark before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he better understood why Wesley was interested in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason seemed equally taken with her and hoped she might build another one someday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I have time, I will,&#34; Gabriela said. &#34;And I&#39;d be glad to have your thoughts on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason laughed. &#34;I&#39;d love to see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she spoke modestly, her eyes still carried that confident gleam, enough to curl Wesley&#39;s lips into a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m looking forward to it too,&#34; he said. The meal went on, and Gabriela and Mason found themselves in easy rapport, regretting they hadn&#39;t met sooner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She even toasted him several times, despite Wesley&#39;s attempts to stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, every time she steered the conversation toward the deal, Wesley subtly deflected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela found it puzzling, but after several tries, she sensed Wesley&#39;s lack of enthusiasm for the deal and chose not to push it any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some drinks, Gabriela excused herself to use the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hallway to the restroom was long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On her way back, she passed an open private room and spotted Phyllis inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis looked effortlessly chic in her light gold coat and matching beret-every inch the fashion icon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was with Dustin and a few female friends, all busy complimenting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Phyllis, you&#39;re absolutely radiant today. I mean different. That outfit&#39;s stunning-and I&#39;ve never seen you wear this hat before. Where&#39;d you get it? It&#39;s gorgeous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis accepted the praise, offering to take them shopping sometime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dustin sat beside her, attentively serving her food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela knew the hat was hiding Phyllis&#39;s bald patches, which she found amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, a conversation with Phyllis was the last thing she wanted. Her pace instinctively increased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But a woman with red hair spotted her and stepped into her path. &#34;Gabriela? What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela ignored her and kept walking until another woman joined in, pulling her into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them sneered, &#34;Don&#39;t rush off! Tell us, are you working part-time here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here dining with my boss,&#34; Gabriela said coldly. Those women laughed, their eyes sharp with mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman smirked. &#34;Since when can you splurge on meals like this? Dining with the boss? Really? Where is he-introduce us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Grace Robuchon required membership, and they clearly didn&#39;t believe her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The red-haired woman scoffed. &#34;Stop pretending. We all know you&#39;re poor. What else would you be doing here except working part-time? Even if you were serving or washing dishes, we wouldn&#39;t mock you, but acting high and mighty makes you look ridiculous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, all eyes turned to Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis watched in silence, enjoying the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the others had taken their shots, she leaned in with a soft, patronizing tone. &#34;Don&#39;t you already have a job, Gabriela? Why are you still working part-time at a restaurant? Is money tight again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze flicked to Gabriela&#39;s designer clothes, jealousy flashing in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said in feigned concern, &#34;I know girls love designer things, but working part-time just to afford them isn&#39;t worth it. My dad promised your mom he&#39;d look after you, yet here you are, degrading yourself for the sake of vanity. If he knew, he&#39;d be heartbroken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dustin&#39;s expression soured, and he subtly shifted away, as though being near Gabriela were somehow embarrassing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis sighed. &#34;If you&#39;re really that short on money, I can lend you some.&#34;</p>
