                <p>At the question, Gabriela straightened up, posture suddenly rigid and alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Brenden had just been demoted,whispers claimed he was related to Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wouldn&#39;t risk criticizing Brenden in front of Wesley,so she forced a strained smile. &#34;Honestly, he&#39;s actually a pretty decent guy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s gentle façade vanished in an instant, his face clouding over. &#34;Decent? How so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already tried to sway her opinion of Brenden by sharing details about his womanizing ways. So why didn&#39;t she seem bothered by it at all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s heart hammered wildly as nerves took over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe her answer had been too vague. Was he annoyed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scrambled for something more convincing. &#34;Mr.Saunders is attractive, and he&#39;s always polite, very attentive, and honestly, he&#39;s quite generous.&#34; She had delicately avoided talking about his playboy ways. There was no way she&#39;d slip up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,Wesley&#39;s features turned even colder,his tone clipped and unreadable. &#34;You&#39;ve got the worst judgment when it comes to people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension pressed down inside the car, leaving Gabriela&#39;s knees weak and her heart fluttering in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slid closer to the window, practically melding into the cold glass, desperate for distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being chastised by Wesley upset her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suspected this was his way of venting his frustration over her hogging his bed last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden realization hit her like a lightning bolt.Maybe Wesley was just one of those people who woke up cranky, and his bad mood was finally catching up with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Gabriela let her thoughts drift, Wesley&#39;s sharp voice cut through the silence.&#34;Why are you sitting all the way over there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, then grudgingly scooted closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Billy stomped on the brakes. The car  jerked violently, nearly throwing her into the seat in front of her-until Wesley&#39;s arm shot out, catching her and yanking her safely back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tumbled straight into his arms, her cheek brushing the cool, tailored fabric of his suit jacket. Wesley&#39;s heartbeat thudded strong and steady beneath her ear,radiating a warmth that sent a wave of déjà vu through her. For a moment, she just sat there,momentarily caught off guard by how natural it felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head up, meeting Wesley&#39;s gaze.His eyes locked onto hers, dark and intense, as if he was struggling to mask something deeper beneath that calm exterior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up close, he was impossibly handsome-every line of his face sharper, every feature more striking under the car&#39;s dim interior light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela found herself frozen, caught by the magnetic pull of his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley snapped out of it first, a hint of restraint flickering across his features as he demanded, &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy, already half out of the car, glanced back.&#34;There&#39;s a pileup up ahead. I&#39;ll take a look,&#34; he swiftly answered, disappearing into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still tucked securely against Wesley&#39;s chest, Gabriela  struggled to steady her breathing, her mind spinning with questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did his embrace feel so inexplicably familiar? It reminded her of how Brenden had held her during their one-night stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she tried to collect herself, Wesley leaned closer, his voice dropping to a teasing rumble.my arms really that comfortable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela jolted upright, but in her panicked scramble,her hand collided with his manhood, which felt firm and unmistakably tense beneath her palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow flickered across Wesley&#39;s face, his eyes turning dangerously dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat surged up Gabriela&#39;s neck, flushing her cheeks an impossible shade of red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;S-sorry!&#34; she sputtered, tripping over her own tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley sucked in a quiet breath through his teeth, the sound sharp and unmistakable. Gabriela, mortified,murmured softly, &#34;Did I hurt you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she&#39;d hit him harder than she realized. God,could she have actually caused some pain?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley glanced down at her, his gaze inscrutable. &#34;No,it&#39;s just that I have a few scratches on my back,&#34; he  said, his voice cool but laced with an odd fondness.&#34;A kitten got to me a few days ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corner of his mouth twitched, betraying the faintest hint of amusement-even as he spoke of scratches, he didn&#39;t sound upset at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s surprise slipped out before she could stop herself. &#34;You have a kitten at your place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question seemed to catch him off guard, and for a second, his annoyance broke through. &#34;I haven&#39;t brought it back yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So it wasn&#39;t his cat-probably some stray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes grew wide as she went on,&#34;Wait-you got scratched by a stray cat? Stray cats can carry all kinds of viruses. Did you get it checked out? At least get a shot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley responded with a chilly, dismissive laugh, &#34;I don&#39;t need a doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His irritation seemed to thicken the tension in the car,making the air feel even more suffocating. Gabriela found herself edging back, hoping to put some distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just how many times could this man&#39;s mood swing in a single car ride? Dealing with rich people really took a special kind of endurance. A moment later, Billy climbed back inside, a trace of relief on his face as he reported, &#34;Mr. Moss, there&#39;s a minor accident up ahead. We&#39;ll have to take a different route.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley nodded, his tone steady and detached. &#34;Fine.Do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the detour delayed them so much that they were the last guests to step into the banquet hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet with Wesley&#39;s imposing reputation, nobody dared utter a word about their late entrance. Instead, the crowd&#39;s attention locked onto the striking woman at his side, whispers swirling as they tried to guess her identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The event took place at the Sapphire Valley Hotel, a glittering behemoth of luxury towering over the city skyline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Gabriela hardly noticed the opulence-she was too tense, still feeling the chill of Wesley&#39;s lingering displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley surged ahead, his long legs eating up the distance. Gabriela had to almost jog to match his relentless pace, her heels clicking frantically on the polished floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could catch her breath, he stopped short She plowed straight into his broad back, nearly flattening her nose against his tailored suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wincing,she clapped a hand over her face and hurried out an apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s mood seemed to have mellowed; he glanced over his shoulder and asked, &#34;Did it hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela bobbed her head,half-expecting a hint of sympathy, but all Wesley offered was a single, biting word.&#34;Clumsy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left utterly speechless, Gabriela realized his brief kindness had only been a setup for anotherjab at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man she&#39;d once admired for his reserved and noble demeanor now struck her as petulant, even petty, his dignity slipping to reveal a streak of childish vindictiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could open her mouth to say something,Gabriela noticed every pair of eyes in the room fixed on her.</p>
