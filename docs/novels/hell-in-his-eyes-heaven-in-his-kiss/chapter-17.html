                <p>Gabriela had never set foot in an event like this before.Surrounded by curious stares, she felt an unfamiliar tightness in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley offered his arm, a silent invitation. &#34;You don&#39;t need to be nervous,&#34; he murmured, his voice steady and low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slid her hand into the crook of his arm,her fingers clinging a little tighter than necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, the distant, untouchable Wesley-so often a cold,intimidating presence-suddenly radiated a quiet strength she could lean on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing beside him, she felt an unexpected calm,as if his presence alone could shield her from anything the night might throw her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they stepped into the venue, Gabriela was hit by the scale of the occasion. The air crackled with glamour and ambition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tycoons she&#39;d only glimpsed in glossy magazines mingled with A-list celebrities, famous faces from the silver screen gliding past in a blur of couture and diamonds. Everywhere she looked, she caught flashes of star power, dazzling and surreal, leaving her a little breathless as she tried to take it all in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley led Gabriela from one prominent figure in the business world to the next, pausing just long enough for polite introductions before moving on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found herself face-to-face with the CEO of a household appliance giant-his products notorious for being both outrageously pricey and somehow everywhere. He looked younger than she&#39;d expected,though his thinning hair betrayed a few late nights and too many board meetings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next was the wife of a powerful man, radiant in a designer gown that shimmered beneath the chandeliers. The necklace at her throat-surely the same one tabloids claimed she&#39;d dropped a fortune on -flashed like a lighthouse every time she laughed,drawing every eye in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela could barely keep up, swept along as Wesley navigated the crowd with effortless authority.He barely lingered, offering quick, almost perfunctory introductions-his attention reserved,his conversation short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when they reached another businessman did Wesley&#39;s posture straighten and his tone grow formal A steel-gray suit sharpened the man&#39;s lean frame. He looked to be around sixty, not especially tall, silver hair swept neatly back from a face carved with deep lines, though something gentle softened his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela recognized who he was at once. All that time spent studying up on Alphacom Electronics paid off -this was Mason Garner, the CEO himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt of surprise ran through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just this morning, she and Aubrey had brainstormed ways to connect with anyone from Alphacom&#39;s top executives. Yet now, here she was, with Wesley standing beside her, personally introducing her to Mason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason&#39;s eyes crinkled in genuine warmth as he greeted Wesley. There wasn&#39;t a hint of the thinly veiled superiority older executives often showed the younger set-only sincere respect in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Wesley smoothly turned his attention back to Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an easy smile, Mason glanced over. &#34;Aren&#39;t you going to introduce the lovely woman on your arm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela tensed,heart fluttering as Wesley replied with practiced calm, &#34;This is Gabriela Haynes-she works for my company. She&#39;s joining me tonight as my companion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t clarify her position, but every executive in the room immediately picked up on the implication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley had never taken a woman to an event like this before, indicating that there was more between them than simply a professional relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason&#39;s demeanor softened even further, and he offered Gabriela an effusive stream of compliments -calling her bright, capable, and striking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela met his gaze, her voice sincere. &#34;You&#39;re t00kind, Mr. Garner. I still have a lot to learn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason,clearly picking up on Wesley&#39;s desire to groom Gabriela, struck up a long, friendly conversation with her. By the end, he offered his number and even floated the idea of grabbing dinner together sometime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Gabriela, it felt like the chance to secure a billion -dollar partnership with him was winking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Mason only left after Wesley made a casual promise to have dinner together soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slipping Mason&#39;s business card into her purse, Gabriela dutifully trailed after Wesley, shaking hands with one  industry titan after another until her cheeks began to ache from nonstop smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All at once, she spotted a familiar face up ahead-Vincent Atkinson, the movie star everyone recognized on sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of delight bubbled up inside Gabriela</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d adored Vincent&#39;s films for years-catching a glimpse of her idol here, of all places, felt unreal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight&#39;s banquet had already paid off in spades; luck like this only came around once in a lifetime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela held back her thrill. Under any other circumstances, she&#39;d have dashed across the room,grinning, eager for a quick photo and an autograph from Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, teasing voice brushed her ear. &#34;So you think he&#39;s good-looking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s eyes sparkled as she nodded, unable to hide her giddy grin</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice dipped. &#34;What&#39;s so attractive about him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela didn&#39;t miss a beat. &#34;Vincent Atkinson is my idol! I never imagined he&#39;d be even more striking in real life. He&#39;s tall, magnetic,just...wow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the second the words left her lips, an icy draft seemed to sweep over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced up, and sure enough, Wesley&#39;s expression had darkened,his jaw tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She faltered, nerves creeping into her voice.Moss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;So, who&#39;s better looking-me or him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The answer was obvious-especially when he looked that irritated. Gabriela offered her brightest smile and poured on the flattery. &#34;Are you kidding? No contest at all, Mr. Moss. You&#39;re in a league of your own-the most handsome man on the planet!&#34;</p>
