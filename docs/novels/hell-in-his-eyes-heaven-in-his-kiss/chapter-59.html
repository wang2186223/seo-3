                <p>Phyllis wasn&#39;t the only one with a sour expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian, in particular, lost all color in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley was Gabriela&#39;s boyfriend? The thought made her stomach drop. How could that even be true?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the memory of those suffocating three days in detention crept back in, and suddenly it all fit together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If there&#39;d been nothing between them, why else would Wesley have gone out of his way to shield a mere employee?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pulse kicked up, unease tightening in her chest.If her brother caught wind of today&#39;s events, she was bound to get another scolding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around her, her friends were buzzing with barely contained astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s really Wesley Moss, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;ve only seen him in interviews-he&#39;s even better-looking in person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on-him and Gabriela? No way. They have to be faking this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way! He&#39;s all about staying low-key and keeps his distance from women. What kind of pull could Gabriela possibly have to get him to play along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were just circling Gabriela, mocking her and trying to humiliate her. Damn, we&#39;re in trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, their bravado cracked. Each replayed the snide remarks they&#39;d tossed out, wondering if they&#39;d gone too far-and whether Gabriela might decide to make them pay for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few attributed the slight toward Gabriela to Vivian&#39;s influence. If it hadn&#39;t been for helping her seek retribution, none of them would&#39;ve gone after Gabriela in the first place. Vivian&#39;s chest tightened with a mix of fear and loathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brother had once told her that the Crownridge Group-owned by the Moss family-was a multinational powerhouse, holding the number two spot in global revenue for nine consecutive years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Moss family&#39;s fortune was vast beyond measure,but its family tree was a snarl of rivalries, the infighting cutthroat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley had steered clear of that mess, refusing to be pulled into the feud. Instead, he&#39;d built his own empire from the ground up, and in just a few short years,he had carved out a place among the elite. He even had an office tower bearing his company&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plenty of young blood in the Moss family had brains and ambition, but Wesley was the only one his grandfather had openly acknowledged as the future heir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If nothing went wrong, he would become the head of the Moss family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Vivian dwelled on it, the sharper her envy became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of everyone in the world, it had to be Gabriela who caught Wesley&#39;s attention? The whole thing was downright insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,the banquet started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh was the only one the bodyguards didn&#39;t turn away. With his usual cheer, he remarked, &#34;Mr. Moss,Gabriela, don&#39;t just hover there-sit down, have a bite, and let&#39;s talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of the guests penned in behind a wall of black suits wasn&#39;t exactly flattering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Josh&#39;s sake, Gabriela gave Wesley&#39;s sleeve a light, almost pleading tug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that she was wearing the bracelet he had given her, he let a faint softness creep into his expression. A silent look passed from him to Billy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy replied with a subtle nod and signaled for the bodyguards to ease back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Vivian&#39;s fingers shook even harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela held this much sway? If she complained to Wesley, Vivian suspected her brother wouldn&#39;t just scold her-he might keep her locked at home for half a year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting an opening, Marie swept in with a bright,obsequious smile, angling to guide Wesley toward the head table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he dismissed her smoothly, his voice even. &#34;I&#39;ve got an urgent issue to handle, so I won&#39;t bejoining you at the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The edges of Marie&#39;s smile stiffened, threatening to crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d clearly come solely for Gabriela-and now he was about to walk right back out without even bothering to wait for the wedding ceremony to finish. It was as good as slapping Phyllis in the face in front of all the guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Phyllis became the object of mockery,how would she salvage her reputation, let alone conduct business later?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marie flicked several meaningful glances at Josh,silently urging him to pressure Gabriela into doing something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Josh, oblivious as ever, squinted at her instead.&#34;What&#39;s with your eyes, Marie? Haven&#39;t been sleeping enough these last two days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest tightened in frustration, words lodging in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, she had relished how readily Josh bent to her will, eager to accept whatever she handed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, his cluelessness left her feeling utterly exasperated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley paid them no mind, resting a light hand on the crown of Gabriela&#39;s head. &#34;Something&#39;s come up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Come with me and we&#39;ll deal with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela found her eyes fixed on his hand and felt her pulse skip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost without thinking, she nodded, dazed, a faint warmth spreading through her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh my God! He was distractingly good-looking...and maybe she was just a little too taken with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone gentled even further as he went on, &#34;Let your uncle know first. I&#39;ll be waiting outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with urgency tugging at him,Wesley was giving her every courtesy-bringing her along, yet allowing her the dignity of a proper farewell to her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warm surge of confidence swelled inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, Wesley had stepped in without hesitation, the steady safety net always there when she needed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She marveled at how fate had been so generous,placing her in the hands of a boss like him. After murmuring an apology to Josh, she broke into a light jog to catch up with Wesley-only for a man to suddenly block her path. &#34;Excuse me, are you Ms.Gabriela Haynes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blinking in surprise, she found herself facing a sharply dressed man in his late thirties. The black suit fit him to perfection, his square jaw and upright stance giving him a commanding presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like the think tank specialists who often flanked Wesley, he radiated a polished, high-society refinement from head to toe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Gabriela was certain she had never seen him before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; she replied politely, her tone cool but courteous. &#34;I think you might have the wrong person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erik Mckay&#39;s brows lifted slightly, as if her blank look caught him off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man who prided himself on never forgetting a face, he was confident he was speaking to the right person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m with Williams Group, overseeing our software development,&#34; he swiftly explained. &#34;We&#39;ve got a smart braille program nearly ready for launch. You were the one who set it in motion-don&#39;t you remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ve got the wrong person, sir.&#34;Gabriela lingered for a beat, searching her memory,then gave a small, decisive shake of her head. &#34;Sorry -someone&#39;s waiting for me. I have to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brushed past him without another glance,ignoring the flicker of confusion that crossed his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her steps quickened until she reached Wesley,who had been watching the exchange with a measured calm. As she drew closer, his voice carried a casual edge. &#34;So... how exactly do you know someone from Williams Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela tilted her head, brows knitting in mild puzzlement. &#34;Must be some mix-up. I&#39;ve never met him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wide, luminous eyes only grew more guileless when she blinked and let them widen ever so slightly,the picture of sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It really seemed like she was telling the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley studied her a beat longer, then gavea short nod.&#34;Get in the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy, trailing just behind, kept his observations to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d crossed paths with the Williams Group before and knew their inner circle well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erik, the CEO&#39;s right-hand man, was razor-sharp and far too discerning to confuse Gabriela with anyone else-especially when her features were this utterly striking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Billy would dig into it later, Wesley saw no need to dwell on the encounter. He stepped forward and pulled open the driver&#39;s side door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noting that he intended to drive personally, Gabriela slipped into the passenger seat without hesitation,the movement smooth and swift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight drew more than a few startled glances from onlookers-it was hard to miss the quiet tenderness in his gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy blocked Brenden from following them and then slid into another car with a couple of bodyguards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela fastened her seatbelt in silence, resisting the urge to ask where they were going. Wherever Wesley led, she was prepared to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips curved in a faint, knowing smile as the engine turned over, and the car eased away</p>
