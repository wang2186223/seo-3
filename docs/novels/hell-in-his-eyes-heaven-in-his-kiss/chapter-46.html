                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough!&#34; Dustin, who had been watching from the sidelines with a clenched jaw, suddenly barked,stepping forward as if ready to pry Gabriela away himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could reach her, the restaurant manager came hurrying over, his voice cutting through the tension. &#34;Surveillance footage is ready. Anyone who lost something, take a look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for anyone&#39;s opinion, he signaled the staff, and the footage lit up on the wall for all to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made everything plain: from the moment Vivian walked in, she had never lost anything-and Gabriela had never picked up a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A murmur rippled through the crowd. No one had expected the manager to check the surveillance footage on his own, much less play the evidence in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd exchanged glances, their expressions shifting-curiosity giving way to something far more complicated as their gazes landed on Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,it had been a setup from the very start. It&#39;s really shameless of her to pull such a cheap trick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t she part of the Vasquez family? We better warn our family to stay away-mixing with her will only tarnish our name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The murmurs cut through the air like tiny blades, and Vivian&#39;s stomach twisted into a cold knot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela hadn&#39;t expected the restaurant manager to step in without so much as a word from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she turned, her gaze caught on Wesley-standing just beyond the crowd, tall and unyielding,his presence radiating quiet authority that drew every eye without effort. His striking featues were carved into a cold, unyielding scowl, chin lifted&#39;with quiet defiance, a chill rolling off him like winter air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet in that instant, she felt Wesley as an unshakable pillar at her back-solid, immovable, someone she could finally lean on without fear of collapsing. Billy shouldered his way through the murmuring crowd, his presence cutting through the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The restaurant manager stepped forward at once, his tone almost deferential. &#34;Does this resolution meet your approval, Mr. Clarke?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy&#39;s gaze swept over to Vivian, cool and measured. &#34;Get the police involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of dread shot through Vivian. &#34;What? Who the hell are you? WNhat gives you the right to report me to the police?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy ignored Vivian entirely and, with a gentle smile meant only for Gabriela, said, &#34;Come on,let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She trailed after him toward Wesley, tilting her face up to meet his gaze. &#34;Thanks for that, Mr. Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fool,&#34; he said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word cut sharp, but before she could respond, he shrugged off his suit jacket and draped it over her shoulders.&#34;Wear it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d gone and thrown herself into trouble without even thinking to call for help. If he hadn&#39;t grown uneasy about her being gone so long and sent Billy to find her, would she have tried to clean up that mess alone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still... the fire in her eyes told him she wouldn&#39;t have walked away defeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason&#39;s tone carried a firm edge. &#34;Gabriela, when something like this happens, don&#39;t waste your breath arguing.Call Mr.Moss right away-he&#39;ll stand behind you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela lowered her gaze, murmuring an obedient admission of fault before hastily slipping into Wesley&#39;s jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fabric was cold and rigid at first touch, yet beneath it lingered a faint, steady warmth from Wesley&#39;s body. That quiet heat wrapped around her like a shield, and for a fleeting moment, the sting in her chest made her want to cry. For the first time, she truly believed she had someone she could lean on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the restaurant manager had already called the police. Vivian was taken in for slander and sentenced to a three-day detention. It was a lenient sentence, especially considering she had gone so far as to have Gabriela&#39;s coat stripped off in public. But for a pampered young lady like her, the humiliation alone was punishment enough-a stain on her pride she would never wash away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The police station refused to grant bail, insisting she spend the full three days in detention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian seethed, her voice rising with disbelief. &#34;Phyllis, Gabriela&#39;s just an intern. How on earth could her boss be defending her like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis faltered, lowering her voice as if sharing a secret. &#34;Theother day, I went to her company to drop off the wedding invitation... and happened to see her accepting a gift from SK Elite Boutique.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of their friends gasped, &#34;SK Elite? That&#39;s insanely pricey! Their membership requirements make Grace Robuchon look cheap. How could she possibly afford it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis leaned closer, speaking in a hushed, knowing tone. &#34;She might have a rich boyfriend-that would explain why her boss is so protective. A few nights lately, I&#39;ve spotted her slipping into a luxury car. I&#39;ve never seen the man, though. Almost like she&#39;s hiding who he is from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s jaw tightened, fury flashing in her eyes. &#34;If she really has a secret boyfriend, he&#39;s probably somne wrinkled old man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis lowered her voice. &#34;Please don&#39;t say that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian couldn&#39;t care less if her words were too harsh; her only concern was getting out of police custodýbefore the situation spiraled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If her brother caught wind of this, she was finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll try talking to Gabriela,&#34; Phyllis offered smoothly. &#34;Maybe we can settle this quietly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That finally cooled Vivian&#39;s temper, if only a little. &#34;I&#39;m in your debt, Phyllis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting another second, Phyllis and Dustin rushed back toward the restaurant-arriving just in time to see Gabriela about to slip into the waiting car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis hurried over, stepping in front of her with a forced, anxious smile. &#34;Gabriela, you and Vivian used to be classmates. This was just a misunderstanding-no need to blow it out of proportion, right? Can&#39;t you just let her off the hook?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you call this a misunderstanding?&#34; Gabriela&#39;s expression stayed cold, her voice clipped. &#34;She searched me in public and even tore off my coat. Besides, it was my boss&#39;s decision to involve the police-not mine to reverse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For my sake, can&#39;t we just let it go?&#34; Phyllis pressed, her tone dripping with entitlement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as she pleaded, she regarded Gabriela with cool detachment-chin tilted, confidence radiating as if the outcome were already in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s lips curved in a thin, sardonic smile. &#34;For your sake? Did you forget what you and your mother did to me? You took my mom&#39;s house as if it were your own. On that very first day you moved in, you went straight to mny closet and took all my clothes. And your mother latched onto my mother&#39;s company while refusing to cover my tuition!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of icy malice darted through Phyllis&#39;s eyes as her fingers whitened around the handle of her designer bag. Still, her expression stayed composed, her tone deliberately calm. &#34;I know you&#39;re still mourning your mother, but that doesn&#39;t give you the right to spew wild accusations and claim my family&#39;s property as your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s gaze didn&#39;t waver. &#34;Deny it all you like-my mother&#39;s name is still the one on the deed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gabriela, try having some dignity!&#34; Dustin&#39;s voice cracked like a whip, sharp and accusing. &#34;Take a good look at yourself-acting petty and clinging on just because you&#39;ve won this round! It was nothing but a small misunderstanding. You&#39;re clearly unharmed, yet you keep lashing out-snapping at everyone. Phyllis is letting your insult slide-be grateful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela met his glare with an unshaken calm, her tone cold as glass. &#34;For someone depending on a woman to get by, you&#39;d better watch your tone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat shot through Dustin&#39;s chest, his breath hitching with the urge to lash out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He honestly couldn&#39;t fathom how Gabriela-who&#39;d once treated him with mild politeness-had morphed into someone so razor-edged with her words. Could Phyllis be right? Did snagging a wealthy older man inflate Gabriela&#39;s ego this much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, he kept his mouth shut. He still needed Phyllis&#39;s help if he wanted to climb higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After delivering a blistering verbal lashing to the shameless pair, Gabriela slid inside the car, only to be met by Wesley&#39;s glacial stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered a quick, placating smile. &#34;Don&#39;t be upset, Mr. Moss. I&#39;ve already cut them down so hard they&#39;ll be licking their wounds for weeks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s chiseled face didn&#39;t so much as twitch. He turned to Billy, his tone as cold as his expression.&#34;Bring the restaurant manager here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir,&#34; Billy replied at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within minutes, the manager came bustling out, forehead slick with sweat. Bowing slightly, he asked with deference, &#34;What would you like me to do, Mr. Moss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Run the surveillance footage from earlier,&#34; Wesley replied, his tone cool and deliberate. &#34;Loop it in the most visible spot in the lobby-for the next three months.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Consider it done, sir.&#34; The manager paused, shifting uneasily.&#34;And... should we still serve the guests shown in the footage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow of icy malice flickered in Wesley&#39;s eyes. &#34;Go ahead and serve them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy&#39;s brows shot up, astonished. Now that was ruthless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three months was plenty of time for every diner who stepped through the doors to memorize those shameless faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when Phyllis and her friends returned to the restaurant, only to be greeted by their own humiliation playing for all to see... they&#39;d likely wish the gound would split open and swallow them whole.</p>
