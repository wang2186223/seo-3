                <p>Rhys&#39;s arm grazed Gabriela&#39;s, and a cold wave of disgust rippled through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go, or I&#39;m calling the police,&#34; she snapped, her voice sharp enough to cut glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips curled into a smug, almost taunting grin. &#34;Please. Police don&#39;t step in when a guy&#39;s just putting his girlfriend in her place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of Gabriela&#39;s colleagues nearby shifted uneasily, glancing at each other but not moving to help.Then Rhys&#39;s voice rose, laced with venom. &#34;She&#39;s my girlfriend! Been running around with some wrinkled sugar daddy for a couple of fancy dresses and handbags-cheating on me the whole time. And today? I&#39;m teaching her a lesson. So stay out of it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes turned on Gabriela, some edged with disbelief, most with quiet contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her looks, they thought, it wasn&#39;t hard to believe she&#39;d trade affection for luxury-and worse, betray the man she was with. Chasing after some rich old man-how utterly vile and humiliating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela froze,blindsided by the sheer brazenness of his lie. Her voice rang out, sharp and clear. &#34;Don&#39;t listen to him! He&#39;s not my boyfriend!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, really?&#34; Rhys&#39;s lips curled in a mocking sneer. &#34;Then why did you take my flowers?&#34; His gaze turned cold, his tone shifting into something more like an order. &#34;Come home with me and apologize. If I&#39;m ina good mood, I&#39;ll still buy you the pretty things you like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela twisted hard against his grip, panic tightening in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he got her into that car, there was no telling what he might do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one swift motion, she swung her&#39;free arm and struck him-her palm connecting with his cheek in a sharp,echoing crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys froze, eyes wide in shock, one hand pressed against the reddening welt on his cheek. Whatever false polish he&#39;d worn a moment ago shattered, replaced by a snarl. &#34;You filthy whore! Who do you think you are,hitting me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arm shot up, rage twisting his features as he prepared to strike back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of Gabriela&#39;s wrists was still trapped in his iron grip, her muscles straining in vain. Panic clawed at her chest-his shadow loomed over her, the blow seconds fom landing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before it could fall, a strong hand caught Rhys&#39;s wrist in midair, fingers locking like a vise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Rhys whipped hishead around, fury still blazing-only to find a tall man in a tailored black suit,his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get lost! This is none of your damn business!&#34; Rhys snapped, his voice.trembling with indignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy, the man in the black suit, flicked a glance toward Wesley, who stood a short distance away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s usual composure was laced with icy disdain, his eyes cutting sharp as if to say, &#34;Do I really need to spell this out for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy understood at once. His jaw set, and his fingers clamped down like a steel vice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp crack echoed, and Rhys let out a strangled howl. &#34;Who the hell are you? What do you want? My hand&#39;s gonna break-let go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Billy&#39;s grip only tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain drained the color from Rhys&#39;s face, cold sweat beading along his temples. With a choked gasp, he finally wrenched his fingers free of Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela shook free at last and made her way toward Wesley, only to be met by the chill in his eyes-a look that froze her in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A realization struck her. She&#39;d just dragged the company&#39;s name through the mud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wordlessly, she slipped to the side, hoping to make herself small.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Wesley pivoted, his gaze locking on her like a hawk&#39;s. His voice was low, clipped, and brooked no The edge in his tone made her stomach tighten. She moved at once, steps small and careful, slipping in behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around them, the crowd stirred with a ripple of astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So the whispers had been true after all-Wesley did treat Gabriela diferently. And this was no idle workplace rumor; everyone could see it now, plain as day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe Wesley&#39;s protectiveness toward Gabriela ran deeper than anyone had guessed-why else would he let Billy stand up for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret rippled through the crowd. If they&#39;d known she truly had Wesley&#39;s favor, they wouldn&#39;t have stayed frozen on the sidelines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one kicked themselves harder than Cali and her two friends-they&#39;d squandered their one chance to make amends, and now the window had slammed shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help...&#34; Rhys&#39;s panicked shout cracked in the air before he collapsed to his knees, desperation twisting his features. &#34;Please, sir-let&#39;s just talk! Let me go, I&#39;m begging you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy&#39;s grip looked deceptively casual, but the tension in his forearm told anoter story-his control was absolute, the kind that came from years of disciplined training. Rhys felt as if his wrist were one breath away from breaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the moment it hit him-he had just gone head-to-head with the wrong kind of people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy&#39;s gaze turned razor-sharp. &#34;Apex Group isn&#39;t your playground. Step foot here again, and I&#39;ll make sure you get a beating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys bobbed his head frantically, his voice trembling. &#34;Y-yes, I was ignorant. I swear, I&#39;l never come near the company again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood that Billy was merely the guard dog. The true master stood a few steps away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys turned toward Wesley, desperation twisting his face. &#34;Sir, I swear l&#39;ve learned my lesson.Please, just let me off this time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley lifted a hand in a subtle,dismissive wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy instantly released Rhys and closed the distance to Wesley&#39;s side, posture taut, waiting for the next command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley closed the distance in long, deliberate strides, his shadow swallowing Rhys where he stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which hand did you use to lay a finger on my people?&#34; HHis voice was quiet, but it cut through the air like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s heart, which had only just begun to steady, lurched painfully in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The protectiveness in his words sent her emotions into a whirlwind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys shrank back under the weight of Wesley&#39;s gaze, his bravado dissolving. Swallowing hard, he extended his right hand like a schoolboy confessing a crime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s eyes narrowed, cold and unyielding, the look in them making it clear-Rhys was going to deal with this himself, or suffer worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys grasped the situation instantly. He raised his right hand and smacked himself across the face, each blow sharp and echoing, spitting out curses at himself between strikes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley didn&#39;t waste another glance on him. With a cold, unhurried stride, he headed toward the parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few steps, he realized &#39;Gabriela wasn&#39;t beside him. He glanced over his shoulder, his expression sharp, that chiseled face as,cold as marble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Gabriela quickly fell into step, hurrying after him and sliding into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The colleagues who had witnessed it all stood frozen, still trying to process what they&#39;d seen. Wesley wasn&#39;t just protecting Gabriela-he was going out of his way for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys stood utterly defeated-hundreds squandered on roses, every last shred of dignity ripped away in front of the crowd. The moment Wesley&#39;s car disappeared from sight, he yanked out his phone and ordered a ride to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The examination was brutal on his pride-a shattered fracture in his wrist, the kind that would take days just to ease the pain, let alone heal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage bubbled up in his chest, and he spat venom through clenched teeth. &#34;You damn bitch, Gabriela! Sure,your boss is backing you now. Let&#39;s see how long that luck sticks. Next time, you won&#39;t be so fortunate!Damn! How dare you act like an unattainable princess around me while spreading your legs for some old sugar daddy? Who the hell do you think you&#39;re fooling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before his tirade could burn out, his phone buzzed with Phyllis&#39;s name flashing across the screen. He answered, unleashing another string of curses, his voice sharp with spite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis listened, her tone softening into a feigned sigh. &#34;Ever since we were kids, she&#39;s been stirring up trouble-and somehow, there&#39;s always a guy ready to shield her. Sorry you got caught up in this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The apology only seemed to stoke Rhys&#39;s fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened, and a dark promise formed in his mind-he would make Gabriela pay, and soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the drive back, Wesley remained silent, his profile as unreadable as stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela kept her gaze fixed on the window, hands folded tightly in her lap, every bump in the road echoing the tension in her chest. Her thoughts looped back to the moment he&#39;d stood up for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she forced herself to reason it away-he&#39;d likely done it because the company&#39;s reputation was at stake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela felt uneasy under,his deep, unreadable gaze, worried he might cut her paycheck in half for the earlier commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the car slowed near her street, she broke the silence, forcing a polite smile. &#34;Thank you for stepping in today, Mr. Moss. I&#39;ll work twice as hard to repay your kindness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s low laugh was cool and edged, his eyes flickering with a trace of mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear it won&#39;t happen again,&#34; she added quickly. &#34;I won&#39;t bring any more shame to the company.&#34; Her expression made it painfully obvious-she was pleading with him not to cut her salary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, the sight only tightened something in his chest. His jaw hardened, and his voice dropped to a curt rumble. &#34;See that you don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
