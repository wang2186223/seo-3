                <p>Chapter99 He&#39;s Gained A Few Extra Pounds</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela froze, baffled, her lips parting as she was about to ask Brenden what on earth he was thanking her for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then she noticed the strange gleam in his eyes and the twisted curve of his expression, which reminded her of his schizophrenia. Was he hallucinating again,imagining she had done something to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill rippled through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not another episode! Not again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who knew what bizarre request he might spring on her this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced a polite smile. &#34;You&#39;re welcome, Mr.Saunders. It&#39;s late, and I&#39;m really exhausted. If there&#39;s nothing else, I&#39;ll just head to my room and get some sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden inclined his head with unusual calm. &#34;Good night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched with growing fascination as Gabriela practically fled, disappearing down the hall. How interesting. The women before her had always leapt at the faintest hint of his attention,practically draping themselves over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Gabriela, madly infatuated as she was, ran away the moment he opened the door for something more</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found her shyness even more intriguing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela had braced herself for battle, convinced that &#34;NotASaunders&#34; would send some infuriating message to ruin her night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as the clock crept past midnight and her phone stayed stubbornly silent. Her tension unraveled, and sleep claimed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she stirred the next morning, sunlight spilled across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First thing, she checked her phone. There were no messages from &#34;NotASaunders,&#34; but a string of texts from Aubrey popped up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela discovered that several luxury brands-once loyal partners to Claire-had publicly announcedthe termination of their contracts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And to top it off, the production team of a hit romance drama dropped a bombshell on Twitter: Claire, once their leading lady, had been replaced-swapped out for a fresh-faced actress with more talent, if not fame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey followed the news with a row of laughing emojis, practically gleeful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela typed back a crisp reply. &#34;Serves her right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey wasted no time delivering her theory. &#34;Why did Claire suddenly get blacklisted? Gabriela, this might actually have something to do with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela blinked. &#34;Huh? Why would I have anything to do with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey&#39;s reply was swift. &#34;Claire&#39;s been quiet lately The only thing she&#39;s posted was a couple of updates supporting Phyllis. You know exactly who&#39;s orchestrating Claire&#39;s downfall. This has your protector&#39;s signature all over it. Clearly, this has to be an act of love. But, if you still can&#39;t see that, maybe it&#39;s time you open your eyes and figure that part out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her protector?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes,Wesley treated her different from how he treated others at the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it had to be something else. Maybe he enjoyed her cooking. Or perhaps it was because Loretta and Miriam favored her, leading him to extend a bit more courtesy toward her. An act of love? Absolutely not</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela shook her head vigorously, as if to banish the very idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta wouldn&#39;t throw around wild claims about her grandson not being interested in women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And really, if Wesley had harbored any romantic feelings about her, that night would have revealed it.The atmosphere had been intimate enough, yet he had restrained himself completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s kindness wasn&#39;t personal. It was just who he was. He went out of his way to help her because he was a decent person. And for that,she should find some way to repay him properly in the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela gave herself a sharp mental warning about entertaining ridiculous ideas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She even patted her cheeks briskly, snapping herself back to reality, before scrolling through her unread WhatsApp messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey wasn&#39;t the only one flooding her inbox. Phyllis had sent a barrage of messages too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gabriela, everyone insults me now.Vivian won&#39;t even talk to me. You&#39;ve left me with no friends. You must be thrilled!&#34; &#34;Don&#39;t get too cocky! I won&#39;t let this slíde!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gabriela, you bitch. P&#39;ll make your life miserable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s texts had spiraled, over a dozen messages brimming with curses, as if she&#39;d completely lost her grip. Eventually, when Gabriela still hadn&#39;t replied, the tirade sputtered out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela skimmed the rants, too disinterestedto even roll her eyes. Without bothering to retort,she simply blocked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, stretching a little, she rose and swept the curtains open, letting the daylight pour in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, a soft rain whispered against the windows,ushering in the first real breath of spring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta returned from the countryside with two oversized boxes stuffed with local specialties her relatives had pressed on her: creamy artisanal cheeses,jewel-bright jars of jam, and delicate handcrafted chocolates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela sampled a few, and her delight was instantaneous. Eyes sparkling, smile blooming, she looked for all the world like a child set loose in a candy shop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta&#39;s heart warmed at the sight, though a pang of frustration followed close behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she liked this girl, the more it stung that Wesley was such a disappointment. How could he not appreciate such a treasure? How would he ever find someone worthy if he couldn&#39;t recognize what was right in front of him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze slid sharply toward Wesley, her disapproval practically searing through him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked back, puzzled by the silent accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Brenden, amused by Gabriela&#39;s joy,drawled, &#34;Wesley, you probably won&#39;t touch any of these. Why don&#39;t you just let Gabriela take them all home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela looked startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of it? How could she possibly finish so much on her own?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s expression hardened, his voice clipped and cold. &#34;Gabriela, these kinds of sweets cause acne. Eat them sparingly. If you come to work with a face full of pimples, it will damage the company&#39;s image.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela bit back the urge to roll her eyes so hard they might get stuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t shake the suspicion that Brenden and Wesley were deliberately teaming up to tease her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, as much as she adored the snacks, a girl had to think of her skin. Vanity won out over appetite, and she didn&#39;t dare take too many.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered a courteous smile and sidestepped the comment with ease. &#34;Mr. Saunders, maybe you should try a few more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden&#39;s face brightened instantly. &#34;Then how about we share them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s expression, by contrast,	darkened immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta, either oblivious or intentionally ignoring the tension, chimed in with a chirp of cheerfulness, &#34;You two enjoy! I&#39;ll fix some honey lemon water; that will get rid of the acne worries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s only reply was a sharp, frosty snort before he strode off toward the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, he had been prickly, temperamental even Gabriela navigated each interaction like walking on glass, taking the farthest seat at the table just to avoid his ire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, the harder she tried to tread lightly, the more his displeasure seemed to grow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her telief, her time working part-time was nearing its conclusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s brief stint at the manor had quietly stretched to thirteen days</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Loretta pressed her wages into Gabriela&#39;s hands,the sudden sting of gratitude brought unexpected tears to her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had assumed Wesley had already advanced her ten years&#39; wages, so this time she was just cooking for free as promised, not daring to expect any payment for her part-time work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her surprise, Loretta handed her every last penny,and even slipped a small gift into her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gabriela, next time you&#39;re on break, you absolutely must come back for part-time work. Honestly, having you cook for Wesley has done wonders; he&#39;s gained a few extra pounds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela beamed. &#34;No problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta waved a hand toward Wesley, a teasing sparkle in her eyes. &#34;See for yourself, Gabriela! His cheeks aren&#39;t so sharp anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley stiffened, a flash of irritation crossing his face. Compliments should have pleased him, so why did they sting?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because he had always taken care of his physique. All this drivel about adding on a few pounds was just unnecessary!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden grinned and nudged him. &#34;Oh, come on,Wesley. Are you actually gaining weight? I&#39;ve been eating Gabriela&#39;s food too, yet somehow, I&#39;m still perfectly slim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s eyes darkened, his temper shadowing the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the sudden chill, Brenden&#39;s knees threatened to buckle, and he bowed his head so fast it was almost comical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, clutching her wages, had intended to leave immediately-but Loretta had other plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wesley&#39;s got work tomorrow. You&#39;ll ride back to the company with him,&#34; she declared, almost playfully commanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela paused, hesitation appearing on her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley spoke casually, his tone even. &#34;If you leave tonight,mny driver would have to make a special trip to drive you back. Just stay tonight and we can head to the company together tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to trouble his driver, Gabriela nodded.She might as well stay another night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, she wandered into the back garden for a breath of fresh air. To her surprise, she spotted Wesley jogging under the dim glow of the garden lamps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Moss? Why are you running at this hour?&#34; she asked, a note of curiosity in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot her a cool, detached glance. &#34;Your cooking is too good. I&#39;ve gained a few pounds, so I&#39;m working it off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela blinked, never imagining that excelling in the kitchen could somehow provoke dissatisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carefully, she added, &#34;Perhaps you shouldn&#39;t push yourself too hard. Your heart isn&#39;t in the best condition right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowed slightly, conceding, &#34;You&#39;re right. I&#39;ll take it easier.&#34; &#34;But jogging doesn&#39;t burn many calories, so l need to double the time. And running alone is boring Why don&#39;t you come along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela froze,stunned. Yet soon she found herself jogging beside him, trying to keep pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t quite wrap her head around how her gentle concern for his health had led to her becoming his jogging partner.</p>
