                <p>Chapter83 Could You Sing Something For Me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after Brenden&#39;s figure vanished from sight,Gabriela remained frozen in place, her mind reeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had suspected that &#34;NotASaunders&#34; wasn&#39;t Brenden at all, but judging by his reaction moments ago, was she wrong in her speculation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what had Brenden meant when he claimed he couldn&#39;t give her what she wanted? Was he planning to keep whatever she&#39;d left in that hotel room?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury blazed through Gabriela&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden showered other women with generosity,yet treated her with such calculated cruelty. He kept stalling,refusing to return what belonged to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What an absolute bastard!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela drew a shuddering breath, forcing her rage into submission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she considered it rationally, this outcome worked in her favor. Brenden had suggested cutting contact himself, whch meant no future scandals to worry about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, she couldn&#39;t even recall what she&#39;d abandoned in that hotel room-she probably didn&#39;t need it anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts churned through a dozen emotions,and gradually, satisfaction replaced her anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crushing weight that had pressed against her ribs finally lifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She inhaled deeply, transforming back into the carefree woman she&#39;d always been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gabriela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s frigid voice cut through her reverie like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her euphoria had made her forget Wesley still lingered in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank God she hadn&#39;t been too explicit while testing Brenden earlier-Wesley probably hadn&#39;t deciphered their cryptic exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flashed him a brilliant smile. &#34;Mr. Moss,getting some water? I won&#39;t keep you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela finished speaking and bolted toward her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She indulged in a scalding shower, so blissful she nearly burst into song.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After toweling off, Gabriela scrolled through her phone until 11:30 PM crept up on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d planned to stay awake another half hour, but tomorrow&#39;s responsibilities crashed back into her consciousness-Loretta needed help decorating the house and trimming the garden&#39;s overgrown trees and flowers. She&#39;d have to rise at dawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela powered down her phone, burrowed into her blankets, and set her alarm.  Just as sleep began to claim her, WhatsApp&#39;s distinctive chime pierced the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It rang several times in succession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela cracked open her phone to discover a message from &#34;NotASaunders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sleeping? I can&#39;t rest. Could you sing something for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stared at the screen in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden had just declared he wouldn&#39;t return her belongings or contact her again, and now he already changed his mind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What an asshole!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having already confronted Brenden directly, Gabriela felt no need for diplomacy. Her reply dripped with venom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brenden Saunders, do you possess the memory span of a goldfish? What is it- three seconds before everything evaporates? You explicitly said never to  contact me again, so why are you messaging me now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley had been battling insomnia for days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s rejection had wounded him, though he convinced himself he wasn&#39;t particularly attached to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she possessed such abysmal taste as to criticize his physique, he certainly wouldn&#39;t waste another moment&#39;s consideration on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d assumed he would get over her quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But recently, she haunted his vision constantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He learned that she had endured absolute darkness in the past while still maintaining such radiant optimism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than moving on from her, his fascination intensified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, he&#39;d tossed restlessly, his mind replaying the scene of Gabriela standing before Brenden. He was quite frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn! What was so special about Brenden that had drawn her to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation drove Wesley to message Gabriela,requesting a song.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t anticipated provoking such fierce indignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reading her message, in which she furiously berated Brenden, somehow lifted Wesley&#39;s spirits considerably.Her fiery temperament amused him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He responded cheerfully, &#34;Oh, it&#39;s Gabriela?thought this was girlfriend number forty-three. Sorry,wrong recipient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding that insufficient, Wesley added, &#34;My forty-third girlfriend happens to bea little singer. If you can outperform her, I&#39;ll return your possessions immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s blood boiled.  Why was he tormenting her in the dead of night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to wake early tomorrow to assist Loretta with decorating!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela marshaled her fury, prepared a verbal assault, and readied a voice message bombardment when &#34;NotASaunders&#34; sent another text.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m a free spirit; naturally, I change my mind constantly Forget what I said earlier. Tonight, you wil sing for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was about to detonate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what choice did she have? Her own reckless behavior had created this mess-getting drunk over trivial matters, which had attracted this relentless pest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terrified that Brenden might broadcast their one-night stand, Gabriela swallowed her rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her jaw and typed, &#34;What song do you want?&#34;The response materialized instantly. &#34;Something romantic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s blood chilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of delusional romantic was Brenden,demanding love songs in the dead of night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she knew a hundred romantic ballads,she wouldn&#39;t feed his twisted fantasies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know any romantic songs,&#34; Gabriela shot back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then find one. Sing something sweet once you&#39;ve chosen.I have all night-I&#39;ll wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela drew a savage breath, mentally executing Brenden a dozen different ways before hitting record.Her voice emerged barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I could do just one thing for you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This marked the first time she&#39;d ever performed for someone through her phone. Shyness scorched her cheeks. Initially, her voice trembled with embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The recording automatically transmitted when it reached the sixty-second limit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s voice wasn&#39;t classically beautiful,but her tender singing caressed the listener like whispered secrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley had initially found it enchanting, even losing himself in her melody as he contemplated which song to request next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as the lyrics unfolded, his smile withered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love you so deeply, so I&#39;ll set you free...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s expression turned thunderous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loving someone so profoundly, yet releasing them?Encouraging them to choose another?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shouldn&#39;t loving someone mean clutching them desperately and never letting go?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These lyrics were absolute poison!  Wesley fired back immediately, &#34;Awful. Choose something else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, who had been pleased with her performance, recoiled at his brutal dismissal.</p>
