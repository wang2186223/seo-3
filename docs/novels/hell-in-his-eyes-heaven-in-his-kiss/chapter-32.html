                <p>Though Phyllis clearly hated to admit it, even she couldn&#39;t deny that Gabriela worked for an influential powerhouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her boss, Wesley, was a rising star in the corporate world-his name splashed across financial reports, his face on the glossy covers of top-tier magazines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On top of that, he belonged to the formidable Moss family, a name that commanded deference every time it appeared in the media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For someone like Gabriela, who seemed rooted in an unremarkable life, to be connected to a man of such stature felt almost absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, however, had no patience for Phyllis&#39;s relentless bullshit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Believe it or don&#39;t-it&#39;s the truth,&#34; she retorted sharply, stepping toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis sidestepped into her path, her expression tightening as she launched into her usual theatrics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put on a mask of concern and turned to Josh, her voice dripping with false sincerity.&#34;Dad,I might as well tell you the truth. Gabriela had feelings for Dustin too. But Dustin&#39;s heart belongs to me, and he chose me in the end. Since Dustin didn&#39;t return her feelings, she went after a wealthy businessman instead.Nothing wrong with him,really-except he&#39;s quite a bit older.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela marveled at Phyllis&#39;s flawless talent for distorting reality and drew in a breath to fire back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh,however, looked devastated, the weight of her words hitting him hard. His face tightened in anguish.&#34;Gabriela, you graduated from one of the top universities. I poured my savings into your education, even supported you through graduate school, and this... this is how you repay me? You&#39;ve brought me nothing but shame.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice cracked, and soon he was sobbing openly, tears coursing down his weathered cheeks. Gabriela clenched her jaw, forcing herself to keep her cool as the guilt trip rolled over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marie fidgeted awkwardly, too mortified to say anything, yet clearly eager to see how Gabriela would respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis pressed on with her melodrama. &#34;Gabriela, if you&#39;re really struggling, just come to us. My mom would never let you go hungry or let you wear shabby clothes. There&#39;s no need to cling to that old businessman,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dustin&#39;s lip curled in open disdain as he piled on, his tone sharp. &#34;I&#39;ve told you before, Gabriela-no matter what stunt you pull, I&#39;m never coming back to you. You&#39;ve only managed to disappoint me further. End things with that man now, before you drag the family&#39;s name through the dirt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s patience snapped. She let out a cold laugh, her gaze cutting into him. &#34;You survive on a woman&#39;s dime,Dustin.Just because Phyllis is young and pretty, you call it love? But if my boyfriend&#39;s older and not exactly a heartthrob, suddenly I&#39;m a shameless gold digge? Are you kidding me? That&#39;s ridiculous. When it comes to double standards, you&#39;re in a league of your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hit Dustin right where it hurt, and all the color drained from his face. Rage flickered in his eyes,as if he might snap at any second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh stopped wailing mid-sob, left blinking in confusion by Gabriela&#39;s unexpected retort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis scrambled to keep the peace, quickly soothing Josh before spinning on Gabriela, her voice sharp with accusation. &#34;If you&#39;ve got nothing to hide, and your so-called boss really drove you home,then why not have him step out and say hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fixing her with an icy glare, Gabriela shot back, &#34;Meeting my boss isn&#39;t something that happens just because you want it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis let out an exaggerated sigh. &#34;You&#39;re getting slandered left and right, but your boss can&#39;t be bothered to come out and set the record straight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, the window of the sleek black Porsche glided down, revealing the refined, chiseled profile of a man whose very presence seemed to command the night.His gaze-cool, clear, and steeped in quiet authority-swept across the scene, making everything else fade into irrelevance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stunned hush fell over the onlookers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t that Wesley-the Moss family&#39;s heir, the same man who&#39;d been making headlines in every major financial publication?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley didn&#39;t spare the others a single glance. Instead, he looked straight at Gabriela, his lips curving into a composed,effortless smile.getting late, Gabriela. Head home and get some rest. We&#39;ve got work in the morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That brief smile carried an authority that seemed to charge the air around him. His effortless confidence left Dustin shrinking away, unable to meet his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela hadn&#39;t expected Wesley to step in, and a rush of gratitude welled up in her chest. She answered with a genuine, grateful smile, &#34;Got it. Good night, Mr. Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how stingy he could be, deep down, Wesley realy was a decent guy. In that moment, Gabriela silently promised herself she&#39;d work twice as hard to repay his kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Wesley could leave, Marie hustled forward, her tone overly sweet with flattery. &#34;Mr. Moss, it&#39;s such an honor. Gabriela can be so thoughtless sometimes-she shouldn&#39;t have bothered you for a ride home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marie, who usually wielded her words like a blade, now bowed her head in deference, her fawning so transparent it bordered on embarrassing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley answered with an easy composure, &#34;Gabriela stayed late at the office, so I offered her a ride. Tell me,what made you think I was some old businessman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marie&#39;s smile faltered as she scrambled to appease him. &#34;Oh, Mr. Moss, you mustn&#39;t take it seriously. It&#39;s just Phyllis talking nonsense. Everýone knows how accomplished you are-starting your own company at such a young age!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Wesley step in on Gabriela&#39;s behalf made Phyllis burn with envy. The sight was intolerable. She couldn&#39;t stop herself from blurting, &#34;I wasn&#39;t talking about you, Mr. Moss. But Gabriela really is seeing an older man and hiding it from us. I&#39;m just afraid she&#39;ll make a foolish choice-ending up with someone twice her age just for money...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!&#34; Marie cut her off sharply, her palm cracking across Phyllis&#39; cheek. &#34;Get over there and apologize to Mr. Moss this instant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis froze, one hand pressed to her stinging face, eyes wide in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since her family had seized Gabriela&#39;s mother&#39;s house, she had been coddled like a prized jewel-her parents never raising their voices, let alone their hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet today, because of Gabriela, she&#39;d been struck in front of everyone. Humiliation burned in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dustin lingered awkwardly nearby, while Wesley-effortlessly striking even behind the wheel-remained seated in his car, a figure of cool detachment. Phyllis bit her lip, but refused to bow her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Wesley, she was nothing more than an annoyance. Without sparing her a glance, his deep voice cut through the air. &#34;It&#39;s late. You guys should go home. Don&#39;t interfere with Gabriela&#39;s rest. She has important matters to handle tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message was unmistakable-Gabriela wasn&#39;t just an employee; she was entrusted with work that mattered. And anyone thinking of crossing her would be wise to think twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marie&#39;s eyes darted nervously as Wesley&#39;s veiled threat echoed in her mind. She rushed out apologies,nodding along with every demand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley whipped the car around and vanished into the shadows, leaving silence in his wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marie composed herself, then faced Gabriela with a brittle smile that didn&#39;t reach her eyes. &#34;So, Gabriela,since when did you get so close with Mr. Moss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela shot a quick look at Josh, who was sniffling and wiping at his cheeks, then answered with a cool shrug, &#34;I&#39;m his secretary now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news seemed to brighten Marie instantly. Her smile stretched wide as she clasped Gabriela&#39;s hands inboth of hers, her tone turning syrupy. &#34;You really have come a long way. I suppose all those years f invested in you finally paid off. Phyllis was careless earlier and managed to offend Mr. Moss. If you get a chance,bring him by sometime, would you? We ought to make things right and apologize in person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under Marie&#39;s leadership, the Haynes Group had made progress and managed to turn a profit, yet true prestige remained just out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d cooked up a calculated scheme: invite Wesley over, put on a show of intimacy, and use that illusion to unlock valuable opportunities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela saw right through the ploy but kept her composure, masking her disdain with a faircourteous smile. &#34;Your intentions are as hard to miss as a billboard lit in neon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marie&#39;s expression stiffened, a retort poised on her lips, but she swallowed it, wary of Gabriela&#39;s current standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis, unable to stomach Gabriela&#39;s sudden rise, couldn&#39;t hold her tongue.&#34;What&#39;s there to gloat about?You&#39;re just a secretary-still clinging to some old man. Honestly, Mom, Dad, this time she just lucked out.But her dirty little secret will explode into the open one day!&#34;</p>
