                <p>Gabriela froze for a heartbeat,blindsided by Wesley&#39;s insight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he possibly have guessed what was on her mind? Had he already learned about her one-night stand with Brenden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought alone made her pulse quicken. Forcing her lips into a polite curve, she replied evenly, &#34;I&#39;m not here to see Mr. Saunders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh? Is that so?&#34; Wesley&#39;s gaze drilled into her-dark,unreadable,laced with a faint edge of impatience. &#34;As far as I know, you&#39;re still just a sales department intern.So why exactly are you on the twelfth floor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind scrambled for an answer. The easiest escape would be to butter him up and hope it worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with Wesley, whose moods shifted like quicksilver,one wrong word could backfire spectacularly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d tried flattering him before-sometimes it had bought him a smile, other times only a cold look.Never had it earned her anything of substance-not even a token bit of overtime pay, let alone a permanent spot at the company. Perhaps, she&#39;d been playing the wrong game all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley wasn&#39;t the type to bask in compliments. If anything,he seemed to enjoy being scolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought she&#39;d finally cracked a piece of his puzzle -yet one look at that impossibly handsome face,and every biting remark she might have mustered dissolved on her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her cycle between wary hesitation and dawning comprehension, Wesley could practically read her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere idea of Brenden staining his reputation had his fists itching to drag him back for another beating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of his wrist, he dismissed her, his tone edged with cool detachment. &#34;Get back to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grateful for the reprieve, Gabriela wasted no time slipping out, hurrying back to the sales department.Aubrey barely glanced up before calling across the room,&#34;Gabriela, there&#39;s a company notice!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried to her desk and opened the company email.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bold text leapt out at her. &#34;Brenden Saunders has been found responsible for spreading rumors about our CEO. As disciplinary action, he will be reassigned</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to the Clawei Sea well-digging project effective immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stared at the screen, momentarily frozen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claei Swea was all the way out in Afluena-if Brenden was shipped there now, would he even make it back before the New Year?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d already gone through enough trouble just to secure this fake boyfriend arrangement, and now Brenden had gotten himself into a mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, with that level of brainpower, his romantic resume of thirty-eight girlfriends defied all logic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she stewed, Aubrey&#39;s voice chirped right in her ear &#34;They&#39;re calling it a project assignment,but really,it&#39;s punishment. He&#39;ll be digging wells. Turns out Mr.Saunders&#39; little rumor about Mr. Moss being a masochist was totally bogus. I knew it was nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela almost laughed at Aubrey&#39;s shamelessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This from the very same person who&#39;d been practically buzzing with excitement to share that juicy bit of gossip earlier-and then let it slip to half the office</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey wasn&#39;t finished. &#34;Oh, and I heard he made a massive scene at the meeting. Stood right up and called Mr. Moss a jerk in front of everyone. No wonder they&#39;re shipping him off to Afluena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s stomach sank. With this mess blowing up,there was no way he&#39;d be back before the New Year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And without him, where on earth was she supposed to find another man to drag along to Phyllis&#39;s wedding?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fired off a quick message to &#34;NotASaunders.&#34;&#34;Why are you being sent to dig wells? How long is this project going to take?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley stormed back into his office,his mood already black. Seeing Gabriela&#39;s text only soured it further. He shot back a blunt reply. &#34;I don&#39;t know!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt of panic racing down her spine. &#34;Is this because you spread that rumor about Mr. Moss being a masochist?&#34; she typed furiously. &#34;Why can&#39;t you keep your mouth shut? Even if it&#39;s true, you should&#39;ve kept it to yourself. And now what? Are you planning on spending the rest of your life in Afluena digging wells?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s jaw flexed as he read her message, every word steeped in her frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reply made his grip on the phone tighten until it nearly cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shut his eyes, forcing the irritation down before he typed,&#34;The rumors are false. Completely fabricated.Don&#39;t believe a word of it.&#34;Gabriela was caught off guard when she read those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in his tone didn&#39;t match the usual cocky bravado. Could it be that Brenden had finally learned his lesson and decided to act like he had a shred of sense?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her shoulders eased as she tapped out another reply.&#34;You&#39;d better watch yourself from now on. Don&#39;t go running your mouth about the boss. I&#39;m warning you -he&#39;s petty enough to blow up over nothing.I used to butter him up every day, but he just ignored me and refused to pay for my overtime. He&#39;s a ruthless businessman who likes to exploit his employees. What possessed you to spread nonsense about him? You&#39;ve dug your own grave. Listen, give it a few days for him to cool off, then go apologize properly. You might earn his forgiveness and be transferred to headquarters soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s thoughts were plain as day-if Brenden would just heed her advice and offer a heartfelt apology to Wesley, Brenden could come home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That way, she wouldn&#39;t be scrambling for another fake boyfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley,however, had no idea what schemes were running through her head. All he saw in her messages was an almost palpable concern for Brenden spilling out of the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression darkened as he texted back, &#34;Ruthless businessman? Exploit his employees? So that&#39;s how you see Wesley?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shift in his tone made her uneasy. Brenden sounded genuinely angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it because, as Wesley&#39;s relative,he could openly insult him while she wasn&#39;t even allowed to speak ill of him behind his back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could piece it together, a new message from &#34;NotASaunders&#34; popped up. &#34;I took screenshots of your messages and sent them to Wesley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, she simply stared, brain stalling. Then the shock ignited into fury so fierce her fingers itched to dig into her phone like it was Brenden&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That fucking bastard! She&#39;d gone out of her way to comfort him, and he&#39;d turned around and sold her out to Wesley without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was doomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting the blood draining from Gabriela&#39;s face, she leaned in,brows knitting. &#34;Gabriela, what&#39;s wrong? Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela nodded. She&#39;d managed to offend both Wesley and a two-faced snake like Brenden. There was no salvaging this;she could only wait for the axe to fall and start clearing her desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she forced herself to breathe, to think. Her postgraduate certificate would be issued soon. With that and her internship on her résumé,she could land somewhere else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being fired during an internship would be an ugly stain,though. Maybe she was better off quitting before they had the chance to show her the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, weighed down by sadness and unable to concentrate, sat quietly at her desk scrolling through job listings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her focus broke when the sharp click of heels echoed across the sales department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa Ortiz swept in-Wesley&#39;s personal secretary,the woman who ran the executive office&#39;s assistant team with military precision, second in authority only to Billy and trusted enough to be at Wesley&#39;s side in nearly every meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her appearance here could only mean something important was about to unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager of sales department hurried out, a broad smile plastered on his face. &#34;Ms. Ortiz, what a surprise What brings you down here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa drew a crisp sheet of paper from her folder and passed it to the manager. &#34;Year-end is chaotic, and the executive office is running short. We&#39;ll need to transfer someone from this team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush fell over the room, as everyone was caught off guard by such a revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apex Group-one of the fastest-rising giants in the industry-hired only the best. Even entry-level clerks needed résumés stamped by elite universities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The executive office was another world entirely, its staff boasting an average of postgraduate degrees;Tessa herself held two master&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Landing a spot there wasn&#39;t just a promotion-it was a golden ticket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager scanned the notice with deliberate care,his eyes narrowing slightly as he reached the last line,where Wesley&#39;s bold, unmistakable signature commanded the page.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of surprise crossed the manager&#39;s face before he masked it witha cordial smile and strode toward Gabriela. &#34;Gabriela, Mr. Moss has personally acknowledged your abilities. You&#39;ve been appointed as a secretary in the executive office.Congratulations.&#34; Gabriela stiffened, her brain scrambling to catch up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just crossed Wesley, and now she was being sent to work under his nose. That hardly sounded like a promotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley clearly wanted to get back at her-what a petty man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey seized her arm, practically bouncing. &#34;Gabriela,do you realize what this means? You&#39;ll be right there,working beside your dream guy every single day!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the thrill in Aubrey&#39;s voice only deepened the knot in Gabriela&#39;s stomach. She kept her lips pressed together, too uneasy to answer.</p>
