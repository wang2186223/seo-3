                <p>Phyllis&#39;s expression twisted as she lunged for Gabriela&#39;s phone. &#34;You&#39;re actually recording me? Wow.I should&#39;ve known you&#39;d pull something this dirty. Do you really believe this trick will help you snatch Dustin away? Keep dreaming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela slid her phone into her bag, her eyes icy.&#34;Please. Dustin&#39;s just a piece of garbage.&#34; She smirked,voice dripping with sarcasm. &#34;Honestly, you&#39;re doing me a huge favor by taking out this trash. If you want to act like he&#39;s some priceless treasure,be my guest.Just don&#39;t expect me to fight you for trash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s hands shook with fury, but the fire in Gabriela&#39;s gaze-and the threat of that recording-kept her at bay. She could only choke out, &#34;You&#39;re just jealous because you&#39;ll never have him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela slipped back to her room and let the hot shower wash over her,hoping it would chase away the last of her irritation. Putting Phyllis in her place felt satisfying in the moment, but unease still gnawed at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite everything, she couldn&#39;t deny that Phyllis&#39;s  father, Josh, had always been decent to her. There was no way she could refuse his invitation to the wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of seeing all those former classmates,knowing they&#39;d shower her with questions about her ex-boyfriend, made her stomach knot with dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, a new frustration landed on her doorstep. Josh, newly back from his trip overseas, had a talk with Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t even fifty yet, but his hair had already turned half-gray, a detail that somehow made his insistence feel even heavier. He always wore sleek black frames, his demeanor polished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In every way, Josh was admirable, except for the fact that he was always pushed around by his wife, Marie Haynes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever he couldn&#39;t convince Gabriela to do something, he&#39;d resort to tears without fail,and every single time, she&#39;d end up relenting with a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Gabriela felt genuinely glad to see him.&#34;Uncle Josh, you&#39;re finally back. How was your trip to Ceswienia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh managed a tense smile, the worry etched in the lines around his eyes. &#34;Marie and I spent the whole trip searching for wedding venue inspiration. Honestly,it was more exhausting than relaxing-just nonstop work.She launched herself straight into work the moment we touched down-didn&#39;t even set foot at home first.It&#39;s...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching on that he was about to launch into another never-ending complaint, Phyllis let out a subtle cough to steer him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh blinked, snapped out of his train of thought, and wrapped Gabriela&#39;s hand in his own, laughing kindly &#34;I&#39;ve met Dustin. I&#39;m more than satisfied. In fact, I owe you one. If it weren&#39;t for you, Phyllis never would&#39;ve landed such a fantastic match.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela marveled at Phyllis&#39;s shamelessness and played along, raising her brows in mock astonishment.&#34;Oh, you really don&#39;t need to thank me. Phyllis snagged exactly what she wanted, all on her own-she&#39;s quite the strategist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s expression froze. Hadn&#39;t Phyllis claimed Dustin was Gabriela&#39;s former classmate, and Gabriela was the one who set them up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint of frost flickered in Phyllis&#39;s eyes, but she was quick to slip her arm through Gabriela&#39;s, pasting on a sisterly smile. &#34;You&#39;re such a joker, Gabriela. Dustin&#39;s so popular-he&#39;s got girls lining up for him. I had to pull out all the stops just to win him over.&#34; Then Phyllis turned to Josh, her brow furrowed with concern. &#34;Dad, I already have a boyfriend, but Gabriela&#39;s still single. She must be feeling a little down,and honestly, I&#39;m worried about her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh let out a heavy sigh, clearly worried about Gabriela&#39;s feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis pressed on, her voice sweet but insistent.&#34;There&#39;s this professor in our department-his son&#39;s a decent man. He&#39;s smart, ambitious, and just so busy he hasn&#39;t had time to date. Maybe Gabriela could meet him? It might be good for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh, taking Phyllis at her word, turned hopeful eyes on Gabriela, eager for her to agree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Gabriela turned down that idea without hesitation.&#34;Uncle Josh, I&#39;m only twenty-four. There&#39;s really no reason for me to rush into anything like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis persisted, her tone softening as she tried to coax Gabriela. &#34;The guy makes almost a million a year,and he&#39;s really a good match for you. Just meet him,okay? If you&#39;re not interested, no one&#39;s forcing you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint shimmer of tears rimmed her eyes. &#34;I&#39;m about to get married, and you still don&#39;t even have a boyfriend. If your mom were still here, she&#39;d probably say we haven&#39;t looked out for you at all.&#34;Josh&#39;s face tightened with emotion at the mention of Gabriela&#39;s mother. He swallowed hard, his own eyes misting over. &#34;Your mom entrusted you to me. Seeing you like this... I can&#39;t help but feel I&#39;ve let her down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was fed up with Josh&#39;s guilt trips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever Marie and Phyllis made her life miserable,she&#39;d try venting to Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he&#39;d just listen, swallow Marie&#39;s version whole,and sigh, &#34;Your mother trusted me to look after you.Watching you struggle like this-I can&#39;t help but feel guilty...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure,Josh had always treated her kindly, but he never stood up to Marie. He handed her the company,caved in every argument, and let her walk all over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Gabriela realized that kindness alone wasn&#39;t enough-Josh just didn&#39;t have the backbone to protect her. Later, she learned to fend for herself and kept her distance from Marie and Phyllis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, as an adult finally able to fight back against that malicious mother-daughter duo, Josh&#39;s guilt still left her feeling trapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a weary breath, shoulders drooping in reluctant surrender. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll meet him.&#34; Josh&#39;s expression softened, his voice full of encouragement. &#34;Relax, Gabriela. If even Phyllis is vouching for him, he must have something going for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela flicked her gaze toward Phyllis, just in time to catch the fleeting spark of smugness in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever game Phyllis was running, Gabriela was more intrigued than anxious to see how it would play out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day happened to fall on Christmas Eve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela brought a white dress with her, hanging it discreetly in her office. As soon as her shift ended,she changed, draping a pale coat over the dress before heading out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her entire look radiated a subtle elegance with just a hint of innocence-enough to draw a delighted whistle from Aubrey the moment she stepped into view.&#34;Wow, Gabriela, you look incredible today! Big date with your boyfriend or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela shrugged it off with a small smile. &#34;Nope.My uncle&#39;s just forcing me into a blind date.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey rolled her eyes, exasperated. &#34;Seriously? At your age-why is he rushing you into this? Your uncle&#39;s really ridiculous.&#34; At that moment, Wesley strode by. They managed a quick hello, but he barely glanced their way, offering only a stiff nod before disappearing into the CEO&#39;s exclusive elevator, his face unreadable.</p>
