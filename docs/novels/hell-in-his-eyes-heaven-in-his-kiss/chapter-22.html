                <p>Wesley had barely begun typing his reply to Gabriela when his phone rang with an incoming call from his grandmother,Loretta Larson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wesley, it&#39;s your birthday today. Come have dinner at my place tonight,&#34; Loretta said, her voice warm and expectant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After his mother&#39;s passing, Loretta had stepped in to raise him. Their bond ran deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be there,&#34; Wesley promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ended the call, noticed it was nearly five o&#39;clock,and told Billy to get the car ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta&#39;s home sat tucked away in the quiet suburbs,a long drive from Wesley&#39;s company. By the time the car eased into her driveway, the sky had already turned a deep blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping out, Wesley immediately spotted Brenden standing by the porch, hands shoved in his pockets.Wesley&#39;s eyes narrowed, the faintest crease in his brow betraying his annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden, as oblivious as ever, waved him over with boyish enthusiasm. &#34;Wesley! I knew you&#39;d show up for dinner tonight. It&#39;s been a long time since | saw Loretta,and since it&#39;s your birthday, I thought I&#39;d crash the party too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden&#39;s father was the younger brother of Wesley&#39;s father-making them cousins by blood. After his parents split, Brenden had ended up with his mother -who was rarely around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing up, he&#39;d attached himself to Wesley, trailing after his older cousin through childhood and spending more time under Loretta&#39;s watchful care than with his own mother. Maybe that was why he and Loretta connected so deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley merely acknowledged him with a brief nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sticking close, Brenden fished a gift box from his bag -wrapped meticulously, ribbon and all. &#34;Happy birthday,Wesley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The date never failed to weigh on Wesley; his birthday landed on the same day his mother had died. No one in the family ever made a fuss about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Brenden had always insisted on bringing a present each year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley accepted it, his voice level. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy quietly stepped in to take the box, handling it with care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They moved forward together, the three of them passing into the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta was mid-conversation with a young woman,her animated gestures filling the room with a lively energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As footsteps echoed across the polished floor,Loretta glanced up and her whole face lit with joy. Rising from her seat, she reached out to take Wesley&#39;s hands in her own, her eyes shining with unmistakable grandmotherly affection. &#34;Wesley, you&#39;ve gotten so thin! Are you eating enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rare, gentle smile softened Wesley&#39;s features.&#34;Grandma,&#34; he greeted, his voice low but fond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden arrived a beat later, eager to get in his own greeting. Loretta pulled him in for a hug, treating him with the same radiant affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a delighted little flourish, Loretta turned to the young woman at her side. &#34;Wesley, do you remember this lovely girl? This is Fiona Dewitt. You two were in elementary school together-doesn&#39;t that bring back memories?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s brow furrowed, an uneasy suspicion flickering in his eyes. So much for a simple family dinner. Was he being set up on a blind date?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona stiffened for a heartbeat, caught off guard by the sight of Wesley in person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d researched thoroughly before agreeing to meet him. She understood Wesley had a reputation as a rising titan in the business world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she hadn&#39;t anticipated was his sheer presence-he commanded the room effortlessly, and he looked even more striking than she remembered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly masking her surprise, Fiona folded her hands in her lap and waited, poised and silent, for Wesley to break the ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden, whose weakness for pretty women was legendary,straightened with interest and shot Wesley a mischievous wink. With a teasing undertone, he murmured, &#34;Guess today&#39;s your lucky day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s eyes turned glacial. One warning glare from him had Brenden&#39;s bravado crumbling; the playful smirk vanished and he immediately fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Wesley addressed Loretta, a trace of weary affection in his voice. &#34;Grandma, what&#39;s going on here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta explained, &#34;Fiona&#39;s just come back from her studies abroad-she&#39;s earned her PhD! Beauty and brains all in one package. She heard it was your birthday, so she came all this way just to celebrate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona set a meticulously wrapped present on the table,her cheeks tinged pink. &#34;Happy birthday, Wes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley replied with a nod,his expression frosted over with indifference,&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping his tone civil but drawing a clear boundary,he added, &#34;Ms. Dewitt, just call me Wesley. I&#39;m uncomfortable with you using that endearment for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chilly reserve needed no further explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona blinked, completely taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d always been confident in her beauty, her doctorate, and the opportunities her lineage provided.Men usually bent over backward for her-how dare Wesley treat her like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being brushed off so bluntly was completely new to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks burned with embarrassment and anger.Biting her lip, she turned toward Loretta, glossy eyes swimming with unshed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta&#39;s smile faded, her tone turning mildly reproachful &#34;Wesley, Fiona&#39;s our guest. You could stand to be a little friendlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of deference to his grandmother, Wesley swallowed his irritation and managed a stiff, remote apology. &#34;Sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona&#39;s frustration only deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he treat someone like her-elegant,successful, impossible to overlook-with such indifference?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Wesley&#39;s striking looks almost made up for his frosty manners; she could overlook a little arrogance in a man who looked like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gathered herself, smoothing her expression into something poised and refined. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it.Feeling a little out of place after so long is only natural,Wesley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley let her words hang without a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eager to lighten the mood, Brenden leaned in with an easy grin. &#34;Hey, Fiona, remember me? Brenden Saunders-I was in your class too, back in elementary school.With Wesley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona managed a gracious smile, her voice perfectly cordial. &#34;Nice to see you again, Mr. Saunders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outwardly she kept up her polished facade, but inside  she barely spared Brenden a thought, already dismissing him as unworthy of her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he carried Moss family&#39;s blood, Brenden used his mother&#39;s last name, and the family&#39;s fortune never touched his life. None of the Moss business or assets were his to claim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for her own need to maintain appearances in front of Loretta, Fiona wouldn&#39;t have spared Brenden a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden, hopelessly charmed by a pretty face and completely blind to Fiona&#39;s indifference, leaned in with a hopeful grin. &#34;Want to add me on WhatsApp?Let me buy you dinner sometime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona unlocked her phone and exchanged contacts with him. Then she immediately turned toward Wesley,phone in hand, her tone casual but unmistakably pointed. &#34;Wesley,I just realized-we&#39;re not connected on WhatsApp either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Loretta&#39;s gaze on him, Wesley had no choice but to comply. He accepted her request, expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta, visibly delighted by the display of youthful harmony, clapped her hands together. &#34;Go on and chat, the three of you. I&#39;ll get dinner ready-it won&#39;t take long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough,Loretta returned, arms full of steaming dishes, and called everyone to the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She absolutely doted on Fiona, urging her to eat more and constantly adding food to her plate, her approval shining through every gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance sparked behind Fiona&#39;s lashes, gone as quickly as it appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That grimy fork had obliterated any trace of hunger,but she forced herself to smile through it, determined to appear gracious for Wesley&#39;s sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley,arms folded,watched her performance unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the meal ended, Loretta bustled over and tapped Wesley&#39;s shoulder. &#34;Wesley, Brenden-sit with Fiona for a while. I&#39;ll whip up some drinks for everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden didn&#39;t want to be the third wheel, so he angled himself toward the opposite end of the couch,already half-distracted by his phone as he shot off a quick message to his girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona edged a little closer to Wesley,letting herself lean into the solid comfort of his presence. Her voice came out soft. &#34;Wesley...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I have to catch up on some work,&#34; he interrupted, not looking at her as he slid his phone  from his pocket. He offered a clipped, polite nod, then focused on his screen, thumbs moving deliberately as he scrolled through unread notifications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the top sat his last WhatsApp chat with Gabriela-a blunt refusal from her to make him pasta. The memory pulled at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found himself wondering what Gabriela was doing now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Actually, Gabriela was busy in the kitchen, sleeves rolled up and hair tied back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a master at talking herself into surrender-and tonight proved no exception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long for her to realize that cooking was nothing next to the danger of getting fired from Apex Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Phyllis was out for the evening, Gabriela slipped into the kitchen and enlisted her cook&#39;s help. In no time,she had a pan of pasta simmering on the stove,the rich aroma curling through the air and making the whole kitchen feel inviting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved on to the borscht, working with quick,practiced hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching from the edge, the cook, Ken Belmont,couldn&#39;t help but praise her. &#34;Honestly, your cooking might even surpass mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela returned his smile, her eyes bright with mischief.&#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making borscht was child&#39;s play, but those arrogant texts on her WhatsApp kept replaying in her mind,souring her mood. Irritated, she started tossing ingredients into the pot with reckless abandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you don&#39;t eat cilantro or onions. Nothing too sweet. No strong flavors, and no chili. Let&#39;s see how you handle this,&#34; she muttered under her breath,grabbing fistfuls of sugar and chili and flinging them in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ken could only stare, speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quietly rued his earlier praise as the soup transformed into an unappetizing mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With brisk efficiency, Gabriela ladled the potent soup into a thermal container, snapped the lid shut, and hailed a cab for the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She arrived before seven, only to find the main doors locked tight against the evening chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shivering on the steps, she pulled out her phone and shot off a text to &#34;NotASaunders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When will you arrive?&#34;</p>
