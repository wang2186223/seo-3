                <p>Chapter86 You Look So Silly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the servants hovered nearby, eager to assist, Loretta briskly shooed them away to tend to other duties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That left Wesley alone at the front door, wrestling with the decorations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He soon found his hands were stained with grimy dust, and his left cheek bore the marks as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of the usually composed, untouchable man in such a state was unexpectedly comical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela couldn&#39;t hold back her laughter. &#34;Mr. Moss,your face is covered in dust! You look so silly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her laughter rang out, light and melodic, though it seemed to grate on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, he leaned forward and brushed his hand across her cheek. &#34;There! Now yours is dirty too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela froze, momentarily stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he truly being this childish?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rolled up her sleeves and boldly reached for his other cheek with her dirty hand. Her fingertips skimmed his cheek, light as silk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The touch shouldn&#39;t have meant anything, and yet Wesley&#39;s chest tightened as if she&#39;d struck a chord he didn&#39;t know existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one swift motion, his hand closed around her wrist.His gaze locked on hers, dark and unwavering, the kind of stare that made the air feel heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela froze, pulse skipping. Perhaps, she had taken things too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, he was her boss, and she shouldn&#39;t have teased him like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was very inappropriate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One corner of his mouth twitched as he let her go, though the weight of his hand lingered like a brand.&#34;Stop messing around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; she said quickly, absently tracing the very spot his hand had touched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His presence made her breath hitch in her throat,and a flush warmed her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tugging at her collar, she shrugged off her jacket to cool herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath it, a soft lavender T-shirt hugged her frame,the round neckline drawing attention to her collarbones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s gaze flickered there for a split second before he turned away. &#34;Stop dawdling. Some of us have real work to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela bent to retrieve the decorations, and the hem of her T-shirt rose, offering a fleeting glimpse of bare skin. Wesley&#39;s gaze flickered and immediately averted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who could have guessed that hanging streamers and ornaments wvould test him more than sealing billion-dollar contracts overseas?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, his earlier warning had her working with the focus of an employee on a strict deadline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her newfound seriousness, the second floor was finished in no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta&#39;s orders didn&#39;t end at the villa. Now the garden&#39;s trees and flowers were waiting for their festive touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela trailed after Wesley, but before they could begin, a sharp, pained cry split the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah! Stop! That hurts. Don&#39;t push it any further!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The source of the commotion became clear a moment later. It was Brenden, locked in an unfortunate stretching session with Cassius. Or rather, Cassius was doing the stretching, and Brenden was doing the suffering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden, clearly unaccustomed to anything more strenuous than lifting a wine glass, was flailing under Cassius&#39;s iron grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassius, I swear my leg&#39;s about to snap! I don&#39;t want muscles like yours. Just take it easy, alright? No need for the full drill-sergeant routine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassius&#39;s expression didn&#39;t budge. &#34;What do you think I&#39;m being paid for? Standing around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With merciless precision, he pressed Brenden&#39;s bent knee down even further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another tortured yell ripped from Brenden&#39;s throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s eye twitched with part sympathy,part schadenfreude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a way to spend the holiday season.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then again... maybe he deserved it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her, Wesley shot her a glacial look, holding it for several long seconds before his voice came, cool and cutting. &#34;Grandma told you to decorate the garden. Not stand around gawking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela quickly tore her eyes away, fumbling for an excuse. &#34;I wasn&#39;t gawking.I was admiring that man&#39;s muscles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s brow furrowed, his mood souring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Muscles? He had muscles. He even had abs, for heaven&#39;s sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why didn&#39;t she choose to admire his muscles instead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, oblivious to the silent offense, noticed Wesley&#39;s expression and sighed inwardly. He was upset again, but by now, she was accustomed to his unpredictable moods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Moss,&#34; she said quickly, &#34;how about we start with that tree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for his reply, she strode toward the tree and pressed a bright red decoration ontoits trunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the shift in her focus seemed to cool his irritation, and Wesley joined her. Soon the sprawling garden was draped in festive reds and golds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stepped back to admire their work. &#34;Much better. Now the place feels cozy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley surveyed his meticulously curated garden-where every bush and blossom usually existed in perfect harmony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the gaudy decorations clashed like cymbals in a symphony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened, but he swallowed the criticism.Loretta&#39;s orders trumped aesthetics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few hours later, the last ribbon was tied and the final ornament hung. Wesley retreated to his room,with the thought of changing out of his glaringly red clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he paused, remembering Gabriela in her own red jacket, the way it had made her eyes sparkle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, he didn&#39;t change. At the sink, he splashed water on his face, but the memory of her bright, mischievous eyes as she brushed her dirty hands across his cheek returned unbidden, making his heartbeat quicken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That silly girl...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Gabriela, having finished her tasks,could still hear Brenden&#39;s pitiful cries drifting from his training session with CassiuIs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta&#39;s brow creased. &#34;So young, yet Brenden can&#39;t get through two hours of exercise without screaming? Truly pathetic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with New Year&#39;s just around the corner,summoning Cassius again felt entirely inappropriate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief exchange, Loretta and Miriam decided to have two strong, young servants in the coming days to help Brenden with his leg stretches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even during the holidays, exercise couldn&#39;t be overlooked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their discussion concluded, and both women turned to her, their smiles warm and genuine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gabriela, you&#39;ve worked hard today. Skip lunch; you don&#39;t need to cook,&#34; Loretta told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela hesitated, about to protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as Wesley&#39;s unpaid cook, she never let her duties slide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam, however, stepped in smoothly. &#34;Mrs. Larson has another task for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s curiosity was immediately piqued. &#34;Oh?What task?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villa was fully decorated; surely there was nothing she needed to help with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta&#39;s eyes softened. &#34;Where&#39;s that scarf you were knitting last time? Let me see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, Gabriela dashed back to her room to retrieve the scarf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta and Miriam admired her handiwork, then exchanged a glance before Loretta asked, &#34;It still</p>
                
                
                
                <p>needs a little more. Why haven&#39;t you finished it yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s cheeks tinged pink. &#34;I&#39;ve... been a bit busy lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry,&#34; Loretta said with a reassuring smile.&#34;Start knitting now, and by evening, it&#39;ll be ready for sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela hesitated for a moment, unsure of Loretta&#39;s intentions-but she couldn&#39;t refuse her request.&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll do my best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Gabriela settled into her room, hands moving rhythmically over the scarf as Loretta and Miriam busied themselves in the kitchen preparing lunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As mealtime approached, Miriam slipped into the study to summon Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He entered to see a table laid with dishes, their aroma unmistakably Loretta&#39;s handiwork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t Gabriela cooking today?&#34; he asked, eyebrows slightly raised. &#34;She&#39;s got a very important task,&#34; Miriam replied, her tone deliberately cryptic. &#34;She&#39;s knitting a scarf.l heard she wants to finish it before New Year&#39;s and give it to the person who means the most to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s chest tightened, and his heart skipped a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person who means the most to Gabriela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who could that be?</p>
