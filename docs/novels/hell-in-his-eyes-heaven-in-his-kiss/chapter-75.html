                <p>Gabriela remained blissfully unaware that Phyllis was once again scheming against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While staying at Wesley&#39;s place, she felt nothing but radiant, unshakable happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the kind of money she was making on the side,she had no trouble staying cheerful al year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even better, Miriam and Loretta had finally stopped insisting she share a room with Wesley, arranging a bright, spacious guest room just for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a hot shower, she flopped onto the plush mattress, rolling across it like a carefree child,soaking in the luxury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past two nights in Wesley&#39;s bed had left her taut with unease, unable to truly savor the mansion&#39;s soft linens. Now, with the space all to herself, she felt her whole body loosen in quiet relief. Eventually, she tired from her rolling spree,grabbed her phone, and started scrolling-only to have it buzz in her hand with an incoming call from Aubrey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aubrey? Is that really you? I assumed you&#39;d be too preoccupied with your boyfriend. I&#39;m surprised you&#39;d even think to call me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela had been ready to tease Aubrey about clinging to her boyfriend, but the sharp edge in Aubrey&#39;s voice cut her short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got enough trouble as it is, and you&#39;re cracking jokes? Get on Instagram and Twitter right now-someone&#39;s dragging your name through the mud!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It turned out a high-profile Instagram influencer who went by Gem and commanded a massive following of thirty million had posted a scathing video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In it, Gem claimed Gabriela had been orphaned at eight, taken in by her uncle, and given every opportunity-financial support, a good home, even a g raduate education. Now, Gabriela was repaying that kindness by trying to snatch her uncle&#39;s house out from under him. Under her relentless pressure, her uncle began considering gifting her the property outright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if she succeeded in taking it, the video asked,what was stopping her from coming for the family business next?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The post was gaining momentum fast on Instagram-enough to stir trouble, though not yet enough to blow up into an overnight sensation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire&#39;s repost was what turned a flicker into a full-blown blaze. She added her own remark beneath it,&#34;A small favor earns gratitude, but an overly generous one often breeds resentment. In a world where good people are the ones who get hurt, this kind of behavior is chilling. Cut those ungrateful leeches out of your life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire, the undisputed queen of entertainment, had many followers. Her devoted fans quickly echoed her stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within hours, Gabriela&#39;s name had been shoved into the number-four spot on the trending chart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The post drew wave after wave of condemnation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;People like her ruin it for everyone-the good ones give up, and the real needy get left with nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s parasites like Gabriela that have sucked every last shred of kindness out of this world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The outrage swelled, and the mob&#39;s determination to track her down and publicly shame her grew fiercer by the minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within thirty minutes, someone dug up an old video from her high school days, showing her laughing with a pack of notorious delinquents at a bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, her workplace was outed, and some people claimed that they would confront her there once the holiday break ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some queried in disbelief, &#34;Isn&#39;t Apex Group the developer behind the country&#39;s most popular game?How the hell could they hire someone as pathetic as her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s pulse quickened as she scrolled. Before she could decide whether to keep reading, her phone lit up-Aubrey again. &#34;I just heard Phyllis is planning to go on Gem&#39;s livestream tomorrow to squeeze sympathy out of the audience,&#34; Aubrey warned, her voice brimming with indignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she didn&#39;t know the full story of Gabriela&#39;s family, she trusted her enough to believe she&#39;d never scheme to steal her uncle&#39;s home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Aubrey&#39;s mind, the real villain could only be that sly manipulator-Phyllis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got a friend with over three million followers-should I ask her to step in and set the record straight?&#34; Aubrey swiftly pressed on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While her friend simmered with outrage, Gabriela stayed composed, a quiet instinct telling her this could be her best moment to tip the scales in her favor. She comforted Aubrey, &#34;Don&#39;t work yourself up over it. Let&#39;s just get some rest and see where things stand in the morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why wait until morning?&#34; Aubrey&#39;s temper was teetering on the edge of explosion. &#34;Do you have any idea just how much sway Claire holds? You&#39;re already sitting at number four on the tending list-by tomorrow you&#39;ll probably be number one! How can Claire be so blind? Those lies are transparent as glass! I&#39;m disgusted I ever admired her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she was once a devoted fan of Claire,Aubrey chose to put her faith in Gabriela rather than a stranger&#39;s smear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s lips curved faintly as she assured, &#34;Relax.I&#39;ve got a plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reasoned that Claire hadn&#39;t bought the influencer&#39;s story. This was likely payback for that banquet incident with the styling team-a grudge Claire clearly hadn&#39;t let go of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s unshaken demeanor gradually eased Aubrey&#39;s temper. &#34;For real?&#34; she asked, still worried about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean it. Trust me,&#34; Gabriela replied, her tone calm and laced with quiet conviction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After years of swallowing her pride, she felt as though fate was finally sliding a weapon into her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, she needed Phyllis to fan the flames until the drama boiled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of anticipation warmed her chest as she imagined Phyllis pushing things further, the scandal would spread like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If all went perfectly, the entire internet would know by morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, Gabriela set her phone aside and settled in, ready for a full night&#39;s rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tomorrow, the counterattack would begin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even under the weight of malicious stories, she drifted into a deep, untroubled sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire, meanwhile, faced her manager&#39;s sharp rebuke for reposting on Twitter. &#34;Claire, you&#39;ve worked so hard to reach this point. One careless post from you can set the internet ablaze. Mind your words and actions before they blow up in your face!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire leaned back, utterly unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already dug into Gabriela&#39;s past and knew her high school reputation was far from spotless.This was her chance to let Wesley see the real Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The influencer&#39;s damning video was a gift-why wouldn&#39;t she make the most of it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager pressed on with gentle words of caution. &#34;Stay out of these messy disputes. They can drag you down before you realize it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waved him off with an impatient flick of her hand. &#34;Gabriela&#39;s nothing but a pest. I could crush her whenever I feel like it. And if you keep nagging, I&#39;ll skip the SK Elite Boutique endorsement altogether.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager decided it was wiser to say nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The endorsement-once well beyond Claire&#39;s grasp-had been won through backdoor ties to the CEO of the Vasquez Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The uproar online grew so deafening that even Marie caught wind of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One after another, ladies from high society called,their voices dripping with sympathy and polite concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping her tone as serene as still water, Marie offered the same line to each of them. &#34;Gabriela&#39;s a good person deep down, just a little too stubborn for her own good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They gushed over her supposed graciousness,but behind the mask, Marie&#39;s lips curled in a sharp,disdainful smile. There was nothing gracious about her intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that the matter had spiraled, she was content to sit back and watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Gabriela&#39;s reputation crumbled under this storm,she would sleep easy knowing the house and company would remain securely in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, many tossed and turned in restless sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Gabriela-the very target of those spiteful whispers-slumbered without a care and woke up feeling rested and clear-headed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, Aubrey called Gabriela again. Her voice burst through the phone, bright with surprise.&#34;Gabriela, every trending topic about you is gone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even pause before adding, &#34;No wonder you weren&#39;t panicking last night. Someone powerful must&#39;ve stepped in! I&#39;m telling you, it has to be our handsome, mighty boss backing you up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela hadn&#39;t said a word before Aubrey barreled ahead with her string of guesses. As Aubrey&#39;s rapid-fire chatter finally tapered off, a thought began to settle in Gabriela&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who else could wipe every trace of those trending topics in a single night? It could only be Wesley&#39;s doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, she descended the stairs in search of him-only to spot Billy making his way toward the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lingered a moment, then followed at a measured pace.</p>
