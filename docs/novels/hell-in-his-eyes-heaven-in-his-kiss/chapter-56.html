                <p>Phyllis faltered under the weight of Gabriela&#39;s unblinking stare, a twinge of unease threading through her simmering anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no doubt that Gabriela would make good on her threat and drag them both into hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m perfectly happy with Dustin. We&#39;re getting married tomorrow-why on earth would I waste my time provoking you? Get over yourself,&#34; Phyllis snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she spun on her heel, retreating to her bedroom in a huff. She threw herself onto the bed,willing her pulse to settle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted a good night&#39;s sleep, hoping she would look breathtaking for Dustin the next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the door clicked shut behind her, Gabriela felt a heaviness settle over her. The confrontation left her utterly drained, not from fear but from years of enduring the same weary cycle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since high school, she&#39;d stopped counting on Marie or Josh, clawing her way through every exam and tuition payment alone. She&#39;d earned her degrees,carved out her career, and now stayed rooted in this place for one reason only-because she wasn&#39;t leaving without reclaiming the house that had been stolen from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her mother&#39;s hard-built business fall into the hands of people she loathed was a humiliation Gabriela refused to swallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh might have promised to give the house back,but she knew Marie would guard it like a rabid dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And freeing her mother&#39;s burial plot from Marie&#39;s grasp-so her mother could truly rest-was another battle she had to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To accomplish all of that, she needed two things:money and the right allies. She swore to work harder than ever, chasing every opportunity until she had both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But money took time to build, and tomorrow demanded her attention first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of Phyllis&#39;s smug little smirk made her want to show up dazzling, steal the spotlight, and watch that arrogance crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d already chosen her weapon: the gown she&#39;d kept after attending a banquet with Wesley that night -a dress that had turned heads before, and would again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she reached for the gown to take it out for a fitting, her gaze drifted to an ornate box resting on the side table. Wesley had mentioned it earlier,saying it was a return gift from Brenden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Gabriela had little interest in anything from Brenden,curiosity nudged her to lift the lid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside lay a pristine white dress, paired with a necklace featuring a single ruby teardrop that glimmered faintly in the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A matching bracelet rested beside it, its fine craftsmanship hinting at a steep price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dress lacked the extravagant flair of the one from SK Elite Boutique, yet Gabriela decided to slip it on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Its design was clean and understated, but when she saw her reflection, she was taken aback-the fabric draped over her with an effortless grace, exuding a quiet,refined luxury she hadn&#39;t expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela couldn&#39;t help but be impressed by Brenden&#39;s surprisingly refined taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even more unexpectedly, he had remembered to prepare a thick coat for her this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she&#39;d changed, her gaze lingered on the bracelet clasped around her wrist. After a moment&#39;s thought, she decided against wearing the new one from the gift box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she composed a courteous message to &#34;NotASaunders.&#34; &#34;Thanks for gifting me this gorgeous dress, Mr. Saunders. The wedding begins at 5:30 PM tomorrow at the Deluxe Hotel. Can you get there on time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her message vanished into the chat without a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s certainty faltered. Brenden was unpredictable at the best of times-would he even bother showing up tomorrow?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Playing it safe, she logged into a rent-a-date site,wired over a three-thousand-dollar deposit,and booked a strikingly handsome young man who seemed like a reliable choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After picking up a tailored suit for Brenden, she was left with barely six thousand in her account.Watching her savings dwindle by half again made her chest tighten with regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the house buzzed with noise as Josh and Marie returned, brimming with cheer while putting the final touches on the wedding preparations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, Gabriela had been smart enough to reserve a hotel room. She told Josh she had work to wrap up and slipped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marie shother retreating figure a frosty glance and muttered, &#34;Phyllis&#39;s wedding is tomorrow, and Gabriela can&#39;t be bothered to help at all-just how ungrateful can she be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s thoughts drifted back to the heated fight between Gabriela and Phyllis, replaying each accusation Gabriela had thrown. He parted his lips to speak, but shut them again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still couldn&#39;t say who was truly in the right. It was better to keep the two of them apart than risk another blow-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Gabriela let go of her worries and slept more peacefully than she had in days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she stired the next morning, the sunlight was already streaming across the room. Her energy felt completely renewed, the sparkle back in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing it was already noon, she rushed through her wash-up, smoothing her hair and freshening her makeup until she looked effortlessly polished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden knock broke the quiet. &#34;Miss Haynes,the styling team you booked is here. Should I send them in?&#34; a hotel attendant called through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela blinked, momentarily thrown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night, she&#39;d chosen the cheapest single room they had-just eighty dollars a night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet somehow, the staff had upgraded her to the penthouse suite, claiming the first ten new guests each day received complimentary premium service.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had thought it odd at the time, but now the situation felt downright suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the stylists swept inside, arms laden with cases of cosmetics, the scene felt almost unreal. They were the very team responsible for Claire-the reigning goddess of the entertainment industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At their head stood Annie Wright, her warm smile lighting up the room. &#34;Well, Miss Haynes... looks like fate&#39;s brought us together again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After exchanging pleasantries, Gabriela let Annie and her team get to work, still a little dazed by the turn of events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For more than two hours, the stylists moved around her in a flurry of quiet efficiency before finally helping her into the white gown and fastening the ruby pendant at her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the soft lighting, she looked even more breathtaking than she had on the night of the banquet, and Annie couldn&#39;t help showering her wvith praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came time to slip on the matching bracelet,Gabriela shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annie tilted her head, curiosity flickering in her eyes Gabriela brushed it off with a flimsy excuse.&#34;I&#39;ll have a coat on anyway, so no one will even see the bracelet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She certainly couldn&#39;t admit that she didn&#39;t want to take off the plain, unassuming bracelet already on her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annie let the matter drop. &#34;WVell, there&#39;s a natural elegance to your wrists. This bracelet may be simple,but on you, it looks effortlessly stylish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The compliment warmed Gabriela more than she expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been faintly annoyed that Wesley&#39;s year-end gift had been nothing more than an unremarkable bracelet, yet hearing genuine admiration for it stirred an unexpected flicker of joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annie kept her own observation to herself-that the ruby pendant at Gabriela&#39;s throat was worth millions and would outshine everything in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether or not Gabriela wore the bracelet was irrelevant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the makeover was done, Gabriela saw the team off,headed downstairs for a quick meal, and pulled out her phone to message Brenden, asking when he&#39;d be there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reply still hadn&#39;t come, yet an unexpected calm settled over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had arranged for the styling team to be here,he surely would show up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And even if he wouldn&#39;t, she had a contingency ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hair was styled into a chic, effortless updo that lent a fresh, youthful air to her poised elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she stepped out of the car, a ripple of surprise passed through the onlookers-several failed to recognize her at first and leaned toward one another in hushed speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is she? She&#39;s breathtakingly gorgeous. Did the Haynes family hire a celebrity guest?&#34; &#34;No clue. We&#39;ll find out soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without so much as a glance at the murmuring crowd, Gabriela glided toward the entrance of the Deluxe Hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh had taken over the entire venue, and a gleaming row of luxury cars lined the driveway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the doors stood a towering wedding portrait of Phyllis and Dustin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The couple were stationed at the entrance, smiling as they welcomed arriving guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment Gabriela neared, Dustin&#39;s eyes locked on her, and his confident grin faltered,the smugness slipping from his face.</p>
