                <p>The workday finally ended, and Gabriela followed Aubrey out of the building, the weight of the luxurious gift box tucked under her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey&#39;s endless curiositybubbled over as they walked, peppering Gabriela with questions about her so-called boyfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat crept up Gabriela&#39;s cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Brenden even her boyfriend? He was a notorious flirt, not exactly boyfriend material. All they were doing was scratching each other&#39;s backs. The only reason he&#39;d sent that extravagant SK Elite Boutique dress was because he needed her to play the perfect date at some fancy banquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing Gabriela wasn&#39;t in the mood to share,Aubrey let the topic drop, though her eyes still gleamed with mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They reached the bus stop and settled in to wait.Suddenly, a bright red BMW slid up to the curb with a showy squeal, horn blaring in rapid bursts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both women turned, startled, just as the tinted window slid down. Phyllis lounged in the passenger seat, her smile bright and insincerely sweet. &#34;Are you on your way home,Gabriela? | can give you a ride.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Gabriela could respond, Phyllis gave a theatrical little gasp and pressed a hand to her chest.&#34;Oh, silly me! With your new wealthy boyfriend, I&#39;m sure regular cars aren&#39;t good enough for you anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela barely spared her a glance, lips pressed in a thin,unimpressed line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Gabriela&#39;s chilly silence, Phyllis&#39;s grin only sharpened. Clearly convinced Gabriela was bluffing about her boyfriend, she pressed harder. &#34;If your boyfriend&#39;s so loaded,why isn&#39;t he here picking you up?Why are you standing around waiting for a bus?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s voice was flat and steady as she answered,&#34;He&#39;s got work. He&#39;s busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis let out a smug little laugh. &#34;Naturally-men that important must have a million people to meet every day. I guess there&#39;s no time left for his girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she finished, Phyllis angled herself so Gabriela and Aubrey had an unobstructed view of Dustin behind the wheel. &#34;Not like Dustin. He always drops everything just to pick me up after work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dustin&#39;s grip tightened on the steering wheel the moment he spotted the SK Elite Boutique box in Gabriela&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stood quietly beside Aubrey, her beauty impossible to ignore-velvety skin, legs impossibly long, the kind of looks that made strangers stare. She could have stepped right off the pages of a fairytale Even after their breakup, Dustin couldn&#39;t shake the old feelings. Some part of him still wanted her-resentful as he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Gabriela appeared to have moved on from him.She had barely ended things before flaunting a new boyfriend, and if Phyllis was right, this guy was rich-probably middle-aged,maybe even older.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of young billionaire handed out gifts worth a small fortune just for fun?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Dustin mulled it over, the more bitter he became.He shot Phyllis a sidelong glance, voice laced with contempt. &#34;She doesn&#39;t even appreciate it.You&#39;re wasting your energy picking her up. Seriously,you&#39;re way too soft. Just let her fend for herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dustin&#39;s sneer only made Phyllis feel more pleased with herself, though she managed to mask it with a syrupy apology. &#34;Oh, Gabriela, don&#39;t mind Dustin. He&#39;s just brutally honest. He doesn&#39;t mean anything by it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela didn&#39;t so much as blink. &#34;It&#39;s fine. When someone&#39;s working with such a tiny processor upstairs,it&#39;s only natural that whatever he says bypasses his brain entirely. Why would I waste my energy arguing with someone like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey also leapt to Gabriela&#39;s defense. &#34;That&#39;s right!Honestly, you two are a match made in heaven-one struts around like royalty, and the other cruises in a screaming-red BMW like it&#39;s a trophy. But here&#39;s the thing-Gabriela&#39;s SK Elite Boutique dress probably costs more than three times the price of your car. lf you&#39;re here to put on a show, you&#39;re just making fools of yourselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey&#39;s barbs hit harder than Gabriela&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s face went ashen, and Dustin&#39;s jaw clenched in rage. &#34;Gabriela, I can&#39;t believe you&#39;ve turned into such a bitter, petty person-and your friend is just as vain as you. I&#39;m really disappointed in you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wrapped an arm around Phyllis and pulled away,leaving the sting of his words behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey blinked in disbelief, momentarily caught off guard and speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, your cousin&#39;s something else, Gabriela. So,that guy she is with-he&#39;s actually your ex? Were you always this bad at picking men, or did dating that clown scramble your standards?&#34; A sudden heaviness pressed on Gabriela&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had she ever fallen for someone like Dustin She&#39;d tried a hundred times to untangle the reasor but every attempt just made her mood worse-so thi time,she let it go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Gabriela&#39;s mood suddenly drop, Aubrey waste no time to cheer her up. &#34;Ugh, who cares about tha loser? You&#39;ve totally leveled up. Let&#39;s just forge about him and focus on the real win-SK Elite Boutique! That&#39;s what I want to talk about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dove right in, regaling Gabriela with animatec stories about the boutique&#39;s wild popularity, anc insisted she take a million photos at the banquet to share later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bus rumbled up to the curb. After a round of cheerful waves, Gabriela boarded, swept into the evening rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she made it home, the house was quiet-no sign of Phyllis. Instead, she found Josh pacing the living room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second he spotted her, he hurried over. &#34;Gabriela How could you suddenly leave and head back to work while you were on a blind date? And you didn&#39;t come home or pick up your phone all night! Rhys was furious.Phyllis claimed he complained about you a lot after coming home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela steadied herself, then announced, &#34;Uncle Josh,I have a boyfriend now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh stood there, momentarily stunned, his mouth opening and closing as if searching for words. Then he snapped back to life, rattling off questions, &#34;What&#39;s his name? What kind of work does he do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just yesterday she&#39;d been fussing about a blind date,and now she suddenly had a boyfriend? Was she just making up storiesto dodge the whole thing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela calmly replied, &#34;I&#39;ll bring him to Phyllis&#39;s wedding. You&#39;ll get to meet him yourself then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That seemed to finally put Josh&#39;s suspicions at ease -at least for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she&#39;d escaped his interrogation,Gabriela slipped away to her room and lifted the lid of the gift box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how many times Aubrey had warned her about SK Elite Boutique&#39;s jaw-dropping prices,Gabriela was still stunned when she finally saw the dress up close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gown was a breathtaking shade of deep blue,falling to her knees, with rows of tiny, real diamonds glittering around the hem. Wearing it was like being draped in a patch of sunlight sparkling on the ocean. She might not know much about designer labels, but even she could tell this dress cost an outrageous fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jittery thrill swept over her, quickly edged out by a prickle of anxiety she couldn&#39;t quite shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she slipped into the dress, Gabriela hesitated for a moment, then reached out to &#34;NotASaunders&#34; with a text. &#34;Mr. Saunders, it&#39;s just a banquet. Did you really have to go all out on a dress like this?&#34;</p>
