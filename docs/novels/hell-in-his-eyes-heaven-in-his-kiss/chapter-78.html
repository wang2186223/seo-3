                <p>Aubrey was seething with anger, unleashing a torrent of curses at Phyllis and her whole family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Phyllis&#39; cousin, Gabriela felt unfairly pulled into the conflict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To calm Aubrey&#39;s escalating fury, Gabriela shared the two videos she had recorded earlier that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after,Aubrey fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, after watching the videos, she called Gabriela,her tone brimming with enthusiasm. &#34;Gabriela, you&#39;re incredible! How did you get these videos? Why didn&#39;t you tell me sooner? I was so stressed out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela offered a weary smile. &#34;I&#39;ve always said there&#39;s no need to panic or lose your temper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you were just trying to make me feel better,&#34; Aubrey admitted. Then she proposed,&#34;Should I get my friend with three million followers to share the video now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela responded calmly, &#34;No need to rush. Let&#39;s hold off for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll follow your lead this time!&#34; Aubrey agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After diffusing Aubrey&#39;s anger, Gabriela leaned against her seat, feeling exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Billy, who was driving, stole subtle glances at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All morning, Gabriela had seemed unlike her usual vibrant, cheerful self. Today she was unusually quiet,yet there was a newfound calmness about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if the confident, carefree persona she usually projected was a carefully constructed mask.Beneath it, she seemed to be patiently biding her time, waiting for an opportunity to escape the chaos surrounding her. Billy was struck by this realization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was such a kind,genuine person, yet she was forced to endure such distressing circumstances. It felt profoundly unfair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He silently hoped that Wesley would always be kind to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eager to return to the Moss Manor and update Wesley on the situation, he was interrupted by a call from Wesley while still on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It turned out Phyllis had gone live online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Vivian had been stirring up trouble all night.When a well-known celebrity like Claire shared their video, the drama quickly made it onto the trending lists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis was thrilled, reveling in the attention and unable to sleep from the excitement. But by morning,all the trending topics related to Gabriela had vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marie warned Phyllis, &#34;You failed to take Gabriela down completely, so stop now. I&#39;ll clean up this mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis,however, refused to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after the trending topics were removed, the post continued to gain traction across various platforms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unwilling to let go of her vendetta, Phyllis secretly met with Vivian and that influencer, Gem, to plan a live stream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At 2 p.m., Gem appeared on the live stream,her face heavily made-up and enhanced by beauty filters,giving her an almost artificial, doll-like appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the stream began, her followers flooded the chat with greetings and crude questions about Gabriela&#39;s situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gem introduced Phyllis, who looked strikingly beautiful with subtle makeup, further refined by the stream&#39;s filters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audience buzzed with curiosity about her identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis introduced herself and launched into a carefully rehearsed speech.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She claimed Gabriela, whom her family had raised,was vain, ill-tempered, and rebellious, constantly borrowing her clothes and jewelry without permission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Gabriela grew older, she used her looks to hang out with unsavory characters at bars. After starting her career, she set her sights on taking her uuncle&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worse, Phyllis accused Gabriela of trying to seduce her newlywed husband, who had been Gabriela&#39;s schoolmate and someone she admired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis delivered her accusations with a soft, weary tone, appearing polite and fragile, which quickly won over the sympathy of viewers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment section exploded with support for her and bitter criticism against Gabriela. &#34;Stay strong, Phyllis! Millions of us have your back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gabriela is so disgusting. What a despicable person!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you encounter someone this awful, you cut them out of your life so they can&#39;t hurt you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Phyllis&#39;s parents even helped Gabriela get through college, and this is how she is repaid? Unbelievable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen was soonflooded with hateful remarks directed at Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gabriela should go to hell!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bitch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Utterly repulsive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shameless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley, who had tasked Billy with monitoring the situation, was also keeping a close eye on the online developments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the overwhelming wave of malice and insults aimed at Gabriela, Wesley&#39;s expression darkened. He immediately ordered Billy to contact a top PR expert,sparing no expense to reverse the tide of public opinion as quickly as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy, still driving, pulled over to the side of the road and explained, &#34;I&#39;m about half an hour from the estate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s impatience was palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He trusted Billy above all his other capable assistants and wouldn&#39;t feel confident entrusting this task to anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overhearing the conversation, Gabriela spoke up softly.&#34;Let me talk to Mr. Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took Billy&#39;s phone and, in a calm tone,reassured Wesley, &#34;I&#39;m fine, Mr. Moss. You don&#39;t need to worry about this. I can handle it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a personal matter between her and Phyllis,and Gabriela was determined to resolve it on her own terms. Wesley&#39;s brow remained furrowed. &#34;Are you sure you&#39;re okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most women would be devastated by such an onslaught, and Gabriela&#39;s composure took him by surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her insistence on handling it herself left him feeling sidelined and displeased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; Gabriela assured him. &#34;But I do have one small favor to ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s mood lifted slightly. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was hoping you could advance my salary,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the current online buzz was significant,Gabriela worried that Aubrey&#39;s friend with three million followers might not generate enough attention, and she might need to hire paid promoters to amplify her response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s face soured instantly. Why was she begging for money while her reputation was in tatters?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed,&#34;Fine.How much do you need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He half-jokingly thought he might as well advance her salary for years to come, tying her to Apex Group indefinitely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela named the amount she needed, and after their discussion, she handed the phone back to Billy and checked her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unknown number was calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered, only to be met with a middle-aged man&#39;s voice, dripping with malice. &#34;You&#39;re Gabriela,right? Listen, you&#39;re an absolute disgrace. Your workplace address is out there now-brace yourself for what is coming. Go to hell,you worthless trash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were venomous, laced with vile intent,as if the caller wanted to destroy her through the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela calmly ended the call and switched her phone to silent. Her number had been leaked online, and a flood of harassing calls and messages filled with hateful,repulsive language followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her mental preparation, the intensity of it all still caught her off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She texted Aubrey, &#34;Time to post those two videos.Please thank your friend for helping out. I owe her a meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey, eager to expose Phyllis&#39;s true colors, replied with enthusiasm, &#34;No problem. Let&#39;s take Phyllis down!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the live stream, Phyllis noticed dozens of missed calls from Marie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She called back casually. &#34;Mom...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could continue, Marie cut her off sharply.&#34;Go back online now and clarify that everything you said was a misunderstanding. Gabriela didn&#39;t steal our house-it was hers to begin with.&#34; Phyllis&#39;s face darkened.&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she had earlier unveiled her so-called truth,the online crowd rallied behind her, unleashing a barrage of insults at Gabriela far more venomous and degrading than she had anticipated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was branded as trash, a nuisance, while she was elevated as the epitome of innocence and virtue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having invested so much effort in fueling this controversy, why would she now step in to defend Gabriela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, you&#39;re the one who always said-if you want something, you seize it, no matter what it takes,&#34;Phyllis declared. &#34;Now that Gabriela is a public target, open to everyone&#39;s attacks, why should I show her any mercy?&#34;</p>
