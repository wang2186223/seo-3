                <p>Loretta&#39;s vision dimmed, and for a moment she thought she might collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rumor was absurd-utterly impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These people are talking rubbish!&#34; she burst out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam, spotting her agitation, leaned in with calculated gravity. &#34;Do you remember that fortunate teller you brought in last time? The one who warned something bad would happen to Mr. Moss before year&#39;s end?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta nodded. &#34;Oh, yes-it sounded dreadful!Thank goodness I paid for those protective rites.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you ask me, Gabriela is the one who warded it off,&#34;Miriam continued, each word deliberate. &#34;When she arrived last night, she was so badly hurt she couldn&#39;t even stand. Mr. Moss carried her all the way inside  himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could a delicate young woman like Gabriela truly shield Wesley from ill fortune?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought hovered in Loretta&#39;s mind, impossible yet strangely compelling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam carried on weaving her story. &#34;See how her cheekbones slope gently instead ofjutting out? That softness means good fortune. And the radiant, joyful energy that follows her? Every sign points to a woman born under a lucky star.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta drew in a quick breath. &#34;I was so taken with her beauty, I didn&#39;t even notice these.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam said firmly, &#34;Believe me, any man who wins her hand would be walking away with the prize of a lifetime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I judged her wrong,&#34; Loretta admitted at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam&#39;s tone softened. &#34;It&#39;s fine. There are still ways we can... encourage developments between Mr.Moss and her.&#34; Leaning closer, she murmured a scheme into Loretta&#39;s ear, &#34;When he turns in tonight,we&#39;ll do this...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta faltered. &#34;Are you sure that will work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always enjoyed her conversations with Miriam,trusting the housekeeper without question-perhaps because of those warm, kind eyes and her steady, gentle manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Gabriela was another matter entirely, and Loretta&#39;s unfamiliarity bred caution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam pressed on. &#34;For now, we need to keep Gabriela here. Mr. Moss upset Gabriela last night,and the thought of staying another night likely unsettles her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta gave a small nod. &#34;Alright, we&#39;ll do as you say. I&#39;ll figure out a way to make her stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, despite her injured foot, had carried out her tasks with quiet patience, never once complaining.That gentle, agreeable nature had won Loretta&#39;s favor. Now she far preferred Gabriela to Fiona, whose  spoiled delicacy grated in comparison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When their private discussion ended, Loretta and Miriam returned to the living room, where Gabriela sat waiting with a calm composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She began, &#34;My foot&#39;s feeling much better. My uncle called earlier and asked me to come home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, whatever hesitation Loretta still harbored vanished in an instant. She leaned forward, her tone almost urgent. &#34;Leaving already? Is something bothering you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, puzzled by the sudden warmth in Loretta&#39;s manner, answered politely, &#34;Mr. Moss was kind enough to take me in last night, and I&#39;d hate to impose any further.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam leaned in with a warm smile. &#34;It&#39;s no trouble at all. The manor&#39;s big enough to spare a room for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela gave an awkward smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the room they meant was Wesley&#39;s own bedroom. Catching the flicker of hesitation in her eyes, Loretta felt a pang of shame. Only last night she&#39;d been convinced Gabriela had no self-respect,that she was chasing after money and would latch onto her grandson without a shred of dignity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gabriela, are you angry at me for giving you a hard time earlier?&#34; she asked gently, Gabriela shook her head quickly. &#34;Not at all. My uncle&#39;sasking me to come home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With that injured foot of yours, how are you even planning to get there? Stay another night,and leave tomorrow once you&#39;ve had more rèst.&#34; Loretta&#39;s eyes grew misty with theatrical sorrow. &#34;If you walk out now, it&#39;s as good as saying you are upset with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Loretta&#39;s voice brimming with earnestness,Gabriela felt cornered into agreeing. &#34;Fine, I&#39;ll give it one more night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam exhaled in quiet relief, instantly heading to the kitchen to arrange dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing she&#39;d be staying, Gabriela pulled out her phone to call her uncle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spoke softly into the phone. &#34;Yes, I&#39;m not coming back tonight. My ankle&#39;s still sore, so I&#39;ll stay over at a friend&#39;s place... No, it&#39;s nothing serious-no need for the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the side, Loretta observed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley had said Gabriela had been locked out late at night, yet here she was, still speaking to her uncle with such unshakable respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela truly seemed a rare find.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta&#39;s affection for her deepened-after all, here was a young woman who treated everyone with genuine respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, however, felt a prickle of unease beneath Loretta&#39;s suddenly adoring gaze, sensing an odd shift in her demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>·.·</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dinner was soon served, drawing everyone to the long,gleaming table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta&#39;s gaze sharpened when she noticed how closely Gabriela attended to Wesley&#39;s tastes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When a platter of spicy shredded vegetables landed near him, Gabriela leaned in and murmured, &#34;Mr.Moss, maybe go easy on this one. Or I can take out the chilies for you-how about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his secretary, she knew his preferences by heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley couldn&#39;t handle too much heat because of his heart, yet he still craved the faint burn of spice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a quiet &#34;Okay,&#34; and though his face remained composed, the faint curl at the edge of his lips betrayed the lift in his mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta found the change in him astonishing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grandson had always been stubborn, brushing off nearly everyone&#39;s advice-yet Gabriela could move him without effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cast a sidelong glance at Miriam, who met her gaze with a serene smile that wordlessly said, &#34;Told you she was remarkable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once dinner was cleared away, Loretta and Miriam drew Gabriela into a round of cards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter and lighthearted banter carried them past ten o&#39;clock, until at last they let her slip away to her room for the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela climbed the stairs, her gaze sweeping over the sprawling master bedroom with quiet reluctance.&#34;Miriam, would it be alright if I stayed in a guest room tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With practiced ease, Miriam offered a smooth excuse. &#34;We ended up playing so late there wasn&#39;t time to ready one. Just spend another night here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint discomfort prickled at Gabriela. &#34;And...what about Mr.Moss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta cut in before Miriam could speak. &#34;He can keep sleeping in the study.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela found it a bit improper, yet Miriam gave her a gentle push through the doorway. &#34;That&#39;s settled-Loretta and I are far too old to be staying up late.Good night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she was nudged into Wesley&#39;s bedroom,Miriam and Loretta made their way toward the study to track down Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had just stepped out of the shower, a faint curl of steam clinging to him as he worked a blow dryer through his damp hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he spotted Loretta and Miriam entering together, a ripple of unease crossed his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma, Miriam-what brings you both here?&#34;</p>
