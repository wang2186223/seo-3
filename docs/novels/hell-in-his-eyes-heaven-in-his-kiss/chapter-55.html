                <p>The day before the wedding, just as Gabriela had expected, Phyllis flooded the classmates&#39; group chat with a parade of photos-herself beaming in a pristine white wedding gown, a ring boasting a walnut-sized diamond glittering on her finger as she clung tightly to Dustin&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a group of high school alumni, and Gabriela-added for reasons she stil didn&#39;t understand-had barely typed a word since joining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for the constant pings announcing Phyllis&#39;s photos, she wouldn&#39;t have noticed this group chat at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations! May your marriage be blissful,Phyllis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That wedding dress is gorgeous, Phyllis-and your fiancé is incredibly handsome.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two are such a heavenly pair-talented,beautiful, and made for each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Originally, their idle chatter had nothing to do with Gabriela-until Phyllis deliberately tagged her and slipped in a few sly jabs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come to think of it, I really owe my thanks to my cousin Gabriela. Without her, I never would&#39;ve met such an outstanding man like Dustin... and now, he&#39;s the love of my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The classmates were-confused by the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, your fiancé was introduced by Gabriela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Phyllis, you&#39;re not concerned about Gabriela making a play for your fiancé?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis let her words drip with insinuation. &#34;Well,truth be told, Gabriela did have a little thing for Dustin.I mean, who wouldn&#39;t? He&#39;s got it all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group&#39;s chat quickly turned into a gossip frenzy. &#34;Sounds like she&#39;s after your man, Phyllis. Better keep an eye on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis played the gracious act in her reply.&#34;She probably couldn&#39;t control herself. I&#39;m fine with it,really. But Dustin might not be so at ease.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all it took for the others to jump in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course he&#39;s irritated. Gabriela must be bothering him nonstop-anyone would lose patience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. Back in high school, Gabriela was always trying to cozy up to other girls&#39; boyfriends. Guess some habits never die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela read each message with a blank expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of it surprised her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis had always delighted in making her life difficult-grabbing what belonged to her and even stealing the man she once cared for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Phyllis had everything she ever wanted,she still went out of her way to relentlessly provoke Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, Gabriela had long since let go of Dustin,her heart no longer tangled up in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she still cared, this public jab might have driven her to hide under the covers in tears. Then her swollen eyes would give Phyllis and her friends fresh amusement to gossip over at the wedding tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela simply refused to give them the reaction they wanted, acting as if she hadn&#39;t noticed a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, Vivian chimed in, tagging Gabriela yet again, &#34;Phyllis, Gabriela&#39;s been secretly longing for Dustin day after day. You&#39;re practically a saint for still thanking her and speaking kindly of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s dig sparked immediate agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember Gabriela being pretty wild back in school-ditching class just to flirt with guys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s got that dangerous charm-definitely not someone with clean intentions. Phyllis, I&#39;d watch my back if I were you.&#34; Phyllis&#39;s words breezed through the chat. &#34;Gabriela&#39;s got a boyfriend now, so don&#39;t get the wrong idea.She even promised to bring him to my wedding. From what I&#39;ve heard, he&#39;s quite a catch-sounds like she&#39;s moved on from Dustin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s friends were quick to pile on, tossing out snide guesses about what kind of man Gabriela could possibly land.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Probably one of those shady gang types.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe a spoiled rich boy with a string of girlfriends waiting in line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re giving her too much credit. I&#39;m betting he&#39;s old, ugly, and she&#39;s just the side piece. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the real wife storms in one day to put her in her damn place. Ha!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stayed silent, which only fueled their cruelty.Their words grew sharper, more brazen, feeding off each other&#39;s scorn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in high school, more than half the class had delighted in tearing her down.It was a long-ingrained contempt-a belief that Gabriela was born to be despised, someone anyone could walk over without consequence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A handful of classmates who&#39;d stayed quiet until now finally spoke up, telling the others not to cross the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve never laid eyes on Gabriela doing any of that yourself. What if it&#39;s all just false rumors?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, please-what, are you in love with Gabriela?That&#39;s the only reason you&#39;d defend her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone who dared take Gabriela&#39;s side was quickly drowned out, their words dismissed before they could gain any traction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voices left dominating the chat belonged entirely to those who loathed her, and their attacks grew even more vicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disgust twisted in Gabriela&#39;s gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t fathom why they clung to such spite, especially when she&#39;d never done a thing to harm them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, she didn&#39;t hold back. Her fingers flew over the keyboard, each keystroke sharp with rage. &#34;What the hell is wrong with you people? Every time you run your mouths, nothing but garbage comes out.Your heads are in the gutter, so of course you see dirt in everything around you-yet you still strut around like you&#39;re better than everyone else. Honestly, I feel sorry for your parents for raising such pathetic,worthless trash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for replies, she left the group entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Switching to her private conversation with Phyllis,she sent her an audio clip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gabriela, from what I hear, your company&#39;s crawling with single guys. They may not measure up to Dustin,but they&#39;re enough for you. Just find anyone who&#39;s halfway decent and call it a day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those had been Phyllis&#39;s smug words earlier, tossed out while she flashed her diamond ring-a jab meant to sting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Gabriela forwarded a video from Grace Robuchon, capturing the moment Phyllis and her friends had falsely accused her of theft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She followed it with a short text. &#34;Don&#39;t you dare bother me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely had the message gone through when a sharp knock sounded on her door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela opened it to find Phyllis standing there, her expression twisted with hostility. &#34;What the hell do you want?&#34; she asked, her voice cool as ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s glare burned with pure spite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s beauty had always been a thorn in Phyllis&#39;s side-a constant reminder of everything she couldn&#39;t outshine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already stripped Gabriela of her home,her elegant dresses, her delicate hairpins. She had smeared her reputation beyond repair,and stolen her boyfriend. Yet the envy still burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela had been torn down to nothing. Yet somehow,she had clawed her way back. Why wasn&#39;t she drowning in shame, scraping by on scraps and other people&#39;s pity?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she had walked into a top-tier university,stepped into Apex Group, and landed as Wesley&#39;s secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An orphan, living like she belonged to the glamorous world Phyllis could barely touch-how the hell was that possible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And those eyes-how could they still burn so brightly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The longer Phyllis stared, the more her rage curdled,her nails digging crescents into her palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly were you trying to say by sending those?&#34; she demanded sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s gaze was steady, her voice low and dangerous. &#34;Push me again, and I&#39;ll make sure your wedding guests get a front-row seat to the real you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s smile vanished, her tone turning sharp as glass. &#34;You wouldn&#39;t dare. Remember-your dead mother only gets to rest quietly in the ground because my mother pays for her grave every year.Mess with me, and I&#39;ll see to it your late mother&#39;s peace gets ripped to shreds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words sliced into Gabriela&#39;s chest, freezing her breath. Her gaze darkened, voice low and unyielding.&#34;Leave me be, and I&#39;ll leave you alone. Piss me off,and we&#39;ll both go straight to hell together,you got that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother was the one line she refused to let anyone cross. If anyone so much as brushed against that boundary, she&#39;d strike back without hesitation-even if it meant destroying herself in the process.</p>
