                <p>Curiosity surged as colleagues scrambled to verify the claim online, and within moments, they found the listing-complete with a photo of the deliveryman himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of gasps and excitement rippled through the office. &#34;Holy crap, it&#39;s legit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way-let me see that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It matches exactly! That&#39;s the same dress. SK Elite Boutique,for real!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The buzz swelled, voices overlapping in a rush of disbelief and envy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,color drained from Phyllis&#39;s face,leaving her exposed and speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d never expected the dress to be genuine, let alone straight from SK Elite Boutique.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela-the person she&#39;d belittled all her life, the one from whom she&#39;d stolen a boyfriend-somehow owned a dress from SK Elite Boutique that even she couldn&#39;t afford. How was that even possible? Of course Gabriela could never afford a dress like that. Not in a million years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given her limited finances, there was no way Gabriela had the means to purchase it herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis, after a beat, forced an apologetic smile. &#34;Oh,Gabriela, I must&#39;ve jumped to conclusions. I had no idea. SK Elite Boutique dresses cost a fortune.Just getting the chance to buy one is practically impossible I really didn&#39;t think you could get your hands on something like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey, fed up with Phyllis&#39;s thinly veiled barbs, shot her a glare. &#34;Maybe it was a gift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s eyes narrowed, but her lips curled into a sly smile. &#34;A gift? Who on earth would give away something so extravagant? Unless, of course...&#34; She covered her mouth with exaggerated surprise.&#34;Gabriela, don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve got yourself a boyfriend now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, who&#39;d been convinced the dress was a delivery mistake, only caught on when she heard someone Phyllis&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was right-she&#39;d promised Brenden, just this morning,she would be his date for the banquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this jaw-dropping dress actually be from him? All day she&#39;d fretted about how to afford a breathtaking dress, but apparently, Brenden had already solved that problem without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did have a reputation for spoiling women, but Gabriela had never experienced it herself-until now,with this extravagant surprise landing squarely in her lap after a one-night stand. So this was what it felt like to be truly doted on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recalling how Brenden had agreed to play her boyfriend, Gabriela faced the crowd with steady poise and confirmed, &#34;Yes. I have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s eyes flashed green. Unable to keep the bite from her voice, she sneered, &#34;Wow,your boyfriend must be rolling in it if he&#39;s buying you designer dresses like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela flashed Phyllis a smug smile and shot back,&#34;What can I say? He likes to spoil me-and at least he&#39;s not living off someone else&#39;s dime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s jaw clenched, the sting of Gabriela&#39;s jab unmistakable. She knew perfectly well Gabriela was talking about Dustin, but there wasn&#39;t a single retort she could throw back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was true-Dustin&#39;s family had always struggled; he worked for Haynes Group, depending on her family&#39;s wealth to get by But that was perfectly fine. Dustin was good-looking,carried himself with confidence, and had a prestigious degree under his belt. He&#39;d graduated a year before Gabriela and already knocked out a master&#39;s degree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marie never missed a chance to praise Dustin&#39;s ambition and potential.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And most importantly, Dustin was the prize Phyllis had stolen from Gabriela. Victory always tasted that much sweeter when you&#39;d ripped it right out of someone else&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela,freshly dumped by Dustin, had somehow managed to land herself an even more extravagant boyfriend-how on earth? She seemed to have sunk her claws into some gaudy, deep-pocketed sugar daddy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Imagining that Gabriela had become the lover of a wealthy but distasteful and lecherous older man,Phyllis felt secretly pleased, a poised smile returning to her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Gabriela, voice syrupy sweet. &#34;I&#39;m getting married next month, Gabriela. You have to bring your boyfriend. We&#39;ve already set aside the bridesmaid and groomsman spots just for you two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curled with a hint of malice as she went on,&#34;The groomsman does have to be single, though Does your boyfriend meet the requirements?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Absolutely.&#34; She caught the mischief gleaming in Phyllis&#39;s eyes, but she wasn&#39;t fazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden might have a reputation as a player, but his looks and his background made Dustin look positively ordinary-a true standout, even if he wasn&#39;t quite in the same league as someone like Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s lips curved into a confident smile. &#34;Trust me,he&#39;ll fit right in. My only concern is that he might outshine your groom and steal all the attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis eyed her skeptically, refusing to buy into the act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unattractive, loaded sugar daddy crashing the groom&#39;s spotlight? There was no way that could happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dustin, for all his flaws,had movie-star looks-there was no denying it. If anyone was going to turn heads,it would be him, not whoever Gabriela dragged along at the last minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Phyllis&#39;s mind, Gabriela was just bluffing, putting on a front for the crowd. No way could she actually pull this off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her own wedding only weeks away, Phyllis felt no  rush to expose Gabriela&#39;s lies-she was more than happy to let Gabriela keep up the charade. She&#39;d see for herself soon enough what sort of man Gabriela could really find.</p>
