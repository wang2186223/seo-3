                <p>Gabriela and Dustin had been inseparable all through college,dreaming up wedding plans the moment they got their diplomas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the minute Gabriela dove into her first real job,Dustin stabbed her in the back-hooking up with her cousin, Phyllis Haynes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t even bother to apologize. Instead, he looked her right in the eye and had the audacity to rationalize everything. &#34;Gabriela, I do care about you,but honestly? I care more about having money. We&#39;re adults now. We can&#39;t just float through life on feelings.Let&#39;s not kid ourselves-besides being gorgeous,what do you actually bring to the table? We&#39;ve dated for years, and you still won&#39;t let me touch you! Your parents are gone, and you have nothing to your name.If we-get married-if we ever buy a house or a car-it&#39;ll all come out of my family&#39;s pocket. It&#39;s not just the men&#39;s responsibility anymore; women have to contribute too. What can you offer? You can&#39;t even bring a single cent to the table. My mom&#39;s right-you&#39;re nothing but a burden. I&#39;m done. Let&#39;s just end it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Gabriela felt devastated, convinced that maybe she really wasn&#39;t enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that she finally saw Dustin for who he was,everything snapped into focus. The cause of their breakup had never been her-it was Dustin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to take advantage of his future wife for an easy life, all while spinning it so she&#39;d feel like the burden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if it weren&#39;t for their breakup, she wouldn&#39;t have drowned her sadness in wine, leading to a one-night stand with Brenden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In hindsight,she wanted to scream at her past self for ever being so blind. How had she let herself get swept up by someone like Dustin?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that he&#39;d wormed his way into Phyllis&#39;s life,Dustin strutted around in tailored suts, every inch the polished poser, his shameless charm replaced by a mask of fake sophistication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He intercepted Gabriela at the door, blocking her way.&#34;Why are you getting home so late? Phyllis hasn&#39;t slept a wink waiting for you, you know. You&#39;re a guest under someone else&#39;s roof-don&#39;t give the hosts anything to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela almost laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of his words. This was her own home!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On her deathbed, Gabriela&#39;s mother entrusted everything-eight-year-old Gabriela,the house,and the business-to her brother, Josh Haynes, asking him to take care of her daughter. That was how Phyllis&#39;s family ended up moving into the house her mother had left behind, all under the pretense of looking after Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,somehow,she&#39;d become the outsider in her own house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arguing felt pointless. She ignored Dustin. As she stepped forward to leave, his hand clamped down on her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you be so cold when Phyllis is concerned about you?&#34; Dustin scolded, his eyes hard and full of judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela didn&#39;t even bother to fake a smile. &#34;My phone was on the entire time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s excuse was quite flimsy. Who actually waited up for someone without just calling or texting these days? The whole thing was a theatrical act-and somehow,Dustin had fallen for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He really was hopeless. Dustin&#39;s scowl deepened, impatience seeping into his voice. &#34;Phyllis couldn&#39;t sleep because of you,and you still refuse to acknowledge her kindness? Is it that difficult to show a little warmth to your own family?After everything your uncle&#39;s family has done for you,this is how you act?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He threw his shoulders back, self-important. &#34;Go apologize to Phyllis. And from now on, let her know if you&#39;ll be late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela yanked her arm free and marched into the house,done playing along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis lounged across the sofa, one arm thrown over her forehead as if she might faint at any second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting Gabriela, she pushed herself upright, her voice trembling with practiced concern. &#34;Gabriela,you&#39;re finally back! I&#39;ve been worried sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela barely mustered a glance, exhaustion dulling her expression as she brushed past, intent on reaching her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Dustin caught her by the wrist. &#34;Seriously? Why the cold shoulder? Phyllis couldn&#39;t sleep because of you,and you just walk away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis rushed to play peacemaker,her tone soft and apologetic. &#34;Don&#39;t blame Gabriela, Dustin.She has the  right to be upset with me since I hurt her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dustin wrapped his arms around Phyllis, glaring daggers at Gabriela. &#34;This isn&#39;t on Phyllis,&#34; he said, his voice low and defensive. &#34;If you&#39;re upset, take it out on me. I told you-my feelings changed, that&#39;s all.Don&#39;t blame her for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela couldn&#39;t keep up the charade any longer.Her lips curled into a cold, dazzling smile. &#34;Oh,couldn&#39;t sleep? Sounds serious. Maybe get it checked out-insomnia&#39;s no joke. I&#39;d hate for you to drop dead from missing a few winks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words sliced through the room, and Phyllis&#39;s face drained of color. Tears sprang to her eyes, shimmering on the verge of falling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you say something like that, Gabriela?&#34;Phyllis&#39;s voice wavered with feigned hurt. &#34;You loved Dustin for so long-I get how much this must hurt. But you can&#39;t blame me for everything. Dustin and I, we genuinely love each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dustin&#39;s expression twisted, his jaw clenched in irritation. &#34;Gabriela, I never imagined you could be this bitter and petty. Honestly, I&#39;m disappointed in you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis immediately stepped in, pressing a gentle hand over Dustin&#39;s lips and gazing at Gabriela with an overdone look of sympathy. &#34;Let&#39;s not be too harsh,  Dustin. Poor Gabriela might never find another man as extraordinary as you. She&#39;ll just have to settle for a guy who is way beneath your league. I can only imagine how much she&#39;s hurting.I feel for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela let out a cold, dismissive laugh. Please, she had just spent the night with someone like Brenden.She didn&#39;t like Brenden, but next to Dustin, he was practically a prince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela refused to sink to Phyllis&#39;s level-she didn&#39;t have the energy for such pointless bickering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word,she retreated to her room and locked the door behind her, shutting out the noise from the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hot shower washed away some of her tension. Soon after, she sprawled across her bed, staring at the ceiling as the whirlwind of the past few days replayed in her mind-ridiculous, almost absurdly overblown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She braced herself for a sleepless night, certain her worries would keep her tossing and turning.Instead,exhaustion took over and she drifted off almost instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When morning came, Gabriela shrugged off the gloom like an old jacket, determined to reclaim her usual carefree self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the office, she barely had time to set down her bag before Aubrey appeared at her side, eyes sparkling with mischief. &#34;Did you hear the news? Mr.Saunders is getting transferred to one of the branch offices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s spirits soared. &#34;Wait,what happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, fortune seemed to smile on her. Things were working in her favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey leaned in, voice hushed. &#34;Everybody knows he&#39;s connected to Mr. Moss. Naturally, only Mr. Moss could have arranged for his transfer.&#34; She added,barely able to contain her smirk, &#34;He must&#39;ve crossed the line with Mr. Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He deserved that for antagonizing Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Gabriela&#39;s happiness faded as quickly as it arrived.She abruptly remembered she&#39;d left some things with Brenden, and a fresh wave of anxiety rolled in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Aubrey, her voice tense.&#34;Do you know when Mr. Saunders is leaving?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s pulse kicked up a notch-she had to retrieve her things from him before Brenden disappeared from headquarters for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard he&#39;s already clearing out his office. He&#39;ll be gone any minute,&#34; Aubrey murmured, glancing around warily. Without wasting another second, Gabriela rattled off a quick excuse, brushed past Aubrey, and ducked out of sight. She fished out her phone to send a message to Brenden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re really invested in him, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden, icy remark sliced through the air behind her. Gabriela&#39;s grip faltered; her phone nearly slipped from her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned around, heart pounding, to find Wesley standing just inside the doorway. What on earth was he doing in the sales department?</p>
