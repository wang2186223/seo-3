                <p>Dustin gazed at Gabriela, momentarily transfixed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her radiance was undeniable, commanding attention from every angle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took an instinctive step forward, her name nearly escaping his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s expression darkened instantly. She hissed through clenched teeth, &#34;Dustin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing his fiancée call his name brought him back to reality. He quickly donned a polished smile.&#34;Welcome,Gabriela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clad in a tailored white suit that accentuated his lean physique, Dustin looked strikingly handsome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the intensity in his eyes was unsettling, almost nauseating. Gabriela maintained a composed expression.&#34;Wishing you both a lifetime of joy,&#34; she said evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, those two were better off bound to each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered a perfunctory gift and went inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dustin&#39;s eyes lingered on her retreating form for a long moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s fists tightened, her resentment simmering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s entire look was surely calculated to command attention at her wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unconcerned with their opinions, Gabriela started looking for Josh to offer her congratulations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh and Marie were occupied with greeting guests,as were Dustin&#39;s parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dustin&#39;s mother, Doris Owen, elated that her son was marrying into wealth, beamed uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting Gabriela, she deliberately looked away,letting out a sharp, dismissive snort, as if her  presence might taint the occasion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dustin&#39;s father, Simeon Owen, a kind-hearted man,wanted to approach Gabriela, but Doris&#39;s quick pinch on his arm stopped him cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doris knew Marie disapproved of Gabriela. With a calculating glance, she approached Marie, her smile overly warm. &#34;Isn&#39;t that the girl you raised? Arriving so late?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marie cast a cool glance at Gabriela. &#34;She and Phyllis don&#39;t get along. It&#39;s enough that she showed up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The society women around Marie exchanged surprised glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard her mother died when she was eight, and your family took her in for over a decade. She seems rather distant, doesn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marie sighed, feigning regret. &#34;My husband&#39;s sister entrusted her to us before passing. I&#39;m not her mother, so l hesitated to discipline her too firmly.That&#39;s why she&#39;s grown so headstrong and bitter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>haven&#39;tfulfilled my duty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis, raised in opulence, still carried a trace of nouveau-riche flair.Marie, on the other hand, led the Haynes Group with the commanding presence of a seasoned businesswoman, earning admiration in elite circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her resigned demeanor lent credibility to her words,and those women readily deemed Gabriela ungrateful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially charmed by Gabriela&#39;s beauty and considering an introduction, one·of them now had second thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t realized that Gabriela&#39;s beauty was only a veneer over a flawed character.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed. &#34;It seems Gabriela&#39;s ungrateful. It&#39;s commendable your family honors its promises and hasn&#39;t cast her out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marie said nothing further, quietly endorsing the sentiment. Soon, the women in the group had silently labeled Gabriela as deplorable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela finally located Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face brightened at the sight of her. &#34;You look absolutely stunning today, Gabriela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exchanged a few words with him before settling into a corner seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t intended to stir trouble, but Vivian approached with a group of young ladies, closing in swiftly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You actually showed up, Gabriela? Haven&#39;t you humiliated yourself enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Phyllis overlooked your relentless pursuit of her fiancé. Have some dignity, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at your outfit today-so extravagant. Trying to outshine Phyllis on her big day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most guests had arrived. Phyllis and Dustin entered as the final jab landed. Phyllis&#39;s lips curved into a  subtle, satisfied smile, her earlier irritation easing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dustin kept his distance, but his eyes repeatedly drifted to Gabriela, his thoughts inscrutable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis paused, then pulled Josh toward Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With feigned concern, she asked, &#34;Where&#39;s your boyfriend, Gabriela? Didn&#39;t you say he&#39;d definitely be here? The banquet&#39;s about to start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh, caught up in the event, had forgotten. Now reminded, he looked at Gabriela expectantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;ll arrive soon,&#34; Gabriela replied calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How soon is &#39;soon&#39;?&#34; Vivian sneered. &#34;Don&#39;t tell me your boyfriend&#39;s stuck working overtime? Most reputable companies are off today. Or is he in some low-end service job?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A giggle rippled through the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another woman chimed in loudly, &#34;She probably doesn&#39;t even have a boyfriend-just making that up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter spread among them. &#34;I&#39;ll text him,&#34; Gabriela said, unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Texting&#39;s slow,&#34; Vivian taunted. &#34;Lucky for you, his girlfriend&#39;s right here. Why not ask her? That&#39;d be quicker.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s heart sank. Before she could respond, a short-haired woman in a pink gown stepped forward,eyeing her with open hostility. &#34;With a face like that,it&#39;s no wonder my boyfriend fell for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s brow furrowed. The woman pressed on,&#34;So, what number are you on Brenden&#39;s list of girlfriends?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela recalled Wesley mentioning Brenden was dating his forty-first girlfriend. So she was supposedly number forty-two? Better to deny knowing Brenden entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she considered this, a familiar voice called out,&#34;Renee,am I late?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s unease deepened. She turned to see Brenden. Dressed in a sharp dark blue suit, his confident stride and striking features drew attention despite his modest height.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee Nielsen linked her arm with his, pouting playfully. &#34;Honey, why are you so late?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden tapped her nose with affection. &#34;Traffic held me up, sweetheart. Don&#39;t be upset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s heart dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had prepared two plans: if Brenden didn&#39;t show,she&#39;d use a stand-in from a rent-a-date service.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she hadn&#39;t anticipated the worst-case scenario unfolding: Brenden and his girlfriend both showing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, she resolved never to admit knowing Brenden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee, however, had no intention of letting her off easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Brenden and complained, &#34;Honey, this woman claims you&#39;re her boyfriend and promised to attend the wedding with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nearby women erupted into loud, uunrestrained laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hilarious! Gabriela&#39;s boyfriend is a playboy with countless girlfriends. Place your bets-what&#39;s her number?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does it matter? At least someone&#39;s willing to take her.&#34;</p>
