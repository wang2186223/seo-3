                <p>Wesley gave a short, frosty laugh. &#34;Focus on your job.And keep your eyes off every other man in the room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela seethed silently. He really did have a short fuse-and the jealousy to match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She masked her annoyance behind a dazzling,innocent smile. &#34;You&#39;re way too handsome, Mr. Moss.If I get to see your face every day, how could I even notice anyone else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley gave another dry snort. &#34;Do you really mean that, or is this just flattery?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept laying on the compliments until his mood finally thawed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, one of Wesley&#39;s business associates appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Gabriela and said, &#34;Find somewhere out of the way and stay there. I&#39;ll come get you when I&#39;m finished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela promised she&#39;d behave, then wandered off,eager to escape and finally snag a plate of food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She barely had time to settle in before a sneering voice cut through the air. &#34;So, you&#39;re Mr. Moss&#39;s date for tonight? You&#39;ve got charm and beauty; it&#39;s no wonder he&#39;s into you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela turned around and found herself face-to-face with an attractive woman whose eyes were blazing with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a moment before she realized the woman was none other than the A-list celebority Claire Houghton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela knew she was captivating, but hearing such praise from someone who treated herself as the gold standard of beauty? That was a rare treat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but smile, her tone warm but not overly sweet. &#34;That&#39;s a big compliment. Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire clearly hadn&#39;t expected such an easygoing response. For a split second, her poise slipped, and surprise flickered across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, she had been in a bad mood all evening.Her entire styling squad had been whisked away at the last minute-supposedly to handle Gabriela&#39;s transformation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And to top it off, Wesley, notorious for his cold distance from women, had shown up with Gabriela on his arm. Worse yet, he&#39;d snatched Claire&#39;s prized stylist team just for her. The slight was impossible to ignore. Over the years, Claire had exhausted every trick she could think of to capture Wesley&#39;s attention. She&#39;d put on a show of dizziness, staged dramatic tumbles,and even once sprained her ankle in a desperate bid for sympathy-yet Wesley had never so much as spared her a second glance. Each failed attempt only fueled her frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, as she watched Wesley parade around the room with a nobody like Gabriela, Claire&#39;s resentment burned hotter than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All evening, she&#39;d been seething, just waiting for a chance to put Gabriela in her place. At last, she cornered Gabriela by herself, every line prepared-only to be thrown by how calmly Gabriela met her gaze. It appeared that Wesley&#39;s support boosted her confidence.The audacity was staggering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brushing back her hair with disdain, Claire sneered, &#34;Do you know who l am?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s smile stayed flawless as she replied, &#34;Of course I do. That show you starred in was huge.Actually,one of my coworkers is obsessed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you know exactly who I am,and you still have the guts to act like this?&#34; Claire arched her neck,radiating smugness, as if she was bestowing Gabriela with the honor of an apology. Gabriela was unfazed, her tone remaining sincere &#34;You paid me a compliment, and I thanked you.That&#39;s just good manners, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage spread across Claire&#39;s face, coloring it deep red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Gabriela mocking her-implying she didn&#39;t know the first thing about manners?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Gabriela act so superior? Was Wesley so smitten with her that she felt she could throw her weight around?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, Claire hesitated, thrown off by the possibility that Gabriela meant more to Wesley than she&#39;d realized. Irritated, she spat on the floor, fixed Gabriela with a piercing glare, and spun on her heel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out her phone, Claire scrolled to a WhatsApp contact, transferred a sum of money,and typed,&#34;Find out everything there is to know about Gabriela Haynes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reply came almost instantly. &#34;Consider it done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela couldn&#39;t be bothered by Claire&#39;s sour glare.All she could think was that Claire&#39;s so-called otherworldly beauty seemed ordinary now that she had seen it up close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t wait to share that little detail with Aubrey later. Then Gabriela turned her attention to the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One bite was perfectly savory, the next sweet, the following one crisp and golden-she sampled everything with reckless abandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually,she realized she&#39;d overdone it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she was stuffed to the point of discomfort, her stomach tight and bloated. Rubbing her middle, she glanced across the room and caught sight of Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was surrounded by a cluster of well-dressed guests, but he seemed to stand apart from the crowd,drawing every eye in the room with that magnetic presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even from a distance, he radiated authority,his profile sharper and more striking than anyone else&#39;s-even Vincent, the movie star, couldn&#39;t hold a candle to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela secretly wondered who would be deserving enough to stand beside him as his wife in the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still a little dazed from her brief fangirl high, she gave her rounded belly a gentle pat and slipped quietly into the garden for a stroll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hotel&#39;s garden sprawled before her,dominated by a glimmering pool and cascading artificial waterfalls.Despite the chill of winter in the air, flowers bloomed everywhere,lush and impossibly vibrant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The extravagance here was on a whole different level -being rich really did rewrite the laws of nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wandered between beds of color, admiring petals sparkling with frost. &#34;How do you manage to bloom like this in the dead of winter?&#34; she murmured, half-talking to the pampered flowers, half marveling at the absurdity of it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her phone vibrated sharply in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anew message flashed on her screen. &#34;Where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was from &#34;NotASaunders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She textedback immediately, &#34;In the garden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reply shot back almost at once, the tone clipped and unmistakably irked. &#34;I brought you as my date, and here you are,sneaking off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela blinked, puzzled. Brenden didn&#39;t attend the banquet at all. How could he be so well-informed about her every move?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed through her explanation. &#34;I ate too much.Just needed a walk to settle my stomach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few quiet moments, an unexpected message popped up. &#34;So, what do you think of Mr. Moss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela instantly straightened, her curiosity piqued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t this almost the exact question Wesley had tossed her way about Brenden earlier, back in the car?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now it felt like she&#39;d stumbled into some secret game where they were sizing up her loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined not to let anyone trip her up, Gabriela&#39;s fingers danced across her phone as she fired back.&#34;Mr. Moss is outrageously handsome! You should see it for yourself-every woman here is staring at him.Even Claire, who&#39;s supposedly the top beauty in the business, can&#39;t keep her eyes off him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worried her praise still wasn&#39;t enough, she immediately added, &#34;Honestly, I think he&#39;s the most attractive man in the event. Even the movie star Vincent doesn&#39;t come close.&#34;</p>
