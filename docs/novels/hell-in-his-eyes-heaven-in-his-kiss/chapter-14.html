                <p>Wesley glanced at Billy and remarked, &#34;We&#39;ll make a quick stop at Rosemont Gardens. I need to pick someone up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy shot him a puzzled look in the rearview mirror.Who in the world could possibly be so significant that Wesley himself would show up at their door?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosemont Gardens wasn&#39;t exactly exclusive-just a cluster of tastefully bland homes for the comfortably well-off.It was hardly the sort of place that drew VIPs.Still, someone there had managed to snag Wesley&#39;s personal attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t voice the question,just eased the car around with a silent nod and headed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Gabriela glanced at her phone and shot off a brisk &#34;Okay&#34; to &#34;NotASaunders&#34; before tossing the device onto the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew she didn&#39;t care about Brenden, not really Yet somehow,his text still managed to upset her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration simmering just beneath the surface,Gabriela dusted on a quick layer of makeup, snatched  up her purse, and strode downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second she pushed through the door, a sharp December breeze whipped against her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thin dress did nothing to keep out the chill, and she instinctively hunched her shoulders,grateful she&#39;d thought to bring a coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just started to shrug it on when Phyllis reappeared,practically glued to Dustin&#39;s side, parading her affection for everyone to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela breezed past them without so much as a glance, determined not to acknowledge their presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Phyllis&#39;s sharp gaze locked onto the deep blue dress hugging Gabriela&#39;s figure-a rare edition she&#39;d only ever admired in glossy magazine spreads,rumored to cost a jaw-dropping seven figures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy flickered in Phyllis&#39;s eyes, but with Dustin at her side, she kept her envy tightly masked. She affected a gentle tone and called out, &#34;Gabriela, are you going on a date with your boyfriend tonight? It&#39;s freezing out. No matter how much you want to turn heads,you really should cover up a little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words slid from her lips like honey,but the dig was razor sharp, aimed directly at Gabriela&#39;s bare shoulders and luminous, delicate skin-so flawless it seemed to give off its own soft glow, infuriatingly gorgeous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Phyllis saw Dustin&#39;s lingering gaze on Gabriela,she was filled with resentment. Dustin couldn&#39;t peel his eyes away from Gabriela, his gaze openly tracing every line of her exposed skin, barely disguising his desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That coat draped over Gabriela&#39;s arm appeared cheap,but the aura she radiated-carrying herself with effortless confidence-transformed it into a statement piece, giving her the poise of modern royalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashing a sugar-sweet smile, Gabriela replied, &#34;No worries. My boyfriend&#39;s taking me out to an exclusive event tonight. Central heating and all-I&#39;ll be perfectly cozy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she wasn&#39;t dating Brenden, Gabriela could play the part of a high-society girlfriend as smoothly as anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s expression soured. She leaned closer to Dustin, her tone dripping with contempt. &#34;Gabriela&#39;s found herself a wealthy boyfriend, but won&#39;t even introduce him to the family. I&#39;m honestly concerned she&#39;s fallen for some creepy older guy. Just yesterday,I tried to set her up with my mentor&#39;s son-a respectable, well-educated man. She practically</p>
                
                
                
                <p>turned her nose up and even offended him! | guess |was just mneddling in things that aren&#39;t my business after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dustin, never one to question what he was told,recalled the words Gabriela&#39;s colleague had said earlier.His jaw tightened in obvious irritation. &#34;Gabriela,I know l&#39;ve messed up and hurt you before, but you really shouldn&#39;t stoop this low. I&#39;m honestly disappointed in you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who did this arrogant clown thini he was, lecturing her like he had any right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, Gabriela found herself oddly grateful to Phyllis-at least now she saw Dustin&#39;s true nature with crystal clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My boyfriend isn&#39;t just wealthier than you-he&#39;s taller,better looking, and, best of all, he knows how to stay loyal.He won&#39;t cheat on me.Honestly, dating you was me stooping way too low.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flashed a breezy, dazzling smile as she finished,watching with satisfaction as both Dustin&#39;s and Phyllis&#39;s faces dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were her barbs so sharp that they struck a nerve with them? She hadn&#39;t thought they&#39;d both look so utterly floored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Gabriela took in their stunned silence, she caught their wide-eyed stares-only to realize they weren&#39;t even looking at her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spun around and spotted a sleek black Rolls-Royce pulled up at the curb, accompanied by a cluster of towering bodyguards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole scene radiated such quiet menace,no one in their right mind would dare approach.</p>
