                <p>At that moment, Brenden was having dinner with his girlfriend at Golden Days when a sudden sneeze caught him off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His girlfriend, already irritated, shot &#39;m a glare.&#34;Brenden, looks like some woman is thinking about you,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden threw up his hands, exasperated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might be a serial dater, but he always ended things cleanly before moving on. Even if he had his eye on someone new, he made a point to break up first-he was careless, not a cheater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly,someone was out there talking trash about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Gabriela stared in disbelief at the phrase &#34;thirty-ninth girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, she was speechless, floored by just how casually Brenden seemed to cycle through relationships.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaw clenched, she shot back. &#34;Keep dreaming!&#34; Wesley caught the message and a faint smirk flickered across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cloud over his mood finally eased, and he resisted the urge to tease her further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next to him, Loretta&#39;s praise for Fiona grew even more effusive, her disapproval barely masked as she noticed Wesley glued to his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wesley, listen to me,&#34; Loretta announce J her tone brooking no argument. &#34;I&#39;m very fond of Tiona.Tomorrow&#39;s the weekend, so I&#39;ve invited her for dinner. You&#39;d better be on your best behavior-no hiding behind work excuses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta took great pride in Fiona&#39;s polished family background, impressive education, and gentle disposition. She made up her mind to push Wesley and Fiona together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley let out a weary sigh. &#34;Grandma, my career is only just getting off the ground.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You already have more money than you can spend in a lifetime!&#34; Loretta shot back, her glare sharp. &#34;You&#39;re thirty-one, Wesley. If you don&#39;t settle down soon,how am I supposed to live long enough to see my great-grandchildren?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing she was about to launch into another tirade, Wesley relented. &#34;Grandma, I actually like someone.I&#39;ll bring her over to meet you someday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta&#39;s eyes narrowed with suspicion. &#34;Who is she,then? What&#39;s her family background? Are you seriously telling me she&#39;s a better catch than Fiona?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Loretta&#39;s mind, nobody could possibly measure up to Fiona.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s relentless dedication to his ca eer made it impossible for her to believe he&#39;d developed foelings for anyone overnight. She remained convinced he was simply dodging any talk of marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With sincere composure, Wesley offered, &#34;She&#39;s a decent person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only flaw he saw? She could provoke his anger effortlessly-while remaining completely oblivious to what sparked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta was ready to press the subject further when Wesley&#39;s phone buzzed again. He glanced down at the screen,immediately reaching for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, it wasn&#39;t Gabriela&#39;s message that popped up,but Fiona&#39;s-a contact he found increasingly irritating</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wesley,weekend kicks off tomorrow-are you free?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, Fiona&#39;s messages kept flooding in, making Wesley even more determined to tune her out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Fiona sat in front of her phone, irritation simmering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d fired off message after message, but Wesley hadn&#39;t bothered replying-not even with a perfunctory emoji.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually, with so many suitors clam oring for her attention, Fiona never had to chase anyone Wesley&#39;s aloofness, however,left her baffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She debated whether she had stooped to something as childish as hurling an insult just to get a reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking back to the faint, almost amused smile she&#39;d seen flicker across Wesley&#39;s face last time, Fiona steeled herself and typed out a gamble. &#34;Hey, jerk,want to go watch a movie with me tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of ignoring her, Wesley actually responded-if a question mark even counted as a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That tiny sign of life only fueled Fiona&#39;s determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot back another message. &#34;Seriously, you jerk,is that all you can manage? Too busy to even answer me properly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley glanced at his phone, then at Loretta,who was still waxing poetic about Fiona&#39;s many charms. A sly idea flickered through his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He replied, &#34;And you are...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona&#39;s anger simmered dangerously</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he act like she was a stranger? She was used to being admired and chased. Now, barely a week after they&#39;d become friends on WhatsApp,he had forgotten about her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how many texts she fired off, ia stayed silent-until she threw an insult his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That alone made her suspicious. Was this legendary business genius actually into being scolded?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The possibility left he both irritated and oddly intrigued. Refusing to back down, Fiona typed with swift, determined fingers.&#34;It&#39;s me, Fiona. How dare you forget me, you jerk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fired back, &#34;Really? I don&#39;t think you are Fiona.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Fiona hit record,her voice sharp and taunting. &#34;You jerk, does my voice finally ring a bell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley switched his phone to speaker, letting Loretta hear every word for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta sat frozen in disbelief, the elegant image she&#39;d built of Fiona crumbling in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Fiona always seemed so poised and sweet. How could she possibly say such things to you?&#34; she stammered, her voice thick with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word,Wesley handed her his phone, letting the barrage of Fiona&#39;s sharp-tongued messages speak for themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta slipped on her reading glasses, scrutinizing the screen as her expression shifted from co, fusion to utter dismay. She simply couldn&#39;t reconcile this with the girl she thought she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned by her discovery-and embarrassed by how enthusiastically she&#39;d just praised Fiona-Loretta let out a weary sigh. &#34;Did spending a few years overseas really turn her into a different person?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley didn&#39;t let the chance slip by. &#34;Grandma, you can&#39;t just judge people based on how they look or what they say. You really have to take your time and see what they&#39;re actually like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy sigh, Loretta admitted, &#34;I got it wrong this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That realization finally convinced her to stop pressuring Wesley about marriage-at least for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of relief swept over Wesley. Without  hesitation, he unfriended Fiona on WhatsApp right there in front of Loretta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Fiona was left staring at her phone,perplexed by the silence that greeted her latest voice message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered how gently Wesley had replied to that rude message and wondered if her rebuke hadn&#39;t been sharp or inventive enougl</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After trawling the internet for clever ults, Fiona composed another cutting message and hit send-only to discover, moments later, that she&#39;d been unfriended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her features shifted from confusion to disbelief,then settled into a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was happening here? Why did the other person receive a polite reply from Wesley after sending insults, while she ended up being unfriended for doing the same thing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For someone used to being the center of attention,Fiona found it unbearable to be dismissed so abruptly and without explanation. The slight gnawed at her pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind drifted to Brenden-the ever-smiling one who seemed to get along with everyone, Wesley included. Reluctant but determined to get answers, she sent a message to him. &#34;Hey Brenden,are you free today? Want to grab a bite with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden had just picked up his phone to ask his new girlfriend out when Fiona&#39;s message landed, catching him off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been practically icy toward him at Loretta&#39;s house-so why was she suddenly asking him to dinner?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the invitation seemed suspici &#39;is, Brenden never minded making time for a pretty won n.He agreed without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, they met at Golden Days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona tamped down her revulsion, offered him a plastic smile, and tossed out a few half-hearted pleasantries, even going so far as to apologize for her aloofness back at Loretta&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden found her sudden sweetness downright unsettling. He shifted in his seat and cut to the chase.&#34;So,why the dinner invitation out of the blue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona lowered her gaze and spoke in a careful,tentative voice. &#34;Brenden, you&#39;re close with Wesley,aren&#39;t you? Do you know what he&#39;s actually into?Back at Loretta&#39;s, he barely looked my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden rubbed his jaw, lost in thought for a moment. Wesley&#39;s life revolved around work-he was cool,distant, almost impossible to approach. Loretta was the only one who ever coaxed out a trace of warmth from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Brenden replied, &#34;Wesley&#39;s just...reserved. He needs time to let anyone in. Stick around long enough, and you&#39;ll figure him out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona&#39;s face fell. &#34;But he untric nded me on WhatsApp.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Brenden just shrugged. That&#39;s classic Wesley.His whole world is work-women don&#39;t even register on his radar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She studied Brenden, voice wary.&#34;Does he have any odd habits or, like, unusual preferences?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden stared at her, completely thrown off by the question, because as far as he knew, Wesley had no unusual preferences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just about to say so when Fiona, gnawing her lip,pressed on. &#34;Is he the type who actually likes being scolded?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That question nearly sent Brenden tumbling out of his chair. He shot her an incredulous look.&#34;Are you even hearing yourself right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona began her explanation. &#34;I saw him texting</p>
                
                
                
                <p>someone the other day. The person kept calling him a jerk and insulting him, but instead of getting mad,Wesley was grinning the whole time. It honestly looked like he was into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden was left speechless, floored by her revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath Wesley&#39;s polished exterior lurked a merciless workaholic, the kind of boss who could freeze an entire boardroom with a glance. No one in the company dared cross hin -not even the top executives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden never imagined anyone would have the nerve to talk back to Wesley, let alone scold him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea made him curious, almost amused, about who could be that audacious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then he snapped back to the matter at hand.&#34;Hang on-what does this have to do with him dropping you from his contacts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona wavered, her lips pressed together as she struggled to answer. &#34;I sent Wesley a few messages,and he ignored every single one. So I figured...maybe if I scolded him the way that person did, he&#39;d respond.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden&#39;s jaw practically hit the floor. &#34;Are you serious? That actually happened? I don&#39;t buy it!&#34;</p>
