                <p>Wesley&#39;s car offered generous space, yet the air inside seemed saturated with his presence-an unshakable, magnetic force that pressed in on Gabriela until it was almost stifling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat quietly for a long while before she finally gathered the nerve to murmur, &#34;Thanks for stepping in earlier, Mr.Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was soft, her posture modest, which earned her a quiet, low chuckle from him. &#34;And what exactly am I being thanked for?&#34; he asked, a trace of amusement curling at the edge of his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For pretending to be my... boyfriend,&#34; she admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without his intervention, she would have been left defenseless against Josh&#39;s emotional outburst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could only bring herself to utter &#34;boyfriend&#34; in a voice full of courtesy and sincerity. Wesley slid her a sidelong glance, the motion slow and deliberate, before giving the faintest nod. His profile, carved in the cool light, carried an imposing elegance that made him seem even more unreachable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela couldn&#39;t quite put her finger on why his mood had darkened so abruptly, and the shift left her slightly on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she ventured with quiet concern, &#34;Weren&#39;t you and Mr. Clarke supposed to be in Athea for a project?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just stepped off the plane hours ago,&#34; Wesley said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he didn&#39;t mention was how he&#39;d crammed his schedule into an exhausting blur just to shave a day off the trip-enduring Billy&#39;s complaints and the think tank&#39;s protests the entire time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant he touched down, he&#39;d swapped into the tailored suit she&#39;d picked for him, headed straight to the Deluxe Hotel, and let everyone see, without question, that she was his girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earn gift cards Yet even with that unspoken declaration, the little fool still clung to formality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the faint weariness in his eyes made Gabriela&#39;s chest tighten with an unfamiliar ache. She wasn&#39;t meant to have felt that way-not given her place-but she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her gaze slid toward him again, she realized her coat and his suit were almost a perfect match, as if they&#39;d dressed for each other without knowing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp breath snagged in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gown she&#39;d worn to the wedding, the one she&#39;d thought was a casual favor from Brenden, had actually been handed to her by Wesley himself.Maybe it had never been Brenden&#39;s gift at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her mouth to ask, but the car eased to a stop before she could speak. &#34;Get out,&#34; Wesley said,his voice low but firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping onto the pavement, Gabriela blinked in surprise at the stretch of open sea before them. &#34;Why bring me here?&#34; she asked, curiosity threading her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s gaze dropped to meet hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had spent years moving through glittering circles,surrounded by elegant women draped in designer gowns. Yet he couldn&#39;t ignore how Gabriela stood apart-her beauty sharpened by those clear,luminous eyes that held no pretense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A salty breeze teased at the hem of her skirt,sending it swaying, and her faintly furrowed brows gave her an almost childlike innocence that tugged at something deep in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the woman he had set his heart on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step toward her, but the sky dimmed and a fine drizzle began to fall, the air turning crisp in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, who moments ago had been stiff with nerves, brightened suddenly. &#34;I&#39;lI get the umbrella!&#34;she blurted, her voice laced with purpose. Ever since she&#39;d become his personal secretary,she&#39;d made it a habit to stash an umbrella in the trunk of his car. She only hoped no one had taken it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurrying over, she popped the trunk. Relief washed over her-the umbrella was still there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She returned to Wesley, the handle gripped firmly in her hand. Rising on tiptoe, she tilted it over his head,her gaze lifting to meet his as the rain whispered down around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind roared in from the sea, nearly yanking the umbrella from her grasp, but Gabriela tightened her hold, determined to shield Wesley from the pelting rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She might have looked delicate, yet she stood braced against the storm, refusing to yield an inch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley reached over, taking the handle from her while his other hand slipped around her right arm,steadying her against the wind. He wore no cologne, yet as he leaned in, she caught a fresh, clean scent from him-cool, yet threaded with an unshakable authority that made her pulse jump. Heat rushed to her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;M-Mr. Moss... let me do it,&#34; she stammered,clutching for the handle again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A boss who paid her such a generous salary wasn&#39;t supposed to be the one holding the umbrella over her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you shaking?&#34; Wesley&#39;s brows drew together, his voice carrying a husky edge. &#34;Come here. Don&#39;t let the rain soak you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela instinctively lifted her gaze and was caught by the unwavering intensity in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about this felt wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just his secretary-yet he&#39;d rushed straight from the airport to the hotel to stand up for her. And now...he was holding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, Aubrey&#39;s playful voice echoed in her  mind. &#34;Mr. Moss came to your rescue and drove you home-was there a little chemistry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela had once laughed off Aubrey&#39;s wild talk about the boss, dismissing it as nothing more than idle nonsense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, even she felt a reckless spark of curiosity-could Wesley actually be interested in her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat flared in her cheeks as she buried her face in her hands, her pulse thudding against her palms. The flutter in her chest could have been excitement, yet a heavy,aching sadness curled beneath it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley was not just handsome-he was striking, with the kind of effortless elegance and staggering wealth that made him seem untouchable. He had always been her crush. And if by some impossible chance he liked her in return, she could imagine herself agreeing before he even finished the question,nodding until she was dizzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the thought of saying yes came tangled with dread. Because the moment she dared step closer to Wesley, she knew Brenden would find out-and that discovery could shatter everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word was, Brenden was Wesley&#39;s cousin-and nothing thrilled him more than ratting someone out.She knew he&#39;d have no trouble turning her in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he found out about her on-nightstand with Brendan, would he think she&#39;d been two-timing him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would be the end of her career.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Absolutely not. She couldn&#39;t afford to lose her job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from her, Wesley watched her face cycle through surprise, worry, and defiance, clearly amused by the constant flicker of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he didn&#39;t love her wvith the depth of a lifelong passion, but for years she&#39;d been the one who mattered most to him. Her presence coaxed smiles from him without effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was willing to have her stay by his side forever. In his head, a sharp whisper demanded, &#34;Now&#39;s the time-tell her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he didn&#39;t realize was that, in the span of seconds, her mind had veered from romantic fantasy to cold, practical considerations about her career.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew a breath, squared his shoulders, and said,&#34;Gabriela, I think you&#39;re extraordinary. Would you be willing...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lungs caught, and in the boldest rush of words she&#39;d ever managed, she cut in. &#34;I&#39;m sorry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The emotion still blazing in Wesley&#39;s eyes dimmed with stunned disbelief, the edges reddened as if the shock itself had scalded him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela studied Wesley&#39;s face with cautious precision, trying to read the flickers of his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the CEO of the Apex Group-wealth, status,and authority wrapped in one man-and she had just turned him down. Desperate to soften the blow, she blurted the first excuse that popped into her head, &#34;I&#39;ve always wanted a boyfriend I could look straight in the eye.You&#39;re...far too tall for my taste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words stopped him cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even she felt the jolt of shock as they left herlips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t just turned him down-she&#39;d picked him apart,piece by piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn. She was done-had to kiss that job goodbye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The uneasy silence was broken by a sudden volley of fireworks bursting in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brilliant blooms splashed across the dark sky,unfurling into shimmering heart shapes before fading into the drizzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the umbrella, both of them glanced up in faint surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s gaze lingered on the vibrant display, her thoughts a tangled knot of wonder and restraint. Seaside air, rain-slick night, and heart-shaped fireworks-by all rights, it was the perfect setting for romance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet in her mind, the steady hum of a paycheck still rang sweeter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, no matter how beautiful the moment,fireworks couldn&#39;t pay the rent or fill the fridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Gabriela was still caught in that flicker of regret, a figure emerged from the far edge of the dimly lit boardwalk-Billy, cradling a lush bouquet in his arms like a precious offering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Wesley&#39;s ever-resourceful assistant, Billy took pride in staying two steps ahead of his boss&#39;s needs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And today, the moment Wesley&#39;s feet touched home soil, he had gone straight for Gabriela, his purpose written plainly/in every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy,sharp enough to catch the unspoken, had made sure fireworks were set to blaze the sky and flowers were ready to seal the moment. With such flawless foresight, surely he deserved a generous bonus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pictured it already-Wesley&#39;s curt but approving nod, maybe even the faint curl of a smile. Feeling rather pleased with himself, Billy advanced toward them at an easy pace, bouquet poised in both hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just drawing a breath to present it when Wesley&#39;s gaze cut to him-cold, razor-sharp, and merciless. The look hit him like a bucket of ice water,prickling his skin and freezing his steps mid-stride.</p>
