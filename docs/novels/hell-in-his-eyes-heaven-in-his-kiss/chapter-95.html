                <p>Chapter95 Wesley Owes His Life To Myah&#39;s Brother</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young woman turned out to be blind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myah, so glad you&#39;re here,&#34; Loretta said warmly,her face brightening as she hurried over to steady Myah Espinoza by the arm. &#34;I made your favorite hand pie.I hope you enjoy it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I appreciate it, Mrs. Larson,&#34; Myah murmured, her tone quiet and unsure. After that brief response, she lapsed into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta and Miriam rushed to place gifts in Myah&#39;s hands, holding on as if afraid to let go. Their voices brimmed with worry as they asked after her,their pity clear when they noticed how much weight she&#39;d lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They fussed over her with the tenderness of doting grandmothers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, Brenden set aside his usual playful manner and greeted her earnestly. &#34;Long time no see, Myah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley stepped forward with an unexpectedly gentle air, his tone low and careful. &#34;Delia mentioned that you were sick a few days ago. Are you feeling any better now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid trailing behind, Delia Pope, quíckly answered,&#34;Miss Espinoza has recovered now. Please don&#39;t worry sir. I&#39;ll make sure to take good care of her from here on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah&#39;s brows pinched faintly, the formal tone clearly unsettling her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the moment Wesley&#39;s presence drew near, her tension eased, and she breathed out softly, &#34;Wesley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out with an easy smile, ruffling her hair in a gentle pat. &#34;Now that Myah&#39;s here, let&#39;s sit down to eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela,watching from the side,was struck-she had never witnessed Wesley treat anyone with such warmth. The sight only sharpened her cuiosity about Myah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she reminded herself that she was merely his secretary; prying into his private matters would be reckless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah suddenly turned toward Gabriela, her voice barely above a whisper.&#34;Mrs. Larson, are there other guests in the house today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question startled Gabriela. She hadn&#39;t uttered a word,yet Myah had somehow sensed her presence despite being unabole to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela quickly responded, &#34;Nice to meet you, Miss Espinoza. I&#39;m Gabriela-Mr. Moss&#39;s secretary. During the New Year, I&#39;ve been lending a hand in the kitchen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her explanation came out longer than necessary, as if she worried Myah might misinterpret her presence,which drew a faint crease across Wesley&#39;s brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Myah heard her name, her hand faltered, and the color drained slightly from her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice sharpened with urgency. &#34;Gabriela? You&#39;re from the Haynes family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela blinked. &#34;Yes, that&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah pressed, her tone tinged with agitation.&#34;Don&#39;t you know who I am? It&#39;s me-Myah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley stiffened at once, his eyes flicking toward Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the room exchanged puzzled looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s mind went blank, her voice faltering. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t recall ever meeting you. You must be confusing me with someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her denial, Myah&#39;s expression crumpled. She  lowered her head for several seconds before slowly lifting her face again. &#34;My apologies. I thought your voice sounded familiar, but I must have been mistaken.After so many years, it&#39;s possible her voice has changed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faint disappointment in her expression stirred a trace of sympathy in Gabriela, who quickly offered reassurance. &#34;It&#39;s alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah lapsed into silence again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam emerged from the kitchen carrying the dishes,her voice brisk as she called everyone to the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the meal, the household&#39;s attention remained largely fixed on Myah. She, however, spoke sparingly,maintaining a polite reserve throughout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally tasted the pumpkin stew,her lips curved faintly. &#34;This stew is wonderful. Mrs. Larson,your cooking seems to get better every year.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta laughed warmly. &#34;Actually, Gabriela prepared it this time. Her touch outshines mine these days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah paused, taken aback. &#34;Gabriela made this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela offered a gentle smie. &#34;Mm-hmm. If you enjoyed it, come by more often andI&#39;ll make it again for you.&#34; &#34;Thanks, Gabriela,&#34; Myah murmured, her voice barely above a whisper, before retreating back into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the meal ended, she rose almost at once,insisting she had to be going</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta coaxed gently, &#34;Myah, why don&#39;t you spend the New Year here at the estate? Your room&#39;s already waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah gave a small shake of her head, her voice quiet but firm. &#34;I appreciate it, but I feel more at ease on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing the weight Myah carried inside,Loretta didn&#39;t argue further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,she carefully packed some food and passed it to Delia, repeating her instructions to watch over Myah with extra care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah reassured Loretta, &#34;Even without Delia, I&#39;m capable of looking after myself. You don&#39;t have to keep treating me like I&#39;m helpless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta, however, couldn&#39;t shake her concern. She hovered beside her, walking her to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Myah settled into the seat, Loretta&#39;s face clouded with sadness. She sighed over and over,whispering, &#34;That poor girl...&#34; Wesley also seemed downcast. Once dinner ended, he withdrew straight into the study and stayed there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, meanwhile, found herself intrigued by Myah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Myah heard her name, she had appeared thrilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, Gabriela knew in her heart she had never seen Myah before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her curiosity tightly reined in, refraining from prying for more information about Myah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, she wandered the garden paths, letting the crisp night air and the scent of pine ease the heaviness of her meal, before retreating to her room to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The estate carried a subdued air-no one seemed inclined to stay up and welcome the New Year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She considered calling Aubrey on video. Her thoughts were interrupted when Miriam slipped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gabriela, didn&#39;t it stir even a little curiosity in you,seeing Myah here today?&#34; Miriam asked, watching her closely, aware of the feelings Gabriela harbored for Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most women might have felt a twinge of jealousy seeing another young woman arrive at the estate and receive such affection from Wesley. Gabriela,however,stayed perfectly composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela gave her head a small shake, signaling she had no interest in gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Gabriela claimed not to be curious,Miriam still worried she might get the wrong idea about Wesley and Myah. Wanting to clear the air, she offered a brief explanation. &#34;Wesley owes his life to Myah&#39;s brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words trailed off into silence, her expression clouded with a wistful melancholy, as if some sad memory had surfaced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That hint of sorrow drew Gabriela in, and she asked gently, &#34;And what happened to Myah&#39;s brother? Why wasn&#39;t he here for dinner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s gone,&#34; Miriam answered with a weary sigh, her voice weighted with sorrow. &#34;Such a good boy-but his life ended far too young, barely past twenty.Poor Myah... she and her brother only had each other,and when he passed, she was left utterly alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before his death, Myah&#39;s brother had asked Wesley to take care of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley had tried to bring Myah into the estate,but no matter how many times he persuaded her, she refused. So he bought her a house in another neighborhood and arranged for several maids to care for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam fell silent after that, carefully avoiding any mention of how Myah&#39;s brother had died, as if the subject itself carried a shadow no one dared disturb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela sensed it wasn&#39;t something she should pry into-every family,especially one this powerful, had its share of secrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes ignorance was the safest shield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Miriam finally spoke again, she gave Gabriela&#39;s hand a gentle pat, her tone quiet but earnest.&#34;Mr.Moss is in low spirits today. If you can spare a little time,would you sit with him for a while?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela gave a quick nod. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after agreeing did it dawn on her-what business did a secretary like her have trying to lift his spirits?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, since Miriam had asked, Gabriela rose from her seat, warmed a cup of milk, and carried it carefully toward Wesley&#39;s study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door lingered ajar, the silence behind it heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Brenden sat with his head bowed like a schoolboy caught in trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Gabriela approached, Wesley&#39;s sharp voice cut through the silence, laced with irritation. &#34;Touch my things without permission again, and you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
