                <p>&#34;NotASaunders&#34; sent another message that carried a clear note of skepticism. &#34;So Mr. Moss doesn&#39;t have any flaws whatsoever?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate to come up with a harmless flaw, Gabriela typed,&#34;Well, his legs are ridiculously long. He always walks so fast that I&#39;m left chasing after him. Does that even count as a flaw?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hit send and stared at her screen, waiting for any sign of a reply. Seconds dragged into minutes, but her phone stayed stubbornly silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Wesley slipped his phone into his pocket,quietly excusing himself from a businessman who tried to strike up conversation, and made his way toward the garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy trailed after him, unable to hide his astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All evening, Wesley had kept one eye on his phone,and just a moment ago, Billy could&#39;ve sworn he saw the man actually smiling at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was utterly unthinkable. Wesley, known for his icy,no-nonsense demeanor, had smiled in a message? Was lhe really falling for someone? It would certainly explain why his moods tonight had swung so wildly.clear skies one moment, thunderclouds the inext.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But who could this extraordinary woman be-the one who thawed his glacial heart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in thought, Billy was startled when Wesley&#39;s cool voice cut through the silence. &#34;Take the car and go.Make sure the guards leave,too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy blinked in disbelief. In all his years at Wesley&#39;s side,he&#39;d never heard such a strange command.&#34;Sir,if I drive off,how will you get home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s calm gaze never wavered, brooking no argument. Billy swallowed, gave a crisp nod, and hurried out,leading the bodyguards away as instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out in the moonlit garden, Gabriela was still quietly admiring the winter flowers when a familiar, low voice reached her. &#34;Gabriela.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and saw Wesley moving through the shadows,his posture relaxed, his presence impossibly magnetic in the chilly night air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was irresistibly breathtaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s heart responded with a tender flutter she couldn&#39;t ignore. &#34;Time to go,&#34; Wesley said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Gabriela realize the banquet had ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She trailed after him to the hotel entrance-only to find the driveway empty, the expected car nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The car broke down,&#34; Wesley announced in a steady tone.&#34;I&#39;ve sent it for repairs. We&#39;ll have to grab a taxi out front.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela almost blurted out her disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d spotted at least two other luxury sedans tailing them earlier-how could he lie so smoothly, without the faintest flicker of guilt?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she didn&#39;t dare challenge him, not when just holding his gaze made her palms sweat. Forcing a bright, breezy smile, she trailed after him as if everything was perfectly normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was well past eleven. The city had slipped into a hush,and the nearly deserted street seemed to belong to them alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they strolled side by side, their shadows stretched across the pavement, tangled together in the golden streetlight-a scene so gentle and quiet it almost felt stolen. Gabriela gradually realized something was off.Wesley,who usually outpaced everyone with those impossibly long strides, had slowed down to a pace even she could manage in high heels. More than once, she found herself pausing and glancing back, only to see him lagging behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recalled him complaining earlier in the car about getting scratched by a cat, and her worry bubbled up.&#34;Is your back still sore, Mr. Moss? Is that why you&#39;re walking so slowly tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley shot her a sidelong look, his eyes unreadable.&#34;You have a problem with the way I walk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question caught Gabriela off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at him, momentarily thrown. Then the realization struck-Wesley had gotten jealous about Vincent earlier. Vincent had starred in a classic film,strolling in slow motion to dramatic music, exuding effortless cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Wesley actually be competing with Vincent&#39;s charm?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela nearly laughed out loud as the realization dawned on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So men cared about appearances just as much as women did-maybe even more. She threw him a reassuring smile. &#34;Honestly, I think you look great no matter how you walk, Mr. Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley stopped abruptly, pinning her in place with a look both sharp and unreadable. After a moment, his lips curled in a wry half-smile. &#34;You little liar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Gabriela forgot how to breathe.Was she really that easy to read?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fumbled for another charming reply, but her mind drew a blank. Embarrassed, she just let the silence settle between them, the hush deepening under the streetlights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, out of nowhere, Wesley&#39;s tone softened as he asked, &#34;You did well tonight. Is there anything you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That question snapped her out of it. Gabriela&#39;s head shot up, eyes suddenly bright with anticipation. &#34;What do you mean, Mr. Moss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he offering her a raise? Or maybe he intended to help her close that enormous deal with Mason?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever you wish for, just tell me-I&#39;ll make it happen for you.&#34; Wesley studied her, his eyes shining with an odd sort of patience, as if silently urging her to say whatever she truly wanted. Gabriela wavered, uncertainty flickering across her face. After a brief pause, she gathered her courage.&#34;Um... once my internship ends, is there a chance l could officially join the company?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s features went cold in an instant, a thundercloud settling over his expression. &#34;That&#39;s it?That&#39;s all you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reaction rattled her. Gabriela&#39;s heart dropped, and a sharp wave of regret rushed in. Of course he&#39;d caught her playing it safe-he&#39;d probably meant for her to reach for something bolder, and instead she&#39;d exposed herself as yet another intern angling for a shortcut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder he dominated the business world-he could read people with a glance and see straight through every ploy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic welled up inside her as she realized the damage was likely done. That was the end of her hopes to become a full-time employee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate, Gabriela scrambled to fix her mistake. &#34;I swear,Mr.Moss-I&#39;ll prove myself.I&#39;ll work harder than anyone, earn my spot here, and give everything I&#39;ve got to this company!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fixed his gaze on her, brows drawn in wary disbelief. &#34;Seriously? That&#39;s it? You&#39;re sure you don&#39;t want anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the way he hovered, clearly expecting her to ask for more, Gabriela hesitated, then lowered her voice. &#34;Actually, since it&#39;s freezing and already way past midnight... do you think I could get paid double overtime?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression didn&#39;t budge as he queried,&#34;You really think tonight qualifies as overtime?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t it? Gabriela blinked, momentarily thrown off by the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His features remained perfectly composed, his voice flat,but underneath, Gabriela sensed a storm brewing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was genuinely furious and no amount of sweet talk could even hope to thaw him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gazed at his imposing, broad-shouldered silhouette and felt a sinking feeling grip her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully,he was acting ridiculously petty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she brought up money, his mood detonated. Of course he&#39;d be ruthless-he hadn&#39;t clawed his way to the top of the business world for nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this was the legend who supposedly made millions every minute? Apparently, just mentioning overtime pay was enough to strike a nerve.</p>
