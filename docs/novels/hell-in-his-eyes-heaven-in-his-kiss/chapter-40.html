                <p>Fresh from a hot shower, Gabriela was ready to crawl into bed when her phone erupted with an unending stream of notifications. The screen lit up again and again-every one from Phyllis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got one minute to remove that post-don&#39;t test me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me back my hair, now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You rotten witch! I&#39;ll make you pay, sooner or later!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis had clearly seen the photo Gabriela had posted. Rage practically dripped from every word, as if she wished she could rip Gabriela apart with her bare hands. But lacking the nerve to confront her in person, she hid behind her phone, firing off venom from a safe distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One message followed another-ten in quick succession-each packed with insults sharper than the last, a relentless barrage meant to claw under Gabriela&#39;s skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still basking in her good mood, Gabriela typed back with unhurried confidence. &#34;Screenshots saved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The torrent of abuse cut off instantly. Moments later, Phyllis called, her voice ragged with fury. &#34;What the hell do you want, Gabriela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s tone was almost lazy. &#34;That&#39;s something you should be asking yourself. Just pray Rhys doesn&#39;t cross my path tomorrow. Because every stunt he&#39;s pulled on me? I&#39;ll make sure you suffer it ten times worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Phyllis faltered, memories flashing of the wild punks Gabriela had run with in high school.The thought made her jaw tighten-but she swallowed her resentment and fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers brushed the sore spot on her scalp where the hair had been ripped out, a mix of fear and simmering hatred twisting in her chest. Inwardly, she swore she&#39;d bide her time and make Gabriela pay for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s phone finally fell silent. Deciding Phyllis wasn&#39;t worth another second of her evening, she tossed it aside, set her alarm, and resolved to be up early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley had gone out of his way to help her today; the least she could do was prepare an extravagant breakfast to thank him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just pulled the covers over herself when a sharp knock echoed through the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance flared instantly. Certain it was Phyllis trying to push her luck, Gabriela strode to the door with her jaw tight and her glare ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she swung it open, Josh stood there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s anger still clung to her like static, and Josh&#39;s eyes flickered with uncertainty. Softening his voice,he asked, &#34;Can I come in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, she stepped aside, and Josh slipped inside with quick, almost furtive movements, shutting the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle Josh.&#34; Gabriela mustered a polite smile. &#34;Why are you still up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleep just wouldn&#39;t come to me.&#34; He stepped inside, his gaze drifting over the room&#39;s plain, almost stark interior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bed, a desk, and little else-none of the cozy trinkets or splashes of color one might expect in a young woman&#39;s space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight made his chest tighten, a wave of guilt and tenderness washing over him. He lingered for a moment before speaking, his voice edged with hesitation. &#34;About what you said to Phyllis earlier...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela answered evenly, &#34;It was the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh lowered his head slightly, regret darkening his eyes. &#34;This is my fault.&#34; His chest tightened with guilt,the words tumbling out rough and uncertain.&#34;A∥Ithese years, Marie&#39;s been handling everything. Sometimes she&#39;d even say good things about you. I assumed you and Phyllis were fine... I didn&#39;t realize you&#39;d been putting up with so much. I&#39;m sorry, Gabriela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela let out a faint smile. &#34;It&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The worst storms were long past. She&#39;d made it to adulthood intact, and that alone felt like a gift that she had no intention of tarnishing with resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gabriela...&#34; Her calm expression only deepened the ache in him. On impulse, Josh fished a thick fold of bills from his pocket and pressed it into her palm. &#34;Here. Use this for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That won&#39;t be necessary.&#34; Gabriela quickly pushed the money back into his hand. She knew too well how tightly Marie gripped the household finances-this surely was scraped together in secret. Her voice softened, steady with quiet pride. &#34;I&#39;ve got a job now. I can take care of myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve only just started working-how much could you possibly earn?&#34; Josh sighed, sliding the money toward her again.&#34;A-young woman should treat herself-buy some decent clothes, maybe a bit of makeup.Just take it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela could feel the sincerity behind his gesture. With a helpless smile, she accepted the money, warmth flickering in her chest. &#34;I appreciate it, Uncle Josh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her earlier spat with Phyllis replayed in her mind, and she was grateful it hadn&#39;t upset him enough to strain his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s gaze softened. &#34;I didn&#39;t even notice-you&#39;ve grown so much.&#34; He reached out, ruffling her hair with a fond, almost paternal touch, a quiet smile lifting his face. &#34;When I first moved into this house, I promised your mother that when the time came, I&#39;d put the deed in your name. Looks like that day&#39;s finally here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela froze, blindsided by the revelation. Tears welled in her eyes, her throat tightening. &#34;Uncle Josh, I...i don&#39;t even know what to say...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Phyllis can be a handful sometimes-always ready to throw a tantrum,&#34; Josh said with a weary sigh. &#34;But at the end of the day, she&#39;s still your cousin. Try to be more forgiving. When life turns rough, you two might have no one else to lean on but each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela could hardly picture herself ever relying on Phyllis for anything, but she didn&#39;t want to crush Josh&#39;s hopeful tone. She let out a quiet hum of agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relieved by her softened expression, Josh&#39;s shoulders eased, though a shadow of worry lingered in his eyes. &#34;By the way,&#34; he added, his voice hesitant. &#34;Is it true you&#39;ve been seeing... an older man?&#34; The brief warmth Gabriela had felt vanished in a flash. course not! That&#39;s just one of Phyllis&#39;s ridiculous lies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nevertheless, Josh remained somewhat skeptical</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He figured Gabriela was unwilling to admit the truth. After all, why else would Phyllis sound so convincing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, Gabriela&#39;s behavior was the result of his own past negligence, the lapse that had allowed her to go astray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice grew hoarse with emotion as he asked, &#34;Can you please end things with that man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A prickle of unease ran through Gabriela at the tremor in Josh&#39;s tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as expected, a heartbeat later, he clasped her hands and broke down. Nearly fifty years old, yet unable to stop the tears spilling down his weathered face, he choked out,&#34;|failed your mother. She asked me over and over to watch over you, and I...&#34; His shoulders shook, the grief raw in his voice. &#34;I betrayed her trust...I&#39;m so ashamed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s gaze lingered on the streaks of silver in Josh&#39;s hair, and she exhaled in weary resignation. &#34;I do have a boyfriend,&#34; she said softly, forcing a wry smile. &#34;But he&#39;s young and handsome, not some older man.Honestly, I&#39;m telling the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh only tightened his grip on her hands, tears streaming down his weathered cheeks as though her words barely reached him. He wept for what felt like an eternity, and it wasn&#39;t until Gabriela swore-again and again -that she would introduce him to her boyfriend at Phyllis&#39;s wedding that his sobs finally subsided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she&#39;d calmed him, Gabriela felt more drained than after an eight-hour workday. She all but collapsed onto her bed, sinking into the mattress, and was asleep before she could even pull up the blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sleep was deep and untroubled. But elsewhere, rest was impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys lay in bed with his fractured wrist strapped into a splint, every throb a hot spike of pain that kept him wide awake. By dawn, the mirror offered no mercy-his reflection stared back at him, pale, disheveled, and worn down to the bone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes burned with venom as he wished he could storm over to Gabriela&#39;s house and beat her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Haley Fox, Rhys&#39;s mother, heard about his injury, she got up at dawn and went to the hospital to take care of him. She set out breakfast on the table. As she urged him to eat more, she launched into a tirade about Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could a girl like her have enough influence to make someone break your hand? Well, she&#39;s probably sleeping with her boss. Girls nowadays have no shame at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice sharpened with every word, the flush in her cheeks deepening until she slammed her palm on the table. By the time she&#39;d finished, she had worked herself into a full-blown fury, vowing to march straight into Gabriela&#39;s company and confront her face-to-face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until she did, the bitterness in her chest wouldn&#39;t ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy&#39;s warning echoed in Rhys&#39;s mind, sending an icy shiver down his spine. He forced a tense smile and muttered, &#34;Mom, don&#39;t do anything stupid. I&#39;ve got it handled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s boss might be young, but the man radiated danger-someone Rhys had no intention of crossing again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, he&#39;d have to bide his time, watch, and wait. The next time he caught Gabriela alone, he&#39;d ensure she got laid-and capture the moment in photos to use as leverage against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That way, she&#39;d be utterly at his mercy-with no way out.</p>
