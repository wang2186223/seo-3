                <p>Chapter96 Reading To Wesley</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden mumbled in irritation, &#34;It&#39;s just one book.You&#39;ve got shelves full of them-why get so worked up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley didn&#39;t bother replying. He turned each page with deliberate care, checking for damage before closing the cover with a slow, deliberate motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lifted, sharp as ice when they landed on Brenden. &#34;From now on, stay out of my bedroom unless I say otherwise. No drinking in there, no touching my things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; Brenden said, still baffled. &#34;You never used to be this strict. Guess the older you get, the fussier you become.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s gaze hardened to steel as he retorted,&#34;Want to say that again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden instantly recognized the danger in his tone and clamped his mouth shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela lingered at the doorway, catching fragments of the exchange. She couldn&#39;t piece together exactly what had happened, but it was obvious Wesley was ripping Brenden to shreds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door stood partly open, and Wesley had already spotted her. She froze, caught between the urge to slip away and the impulse to knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley wrapped up his tirade at Brenden, then flicked a glance at the door and said in a cool, measured voice, &#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stepped inside quickly, carrying a glass of milk, the tension in the study prickling against her skin</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, she wished she hadn&#39;t agreed to Miriam&#39;s request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing her words tenderly, she told him, &#34;Mr. Moss,you barely touched dinner. I thought you might like a glass of warm milk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s expression softened, the edge in his eyes easing as a faint smile tugged at his lips. &#34;Just set it down here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Gabriela tried to make her quiet exit,having set the milk down, Wesley&#39;s voice froze her in her tracks. &#34;Hold on, Gabriela. There&#39;s something l want you to take care of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden wasted no time slipping out, seizing the escape while he could. He believed Gabriela hadn&#39;t come to the study just for Wesley&#39;s sake-her errand had been the perfect excuse to steal a few last glances at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet he had to scurry off and leave her behind. Facing Wesley head-on was enough to rattle anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, Gabriela,&#34; Brenden muttered as he fled, guilt etched across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left standing by the desk, Gabriela rested her hands stiffly at her sides, waiting for Wesley to speak. When the silence stretched unbearably,she broke it in a low voice. &#34;Mr. Moss, what would you like me to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley finally lifted his head from the book he&#39;d been leafing through, his dark gaze locking with hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, his eyes glimmered with a depth that felt both unreadable and oddly tender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything about him looked immaculate, and from where she stood, he seemed almost dangerously handsome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest fluttered, her cheeks flushed crimson, and her heart betrayed her with a sharp, unsteady skip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching her flustered expression, Wesley&#39;s mouth curved, and he let out a low chuckle as he extended the book toward her. &#34;Read to me.&#34; Her fingers brushed the cover as she accepted it, a jolt of recognition running through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t this the very same book that &#34;NotASaunders&#34;shared in his post?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did that mean both Wesley and Brenden shared the same strange fondness-being read to from this particular book?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Gabriela tried to steady herself, Wesley never looked away. His gaze lingered on her face, examining every flicker of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Gabriela felt uneasy, she hid it behind a facade of composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corners of his brows tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew this book-he was certain of it. Then why was she feigning ignorance?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The book&#39;s weight pressed into Gabriela&#39;s palms, its presence oddly familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps it was because she had once owned the same book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she flipped open the cover, her eyes landed on a name scribbled in the lower corner-Allan. She found herself wondering who he was. She flipped to the next page, and an unexpected illustration met her gaze: a saint cloaked in light, arms outstretched as though blessing an endless crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as her fingers reached to turn another page, a faint trail of sandalwood, cool and sharp like winter air,signaled Wesley&#39;s approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere shifted instantly, her thoughts scattering like startled birds in flight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Start from here.&#34; His hand closed gently over hers,guiding the book open to a marked passage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela lowered her gaze to the lines he had indicated for her to read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin,some in gloss. But every once in a while, you find someone who&#39;s iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s pulse surged, their close proximity sending an uncontrollable rush through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drew back a step, throat tight, then forced herself to steady her voice and begin reading aloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley reclined in his black chair, listening in slence,his expression shadowed with thought. The dim corner seemed to swallow him, his presence merging almost seamlessly with the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela noticed the heaviness in his demeanor and realized he truly wasn&#39;t in good spirits today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That brief sense of sympathy quickly vanished as her throat grew raw, each word scraping against the strain of two relentless days of reading and singing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two hours slipped by until her voice finally broke with quiet insistence. &#34;Mr. Moss, it&#39;s already very late.Maybe you should try to rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley shifted his gaze toward her, the depths of his eyes holding quiet displeasure, carrying the weight of disappointment that pressed heavier than his silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was frustrated. Wesley&#39;s stern expression left no doubt about his displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reminded her of &#34;NotASaunders&#34; on WhatsApp-always issuing demands, never once content with what she offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching her reluctance, Wesley&#39;s sharp look softened,and he dismissed her gently. &#34;You may go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped from the study as though fleeing an unseen pressure. The manor lay in heavy silence. The stillness pressed down until sleep felt impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts circled endlessly around the blind girl,Myah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind refused to quiet, pinning her awake beneath the weight of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When morning came,it was New Year&#39;s Day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the servants gone on holiday, the vast manor seemed even more hollow and deserted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela realized that since Myah had shown up,the entire mood in the manor had grown heavy. Even Brenden, usually so irrepressibly carefree, carrieda rare weight in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first day of the new year slipped by in uneasy silence. They exchanged a few polite greetings, but the lively celebration Gabriela had pictured never arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the second day, a summons from their grandfather compelled Wesley and Brenden to return home for a family dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela decided she would spend the day visiting Farley instead. Wesley arranged for a driver to take her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she reached Farley&#39;s home, she was welcomed by the sight of a table overflowing with snacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Happy New Year, Farley!&#34; she greeted warmly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Happy New Year to you too, Gabriela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley passed her a neatly wrapped gift, his face glowing with childlike joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t looked this cheerful in years, humming tunelessly as he bustled around the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the food was ready, the two settled at the narrow dining table, sitting across from each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although his dishes weren&#39;t exactly refined, Gabriela felt warmed by the simple comfort of his cooking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might not have been related by blood, but he was always kind to her-much kinder than Josh had ever been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Farley, Marie has agreed to move out after the holidays,&#34; she told him softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head bobbed in approval, eyes crinkling with happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela went on, her tone steady but full of resolve, &#34;My next step is to slowly take back my mother&#39;s company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, without wealth or influence, she had been forced to tolerate Marie&#39;s endless schemes. Now, with three million in savings tucked away, the landscape looked entirely different-she finally had leverage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She learned that Marie&#39;s assistant was both a gambler and a notorious womanizer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man with such weaknesses could be steered easily enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the inner workings of the Haynes Group weren&#39;t something Gabriela fully grasped yet. For that, she would need Farley&#39;s guidance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her plan, Farley&#39;s whole demeanor shifted.Determination flickered in his eyes as he leaned forward. &#34;Miss Haynes, just tell me what you need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bent closer, lowering her voice as she outlined her ideas. With each word, Farley&#39;s admiration grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela might look gentle and uncomplicated on the surface, but when she set her mind to something,she carried the same sharp edge and brilliance her mother once had.</p>
