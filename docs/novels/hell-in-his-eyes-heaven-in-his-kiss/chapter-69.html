                <p>Wesley&#39;s temper snapped like a dry twig.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his mood darken, Gabriela offered a gentle murmur. &#34;Don&#39;t take it to heart. Your grandmother only means well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth in her voice slipped under his guard,making his chest tighten-and, perversely, stoking his irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to restrain himself, he hissed under his breath, &#34;Fool!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she give in so quickly on something like this? What if she ran into someone truly malicious?She&#39;d be taken advantage of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing he disapproved of how she&#39;d handled things, Gabriela kept her gaze lowered and her lips pressed shut, afraid to provoke him further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta, catching sight of Wesley&#39;s darkening expression and terrified Gabriela might bolt,dissolved into tears yet again. &#34;Wesley, your mother left too soon, and I raised you under more pressure than you can imagine. Of course I want the boy l watched grow up to stay safe and sound. Now I&#39;m only asking you to spend one night in the same room with Gabriela, and you turn me down? That&#39;s cruel.I see who you really are now. I&#39;m so disappointed in you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dull throb pulsed at Wesley&#39;s temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stood frozen in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Down the hall, the servants slipped away one by one,unwilling to be caught lingering over their employer&#39;s private affairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Miriam seemed to savor the scene, flashing Loretta a sly, triumphant thumbs-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Wesley tongue-tied, Loretta pressed on.&#34;You&#39;re a grown man, Wesley. Quit fussing and get back to your bedroom!&#34; Without managing a single rebuttal, the usually imposing, self-possessed Wesley found himself herded toward his master bedroom by a storm of coaxing and scolding, punctuated by Loretta&#39;s tears and sharp reprimands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door slammed hard behind them, leaving Gabriela staring at Wesley&#39;s dark, unyielding expression, caught in a silence so awkward she didn&#39;t know where to look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on her, steady and searching. &#34;Do you know...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, he found himself falling fo her a little more with each moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she didn&#39;t return his feelings-she&#39;d once even mocked his long legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharing a room without any defined relationship-what kind of arrangement was this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his mood had shifted for the better, Gabriela seized her chance. &#34;You should take the bed tonight,&#34; she murmured warmly. &#34;Don&#39;t worry.I&#39;ll be just fine. I&#39;ve slept on floors more times than I can count, and I&#39;m used to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s lips curved in a cold, mocking smile. &#34;You really think I would let a woman sleep on the floor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela bit back any reply, deciding not to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pride was clearly at stake here-gay or not, Wesley wasn&#39;t about to let her trample over his sense of manhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she kept pushing to sleep on the floor, she&#39;d only be wounding that pride deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the thought of climbing into his bed left her uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, in a cautious murmur, she offered, &#34;Then...how about we both sleep in it? It&#39;s plenty big-we can stay on our own sides.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, with him being gay, there was nothing to worry about.Wesley&#39;s sharp eyes caught the exact calculation behind her offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood there like an employee negotiating with her boss-careful not to offend, unwilling to see him banished to the floor, yet too wary to outright challenge him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her indifference to sharing a bed-her utter disregard for him as a man-landed like a punch to the gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury surged, burning through his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; he answered, his voice edged with frost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Wesley&#39;s agreement, Gabriela felt the tension leave her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to sleep. Good night,&#34; she murmured gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d nearly drifted off earlier, but the earlier commotion had roused her. Now, her body felt leaden with fatigue. She removed her coat and slipped under the covers, ready to let sleep take her. &#34;Gabriela.&#34; Wesley&#39;s voice cut through the quiet,sharp with shock. &#34;What in the world are you wearing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night&#39;s slip dress had already been scandalous enough-skimpy but at least not see-through.Tonight&#39;s clung to her like mist, the sheer fabric leaving little to the imagination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thin straps perched on her shoulders looked as if they&#39;d give way with a careless tug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden, unwelcome heat coiled low in Wesley&#39;s abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization dawned on Gabriela, and she snatched her coat, fumbling to pull it back on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This slip dress came from Miriam. What&#39;s got you so worked up?&#34; she muttered defensively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t expected any trouble tonight, so the daring slip dress hadn&#39;t seemed like an issue. As Wesley&#39;s secretary, she wouldn&#39;t dare dig through his wardrobe for something else to wear. Who could&#39;ve guessed it would turn into this? &#34;Worked up or not, I wouldn&#39;t be into you,&#34; Wesley muttered through clenched teeth. &#34;Go change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela had nothing else to wear. The only option left was yesterday&#39;s curve-hugging gown-utterly unsuitable for sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley realized that too. With a weary sigh, he disappeared into the walk-in closet and pulled open the wardrobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything inside belonged to him, including the robe he reached for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his six-foot-two frame, the robe could have swallowed two Gabrielas whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, he came back with a crisp white shirt and handed it over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela changed behind the closed closet door and emerged a moment later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley kept his gaze fixed elsewhere, his voice clipped as he ordered, &#34;Get under the blanket and stay still. No moving around!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharpness in his tone pricked at her pride.Gabriela was a bit offended. Gay or not, did he have to behave as if she was unbearable?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it, Mr. Moss,&#34; she murmured, curling quickly beneath the covers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes ticked by, and still, Wesley hadn&#39;t climbed into bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, ever unbothered, drifted toward sleep,her lashes lowering in lazy blinks until her eyes shut completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after his pulse steadied did Wesley finally slip into bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was already out cold, her breathing deep and even, utterly oblivious as he eased down beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lay there in perfect stillness, face serene. With a twinge of disappointment, they slid the lock into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think this will actually work?&#34; Loretta whispered, doubt creeping into her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had expected at least some evidence of the fiery scene Miriam had so confidently predicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam, undeterred, lowered her voice but spoke with conviction. &#34;Gabriela is stunning-flawless figure,gorgeous face. If Wesley can spend an entire night in the same bed with her and still keep his hands to himself, then there&#39;s only one explanation...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the implication hang, the unspoken conclusion clear-he was truly gay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That possibility turned Loretta pale. She swallowed hard, clinging to the fragile hope that everything would unfold as planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning arrived in a wash of soft light. Gabriela woke up from the most peaceful sleep, her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lashes fluttering open-only to freeze at the sight before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp gasp caught in her throat, and she snapped</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her eyes shut, heart thudding. When she dared to peek again, the image remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley lay beside her, one arm draped around her in a loose, protective hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her relief, he hadn&#39;t wNoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s initial wave of relief dwindled quickly,replaced by a restless curiosity that had her sneaking in a few more covert glances at Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waking up cradled in the arms of her crush was a rare luxury-one most employees could only dream about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His embrace radiated a steady warmth, his scent a subtle mix of sandalwood and something darker,more intoxicating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in sleep, his sharply cut features looked effortlessly handsome, his lips pressed in a faint,alluring pout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a man-gorgeous to the point of being unreal.Such a shame he was supposedly gay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela started to shift, ready to slip away,when her body went rigid, and her eyes snapped shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait a second! Hadn&#39;t Loretta insisted Wesley wasn&#39;t into women?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then why could she suddenly feel the hard heat of his arousal pressed against her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lashes stayed clamped together, every muscle strung tight as she held her breath, pretending to still be asleep.</p>
