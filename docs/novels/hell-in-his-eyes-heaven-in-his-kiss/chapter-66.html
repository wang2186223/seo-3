                <p>The servants carried the two bulging bags into the backyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the far edge, a wide stretch of square-brick paving caught the sunlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After instructing them to return to their duties,Loretta crouched beside the bags and unfastened them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tops fell open to reveal a heap of fresh scallions,their green stalks still glistening faintly from the previous day&#39;s rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Gabriela stepped closer, Loretta bent to lift a handful, her hands moving briskly as she said,&#34;These are from our own garden, not dried yet.Yesterday&#39;s rain left them damp, so they&#39;ll need a few more days in the sun.&#34; She shot Gabriela a brief look as she went on, &#34;While there&#39;s still light, come help me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela agreed and mirrored her movements, laying the scallions out in an even layer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ache in her injured foot made each bend forward a slow, careful effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her sluggish pace, Loretta&#39;s brow furrowed.&#34;In my day, we had to work hard just to keep food on the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s cheeks warmed with shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t always been so delicate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories surfaced of the night before the college entrance exams, when Phyllis had deliberately poured scalding water on her arm in the dead of night. Even with a fever the next morning, Gabriela had sat through every test, gritting her teeth against the throbbing pain until the final paper was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d earned her place at the university she&#39;d dreamed of, slowly clawing her way out from und Phyllis&#39;s shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So how had she grown fragile over something as minor as a sprained ankle?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was because Wesley himself had applied the ointment, or because Miriam kept fussing over her, letting her slip into the unfamiliar luxury of being cared for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to shake it off, she picked up her pace, a thin sheen of sweat glistening at the tip of her nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you two doing out here?&#34; Wesley&#39;s voice came from nearby, deep and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crossed the short distance in a few long strides,his expression calm, yet edged with a concern so faint it was almost hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta cast him a brief look before answering in an unhurried tone, &#34;Can&#39;t you tell we&#39;re laying scallions out to dry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you give me a heads-up before coming?&#34; Wesley, ever patient with her, pressed.&#34;I could&#39;ve at least sent someone to pick you up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dismissed the offer without hesitation. &#34;I can make my own way here. No point wasting time and gas driving back and forth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she went on grumbling, Wesley&#39;s gaze drifted to Gabriela, noting the fine sheen of sweat clinging to her nose. &#34;Gabriela, go take a seat over there,&#34; he urged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his cue, Miriam promptly guided Gabriela to perch on the low flower bed nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta&#39;s expression tightened with irritation. She jabbed a finger toward Wesley and snapped, &#34;I only asked your secretary to help with a few scallions, and now you&#39;re upset about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona had even helped her earlier, pulling out a bunch together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley let out a weary sigh as he clarified, &#34;Her foot&#39;s injured-getting around isn&#39;t easy for her right now. Whatever needs to be done, someone else can handle it just as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta shot back, planting her hands on her hips,&#34;Do you keep useless people here for decoration?Everyone in this estate has their duties. She&#39;s sitting there knitting something as if she&#39;s on vacation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hot flush of embarrassment crept over Gabriela&#39;s cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam&#39;s kindness had lulled her into forgetting her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A secretary spending her day knitting in her boss&#39;s home-it did look improper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please be reasonable, Grandma,&#34; Wesley responded evenly. &#34;She&#39;s injured-she can&#39;t stand for long stretches.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta&#39;s expression darkened as she continued,you saying I&#39;m being unreasonable? Fine then, I&#39;ll go.I won&#39;t bother coming here again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never been fond of lingering at the estate,and even during New Year celebrations, her visits were scarce. This time, Miriam&#39;s casual mention that Wesley had brought home a girlfriend piqued her curiosity enough to come and see for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She intended to gauge Gabriela&#39;s grit-yet the girl hadn&#39;t even broken a sweat before Wesley began hovering protectively over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta began bundling the scallions, acting as if she were on her way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley,well-versed in her little performances, let out a quiet sigh but still stepped forward. &#34;Here, let me give you a hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could I trouble a big shot like you?&#34; she muttered, arching a brow at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just sittingin the study reading,&#34; he replied mildly. &#34;Not exactly swamped with work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scooping up a small bundle, Loretta peeled away a few wilted yellow leaves with deft fingers. &#34;Even the finest things need a bit of trimming now and then.Don&#39;t you think?&#34; she remarked. Wesley caught the implication in her words and answered in a flat tone, &#34;You&#39;re right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stayed silent. The sight of Loretta chiding Wesley while he responded with the calm indulgence one might show a stubborn child was startling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, the man she&#39;d always known as cool and distant seemed warmer-human, even-someone she could almost imagine speaking to without feeling intimidated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta remarked sharply, &#34;I&#39;m just helping you put your secretary to thetest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley pressed his fingers to his brow with a muted sigh before turning to Miriam. &#34;Miriam, would you bring me some dried scallions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta had always sent her home-grown ones to the estate, carefully cured in the sun until they were ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam returned in moments, a small handful resting in her palm. Wesley plucked one and held it out for Loretta to see.&#34;Notice how this one&#39;s wrapped in more withered leaves, the outer layers tinged red? Sometimes even the loveliest things need layers that seem needless,just to keep them safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With deliberate care, he peeled the skins away, one after another, until the tender white heart was revealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If not for those red layers, the fresh core wouldn&#39;t stay crisp for months-sometimes even half a year,&#34;he added lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta knew he was making a point, but still muttered under her breath, &#34;You&#39;re shielding her like this...do you have feelings for her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet sigh escaped Wesley as he responded,&#34;She&#39;s just a guest, for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta&#39;s frown deepened. &#34;I just think it&#39;s inappropriate-she hasn&#39;t even married you, yet here she is at your home...&#34; Wesley cut in gently, guiding her a few steps aside,&#34;Gabriela&#39;s an orphan. Her cousin got married yesterday and locked her out late at night, leaving her nowhere to stay. She was going to check into a hotel, but she twisted her ankle last night and couldn&#39;t walk, so I brought her back here. She works for my company, after all. I couldn&#39;t just abandon her to handle things alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, a glimmer of sympathy softened Loretta&#39;s expression. &#34;She&#39;s such a bright, lively girl. How could she...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice trailed off, the unspoken misfortune hanging between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s upbeat, compassionate, and competent at her work,&#34; Wesley stated, his tone calm but resolute.&#34;That&#39;s why I respect her-and why I chose her as my secretary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though unwilling to admit she&#39;d been too harsh,Loretta knew she&#39;d crossed the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept up her gruff act, but her stance had eased. &#34;Fine. I won&#39;t make her dry scallions.Happy now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Gabriela couldn&#39;t make out their words, she caught the flicker of irritation clouding Loretta&#39;s face and, in a quiet voice, offered, &#34;Mr. Moss, my ankle&#39;s feeling much better. I can help out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta shot Gabriela a sharp glare, masking her embarrassment over the false accusation. &#34;Why are you meddling? Just stick to knitting that scarf,&#34; she snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stared at her, momentarily at a loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley closed the gap between them in a few swift strides, lowering his voice so only she could hear. &#34;ls your ankle in pain? Can you move on it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes held hers, dark and unreadable, his tone deep and controlled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unsure what emotion lingered there, Gabriela answered swiftly, &#34;It aches a bit, but it should be fine tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make sure you rest it.&#34; His hand lifted as if to ruffle her hair but hesitated in midair before he let it fall, turning away instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole squabble over drying scallions ended under Wesley&#39;s firm handling, y/et Miriam still looked uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ushered Gabriela back toward the living room,then tugged Loretta into a quiet corner. Leaning close, she murmured, &#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me you&#39;d be dropping by?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted it to be a surprise,&#34; Loretta said with a knowing lift of her chin. &#34;And I need to see for myself what kind of woman has caught Wesley&#39;s eye and became his girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not his girlfriend-nowhere close,&#34; Miriam replied with a rueful sigh. &#34;Last night, I even arranged for Gabriela to stay in Mr. Moss&#39;s room...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly recounted the events of the previouS evening,ending with a weary shake of her head. &#34;He is over thirty, and he still doesn&#39;t have a woman by his side. Do you have any idea what people are saying behind his back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta pressed.&#34;Spit it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They think he&#39;s into men, not women,&#34; Miriam said,lowering her voice to an even more hushed whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cast a quick glance around before adding, &#34;I never dared tell you before, afraid you&#39;d be upset about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta&#39;s expression hardened as she countered,&#34;Don&#39;t be silly. How could he not like women? These rumors are nothing but nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta frowned. No wonder Wesley hadn&#39;t even glanced Fiona&#39;s way when she tried to introduce them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grandson she&#39;d raised with such care was attracted to men? That was utterly unthinkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam pressed on. &#34;Last night, he brought Gabriela home, and for a moment I thought that he&#39;d finally found a woman he truly cared about. But when a lovely girl like her appeared in his room wearing a slip dress, he didn&#39;t so much as reach for her, barely even looked at her. I called you here so we could figure out how to push things along between them.But instead, you showed up and played the villain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta was left staring at Miriam in stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And now,&#34; Miriam went on with a sigh. &#34;Gabriela probably thinks less of him than before. At this rate,he&#39;ll end up alone for the rest of his life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s bullshit!&#34; Loretta shot back, her worry flaring.&#34;Wesley&#39;s an exceptional man-what woman wouldn&#39;t be drawn to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, Wesley was flawless, the one who did the choosing, not the other way around. The idea of a woman not liking him was outrageous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam&#39;s voice dropped to a near whisper. &#34;But maybe...Wesley&#39;s gay.&#34;</p>
