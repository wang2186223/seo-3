                <p>Gabriela hadn&#39;t expected there to be other people in Wesley&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was dressed to perfection in tailored suits, their stern faces carrying the authority of seasoned corporate elites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But right now, those stern faces were all wearing shocked expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling awkward, Gabriela glanced at Wesley in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The think tank members also shifted their attention to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley, calm as ever, closed the file before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His normally cold expression softened slightly. &#34;Feeling better?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was nothing like the decisive, commanding tone he&#39;d used moments earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela couldn&#39;t read his expression. She nodded nervously, scrambling for a way to explain why she&#39;d fallen asleep on the job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aaron reached for the coffee pot, shooting a quick, puzzled look at Billy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What on earth was going on? They&#39;d only been away for a little over two weeks, yet Westey seemed different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy kept his posture straight, giving Aaron a subtle look that said to stay calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Aaron was far from calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After working with Wesley for a couple of years, he knew his boss had no interest in women. Not even the most dazzling actresses could earn so much as a sideways look from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet here was a woman, fresh from his private lounge. Aaron&#39;s eyes dropped, catching sight of Gabriela&#39;s bare feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d clearly been resting inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How close was their famously aloof boss to this woman, bringing her to work like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aaron and his team weren&#39;t in the office often, so they had no idea Gabriela had recently been reassigned as Wesley&#39;s secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following Aaron&#39;s gaze, Gabriela noticed her bare feet too. Embarrassment prickled as her toes curled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, she&#39;d made trouble for Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brow tightened. &#34;Put your shoes on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weather was cold. Maybe he should have someone lay down carpet in here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled by his sharper tone, Gabriela&#39;s shoulders hunched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d slept during work, taken over his lounge bed, and now the company&#39;s top staff had seen her like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would Wesley fire her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, she spun around and dashed back into the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her quick, fluid movement carried a natural grace that drew the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley gave her a brief look, then turned to Aaron. &#34;Is she pretty?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still reeling from the sight of his unapproachable boss behaving almost tenderly, Aaron blurted,&#34;Absolutely!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he possibly challenge Wesley&#39;s taste?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Wesley&#39;s lips pressed into a thin line, his voice suddenly heavy. &#34;You&#39;re so distracted by her that you spilled coffee all over my desk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aaron flinched as a scalding splash seared the back of his hand, yanking him out of his daze. Only then did he realize he&#39;d been absentmindedly pouring coffee long past full. He jumped up, fumbling for tissues, only to knock the cup over completely, drenching the documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scrambled to clean It, making an even bigger mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy and the others were speechless at Aaron&#39;s clumsy behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only minutes ago, they&#39;d been deep in a tense debate over a critical project, no one willing to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air seemed to hold its breath, as if waiting for something inevitable to unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Gabriela had stepped out of the lounge, and the entire room had lost its focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They said nothing,pretending it was business as usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley offered no explanation. &#34;Meeting adjourned,&#34; he said evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For them, that meant they could leave for the day. The think tank members rose quickly and filed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley surveyed the mess on his desk, rubbing his temples. &#34;You can come out now,&#34; he called toward the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela emerged slowly this time, shoes on, head lowered like a child caught misbehaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her a sideways glance. &#34;Sober yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded.&#34;I&#39;mn really sorry, Mr. Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you apologizing for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I shouldn&#39;t have slacked off during work, shouldn&#39;t have slept in your bed, and definitely shouldn&#39;t have interrupted your meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, resigned chuckle escaped him. She still didn&#39;t understand the real issue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley demanded, &#34;Will you drink that much again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he hadn&#39;t been around her today, she could have found herself in serious trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; she replied quietly. At least not when she was with Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her alcohol tolerance was usually fine-this must have been the wrong kind of drink for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley motioned toward the hangover tea he&#39;d set aside. &#34;Heat this up and drink it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela hadn&#39;t expected him to prepare this for her, and the gesture left her touched. It seemed he wouldn&#39;t fire her-at least not for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly brought the tea into the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s gaze shifted to Billy, who lingered at the edge of the room, all but melting into the background.&#34;Call my driver. Have him drive Gabriela home,&#34; Wesley said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she seemed fine now, he couldn&#39;t risk letting her take the bus alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir,&#34; Billy replied smoothly, though his mind was spinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The executive office was a hive of activity-year-end loomed, two major projects raced against tight deadlines, and annual reports poured in from every department and subsidiary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was so swamped they hardly had a moment to grab a sip of water, and even Wesley was practically living at the office these days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Gabriela had spent the afternoon sleeping, and now she was being sent home in a company car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a seasoned professional, Billy maintained a composed exterior, though beneath the surface, his thoughts churned in restless currents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After contacting the private driver, Billy turned to Gabriela with a courteous, businesslike tone. &#34;Miss Haynes, since you&#39;re unwell, Mr. Moss has arranged for you to be driven home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela quickly thanked Wesley and followed Billy out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only in the hallway did she whisper, &#34;I didn&#39;t... do anything inappropriate to Mr. Moss earlier, didl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her memory was hazy-she only remembered leaning on Wesley&#39;s shoulder as if it were a pillow, refusing to let go, and attempting to sleep on the kitchen floor before he carried her to the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest was a blur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her uncertain tone made him wonder-had she done something improper with Wesley without his knowledge?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You might want to go easy on the drinking next time,&#34; he advised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s heart sank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she had done something wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the company so busy, the fact Wesley wasn&#39;t asking her to work overtime could only mean one thing-he doubted her reliability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she fix her image in his eyes?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A $28, 000 monthly salary wasn&#39;t something she could replace easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her voice, she asked, &#34;I&#39;m actually feeling pretty okay, Mr. Clarke. Is there any work I can help with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your health comes first,&#34; Billy said firmly. &#34;Just rest and come in on time tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like hell he&#39;d allow Gabriela to work overtime after Wesley told her to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no other choice, Gabriela headed home, her mood heavy.</p>
