                <p>Billy darted out of the conference room, phone in hand,eager to call Brenden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word &#34;masochist&#34; still lingered in his mind-he&#39;d glimpsed it on Wesley&#39;s screen and had a vague idea of what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brenden answered, Billy told him that Wesley had summoned him, then hesitated, tempted to hint that he was in trouble. But Brenden didn&#39;t give him a chance to elaborate; he sounded downright pleased that Wesley was asking for him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Today&#39;s the company&#39;s annual meeting. Is Wesley summoning me to announce my transfer back to headquarters?&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden had been stationed at an Apex Group subsidiary-director in name, but the branch was barely scraping by. The so-called promotion felt hollow, especially with a dismal year-end bonus looming. A transfer back to headquarters would be the best thing for him right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to Brenden&#39;s bright, clueless optimism, Billy couldn&#39;t bring himself to shatter it. He stifled the truth and replied, &#34;Mr. Moss wants you at headquarters immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m actually close by,&#34; Brenden said, eager. &#34;I&#39;ll head over now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Billy returned to the conference room, Wesley resumed the meeting without missing a beat, his commanding presence effortlessly reasserted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy found himself quietly impressed by Wesley&#39;s composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before the meeting wrapped up, Brenden arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lingered outside the meeting room,leaning against the door frame with his usual easygoing charm, a cheerful note in his voice. &#34;Wesley, I...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish his words, every head in the meeting room swiveled in his direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden&#39;s easy grin faltered, his expression tightening under Wesley&#39;s ice-cold stare. The tension was so thick it prickled his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scrambled to figure out what he&#39;d missed-had he somehow offended Wesley without realizing it?Instinctively, he straightened and cleared his throat.&#34;Uh, did something happen? Who got on your bad side,Wesley?&#34; Wesley flicked him a glance from the corner of his eye, then calmly snapped his folder shut. His tone was perfectly composed, almost disinterested.new project in Claei Swea needs your expertise-you&#39;re perfect for it. You&#39;ll head out this afternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief flickered through Brenden&#39;s chest,though he remained wary. He forced a smile, hesitating as he asked,&#34;Sorry-where exactly is Claei Swea?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was in unusually high spirits about the assignment,treating it as a company-sponsored getaway. Still, a nagging sense of unease tugged at the back of his mind, warning that this trip might not be as straightforward as he hoped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching Brenden&#39;s puzzled expression, Billy stepped in to explain, &#34;Claei Swea is an island nation out in the middle of the Ottercroft Ocean. It&#39;s a volcanic chain -gorgeous weather,breathtaking views.Honestly,it&#39;s the perfect place to escape the winter chill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That seemed to settle Brenden&#39;s nerves. Puffing up with confidence, he nodded. &#34;Thanks, Wesley! You can count on me-I&#39;ll see this project through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Already planning to turn the trip into a mini-vacation with his new girlfriend, he pulled out his phone to do a little research.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the word Afluena appeared on his screen, he froze, convinced his eyes were playing tricks on him.After triple-checking, the truth hit him like a sudden jolt of electricity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you sending me to that desolate continent?&#34;he blurted out, still trying to process what he&#39;d just read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley didn&#39;t so much as blink. &#34;You&#39;ve been with the company long enough. It&#39;s about time you got some real experience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His flat, detached voice offered no room for protest,as if Brenden&#39;s opinion didn&#39;t even register.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden envisioned himself living in the harsh conditions of barren deserts and treacherous mountains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought sent him spiraling. Ignoring the row of senior executives, he all but begged Wesley for mercy &#34;| can&#39;t go to Afluena! The living conditions there are terrible, with unreliable resources and extreme weather. My girlfriend definitely won&#39;t be willing to go with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy couldn&#39;t help but find the whole scene ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than worrying about what might have triggered Wesley&#39;s anger, Brenden seemed far more distressed at the prospect of his girlfriend not accompanying him on the business trip After moaning for a solid minute, Brenden finally noticed that Wesley&#39;s face was as unmoved as a stone statue, and his heart plummeted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to surrender to despair, he remembered those chat logs Fiona had once shown him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If pitiful whining couldn&#39;t sway Wesley, maybe provoking his temper would work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation coursed through his nerves. Drawing a deep breath, Brenden hurled his last-ditch effort across the silent room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared up, shoulders squared, and barked, &#34;You jerk!You&#39;re unbelievable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy&#39;s jaw dropped, and a ripple of disbelief ran through the circle of senior executives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air went dead,thick with tension-every eye glued to Brenden as the shock registered in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he really losing it right in front of everyone?Calling out Wesley like that in front of everyone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Wesley&#39;s frigid stare was any indication,the chances of anyone collecting a year-end bonus were evaporating fast. Wesley fixed his gaze on Brenden, a flash of warning glinting in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed by the growing chill in the room, Brenden actually believed his little performance was having an effect. He squared his shoulders, doubling down with fresh bravado. &#34;Wesley, let&#39;s be reasonable here. Just transfer me back to headquarters already-I&#39;m not going to rot away in some backwater like Afluena!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The senior executives exchanged nervous glances and quietly shielded their faces, pretending they hadn&#39;t witnessed any of this train wreck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy,stunned and speechless, somehow managed to snap out of his daze to quietly signal the others to clear out of the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the while, he ran the numbers in his head, weighing the fallout if anyone caught wind of their CEO&#39;s eccentricities. If rumors leaked that the man steering a publicly listed company harbored strange tendencies, the stock would plummet overnight-maybe even vaporizing hundreds of millions in market value.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden&#39;s ignorance bordered on suspicious. Was he just dim-witted, or had a competitor planted him here as a saboteur?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s gaze turned glacial, his voice low and deliberate.&#34;What did you just say? Go on-say it again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frigid unease prickled down Brenden&#39;s spine, but instead of backing down, he doubled down and yelled,&#34;I said you&#39;re a jerk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words had barely left his mouth when a squad of uniformed bodyguards swept in and hauled Brenden out, ushering him firmly into the lounge next door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy&#39;s nerves jangled as he scrolled frantically through his contacts, coming up empty-there was no one to bail him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the blue, the memory of witnessing someone call Wesley a jerk on WhatsApp crossed his mind. If he could just track down that elusive figure, maybe they could help calm Wesley down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he had no idea who that person was, leaving him feeling helpless, reduced to silently rooting for Brenden&#39;s survival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A handful of nosy executives, certain they wouldn&#39;t get caught, hovered just outside the door, straining to catch every word</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden, born with a silver spoon and handed the general manager&#39;s job through Wesley&#39;s connections,had never been more than a meddlesome, bossy nuisance in their eyes. Now he&#39;d crossed the line by mouthing off to Wesley in front of everyone. They could hardly contain their anticipation, itching to witness exactly how Wesley would make him pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The muffled sounds of chaos from the lounge-a scuffle and Brenden&#39;s strangled yelps-caught the executives&#39; attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wesley, what the hell? We&#39;re family-why bring out a squad of bodyguards on me?&#34; Brenden wailed, voice rising in panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A solid thump echoed, followed by a sharp cry</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry! If you want someone to curse you, I&#39;ll do it in private next time-ouch, that hurts! Wesley,get him off me. My arm&#39;s about to snap!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the executives exchanged glances, silently agreeing Brenden&#39;s luck had truly run out, Wesley strode from the lounge, serene and unhurried,straightening the cuffs of his dress shirt with the poise of a man untouched by chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later,Brenden emerged, limping badly, his face battered and swollen beyond recognition-his self-proclaimed handsomeness reduced to a tragic punchline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then shot Billy a look brimming with resentment. Had Billy warned him about the brewing storm,he wouldn&#39;t have walked in blindly and upset Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy simply looked away, saying nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the sales department office Gabriela sat at her desk, growing increasingly anxious as the hours ticked by with no response from &#34;NotASaunders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could already sense the rumors ballooning,every minute of silence giving them more room to spiral out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey slid into the seat beside her, her complexion noticeably ashen. &#34;Word is, Mr. Saunders got called into conference room by Mr. MMoss and walked out with a battered face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suspected that the sudden beating Brenden received was connected to the gossip about Wesley being a masochist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered spilling the story to another friend in the company besides Gabriela and wondered if her friend would also face a beating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret flooded Aubrey&#39;s face; she looked on the verge of tears. Swallowing hard, she vowed never to gossip about others, especially when it involved Wesley. Noticing Aubrey&#39;s distress, Gabriela leaned in and murmured, &#34;Don&#39;t panic. I&#39;ll go find out what actually happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the perfect opportunity to ask Brenden for the real story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Gabriela.&#34; Aubrey&#39;s eyes followed her with a desperate, pleading hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela made her way up to the twelfth floor, nerves simmering as she lingered outside the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t catch a glimnpse of Brenden.Instead,she ran into Wesley, who had just stepped out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened and offered a quick, polite greeting.&#34;Hello, Mr. Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s brow creased in obvious irritation.&#34;Are you here for Brenden?&#34;</p>
