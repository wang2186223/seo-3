                <p>Chapter85 His Undeniable Charm</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Brenden sat a dish of baked custard studded with apples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The apples, thinly sliced and artfully layered,were nestled in a creamy custard, baked to a golden, firm finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless of its flavor, the dish was undeniably visually appealing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s lips tightened, his eyes turning cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clearly put in genuine effort for Brenden&#39;s breakfast, yet for him, she had previously made some awful greasy fried meat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware that his dish was a disaster, Brenden was so moved he nearly welled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since childhood, aside from Loretta, no one had shown him such kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Loretta and Miriam joined them at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deeply touched, Brenden declared, &#34;Gabriela made this special breakfast for me. Of course I&#39;ll savor every bite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scooped a generous spoonful of custard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant it hit his tongue, his pleased expression faltered, replaced by a grimace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so salty!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Gabriela emptied the entire salt canister into it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching her glance, he noticed a flicker of smug triumph mixed with quiet anger, and it clicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, Gabriela&#39;s affection had twisted into mischief. If she couldn&#39;t have him, she&#39;d sabotage him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, it was all because of his undeniable charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having let Gabriela down, he figured he deserved her punishment. Brenden forced down the custard, maintaining a neutral expression. With a bright smile, he fibbed,&#34;Gabriela, your cooking is incredible. This is truly delicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stared, at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t that much salt enough to make him wince?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her icy glare, Brenden fell silent but continued to choke down the custard. Leaning toward Wesley, he whispered, &#34;I think Gabriela&#39;s way too into me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley shot him a cold glance, saying nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden pressed on, &#34;This breakfast is overly salty,but it must&#39;ve taken her ages to make. She&#39;s punishing me with this because I couldn&#39;t return her feelings. Gabriela&#39;s such a great girl. Why would she fall for someone like me? I&#39;ve really disappointed her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He muttered as he ate, unable to contain himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His overwhelming charm demanded to be acknowledged, or his ego would burst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s fists clenched subtly, tempted to silence him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up an apple, he said casually, &#34;Grandma,Brenden&#39;s eating something this salty so early. It is not good for his health. He needs some exercise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Due to Wesley&#39;s past health concerns, Loretta was particularly attentive to the younger family members&#39;well-being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alarmed, she tasted the custard and found it unbearably salty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Brenden had already consumed over half.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta promptly declared, &#34;Brenden, after breakfast,you&#39;re exercising with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden protested, &#34;NNo need, Loretta. I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta was resolute. &#34;It&#39;s not up to you. If I say you need it, you do!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden respected Loretta deeply. Thus, he didn&#39;t dare defy her and reluctantly agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela silently admired Loretta&#39;s decisiveness. Well played!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, Loretta sent Brenden on a short walk to aid digestion. Thirty minutes later, he was to exercise in the garden&#39;s fresh air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Loretta turned to Gabriela, her tone warm.&#34;Is your foot fully healed,Gabriela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela nodded quickly. &#34;It&#39;s been fine for two days now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could you help me hang the New Year&#39;s garlands?&#34;Loretta asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s eyes sparkled. &#34;I&#39;d love to!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d never participated in such meaningful traditions before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This year, she could finally join in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pleased with her enthusiasm, Loretta turned to Wesley. &#34;You&#39;ll hang the garlands, and Gabriela will assist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s face clouded with a touch of reluctance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such tasks were typically left to staff. As CEO of Apex Group, was he really being asked to do something so mundane?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his hesitation, Loretta planted her hands on her hips. &#34;Well? Are you doing it or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley didn&#39;t want to upset her, so he relented.Sighing,he stood. &#34;I&#39;ll do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Change your clothes first,&#34; Loretta instructed. &#34;It&#39;s the New Year, and you&#39;re always in black or white.What&#39;s that about? Look at Gabriela in her vibrant red-so festive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s red coat highlighted her delicate complexion, enhancing her beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Loretta observed her, the more she adored Gabriela. She wished that Wesley would marry Gabriela right away. &#34;Do I really need to change?&#34; Wesley protested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wardrobe was almost entirely monochrome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Loretta insisted, producing a red T-shirt she&#39;d prepared. &#34;Wear this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s expression darkened at the sight of the T-shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under Loretta&#39;s firm gaze, he reluctantly donned the T-shirt, rolled up his sleeves, and began hanging the garlands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela observed in quiet awe as Loretta accomplished what no one else could-silencing Wesley&#39;s objections with a single look and bending him to her will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta glanced at her. &#34;Why are you just standing there,Gabriela? Go help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet satisfaction warmed her chest-she&#39;d engineered this moment perfectly. She hoped their relationship would blossom. Brenden, watching the scene unfold, was caught off guard when Loretta turned to him. &#34;Brenden, let&#39;s go.Time to exercise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He trailed her into the garden, quietly calculating that at her age, she wouldn&#39;t last long with exercise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To his dismay, a chiseled, forty-something man awaited-Cassius Padilla, a well-known personal trainer with over a million Instagram followers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His presence during the New Year was thanks to Wesley&#39;s personal request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden&#39;s confidence wavered. This wasn&#39;t looking good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta instructed Cassius to give Brenden a thorough workout, then returned with Miriam to watch Gabriela and Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley stood atop a ladder, with Gabriela passing garlands to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For novices, they worked in surprising harmony,their striking appearances making them a captivating  sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Loretta felt a pang of worry. &#34;Wesley is not interested in women. I wonder if Gabriela could work her magic and make him fall for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam&#39;s eyes sparkled with an idea. &#34;Remember that scarf Gabriela knitted a few days ago? What if...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hearing her plan, Loretta remained doubtful about its merit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam&#39;s schemes had never succeeded before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This time, it&#39;ll work!&#34; Miriam said confidently.&#34;Mr.Moss is not as cold-hearted as he appears. If he really rejects a lovely woman&#39;s advances...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta&#39;s heart skipped a beat. Would it mean he&#39;d never be interested in women?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry,&#34; Miriam said calmly. &#34;If that&#39;s the case,we&#39;ll use our trump card.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though doubtful, Loretta decided to trust her.</p>
