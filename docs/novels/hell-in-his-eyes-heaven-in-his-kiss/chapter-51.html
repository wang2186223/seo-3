                <p>The memory of Wesley&#39;s stern, unrelenting expression sent a shiver through Brenden. He couldn&#39;t endure the current situation a moment longer-he had to change it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he dialed Loretta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First, he charmed her with sweet words until her laughter filled the line. Then, adopting a wistful tone,he confessed how much he missed her, lamenting that his work in Afluena kept him from returning home for the New Year. He poured out apologies,his voice heavy with regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta felt sorry for him. &#34;I&#39;ll talk to Wesley,&#34; she promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden&#39;s spirits soared, and he showered her with more affectionate words before ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta wasted no time, immediately phoning Wesley to insist he transfer Brenden back. &#34;Wesley, you and Brenden are family. How could you leave him struggling in Afluena? The New Year is for family and celebration. I want Brenden here with me! If he doesn&#39;t come back, don&#39;t bother showing up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faced with Loretta&#39;s ultimatum, Wesley relented, and Brenden was granted permission to return that same day.He booked a flight home at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon arriving, he brought local specialties from Afluena as a peace offering for Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wesley, I&#39;m not good at digging wells,&#34; Brenden admitted. &#34;I swear I&#39;ll work harder from now on. Just please don&#39;t make me go back there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s gaze remained cold, barely acknowledging him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of unease stirred in Brenden. Recalling Fiona&#39;s words, he lowered his voice. &#34;I&#39;ve been watching videos lately, picking up some sharp insults. If you&#39;re curious, I could share a few in private...&#34; Wesley&#39;s eyes finally shifted to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That cold stare made Brenden&#39;s knees buckle, his confidence shrinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden pressed on, &#34;They say genius and madness are close cousins. You&#39;re brilliant, so a peculiar hobby is understandable. You don&#39;t have to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Wesley tapped the desk with deliberate force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out,&#34; Wesley commanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden persisted, &#34;Just listen-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Billy appeared, flanked by two towering bodyguards, who swiftly escorted Brenden out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden brushed off the humiliation of being tossed out. It was still better than being sent back to Afluena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smoothed his suit, feigning nonchalance, and strode confidently toward the company&#39;s exit. &#34;Mr. Saunders, please wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A clear, melodic voice stopped him in his tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning,Brenden saw Gabriela hurrying toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a certain elegance in her approach.Brenden felt a spark of excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela had heard of Brenden&#39;s return, astonished by Aubrey&#39;s accurate tip, yet quietly thrilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he exited Wesley&#39;s office, she chased after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped before him, her eyes sparkling with delight. &#34;You&#39;re finally back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden found it strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela usually gave him the cold shoulder. Why the sudden warmth? Could his time in Afluena, with a slight tan to show for it, have somehow boosted his allure?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mood brightened. He swept back his bangs,certain his hairstyle was on point, and flashed what  he deemed his most charming smile. &#34;Hey, Gabriela. I just saw you in Wesley&#39;s office.How&#39;d you end up on the twelfth floor?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela looked at him warily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the one who&#39;d snitched with screenshots,landing her in Wesley&#39;s bad books. Why act clueless now? But this wasn&#39;t the right moment to confront him.She had something more pressing on her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing a polite smile, she sidestepped the topic.&#34;Will you be available a week from today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seven days later marks the third day of the company&#39;s holiday, coinciding with Phyllis&#39;s wedding.Brenden&#39;s surprise only deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d rarely spoken to Gabriela before, and her sudden friendliness caught him off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then he thought of the young starlet he&#39;d recently started seeing, the thrill still fresh. He couldn&#39;t betray her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although a flirt by nature, Brenden had his principles.Two-timing wasn&#39;t his style.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a touch of regret, he shook his head. &#34;I get what you&#39;re suggesting, but I&#39;ve already got a girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Brenden&#39;s list of girlfriends was endless,and he never shied away from pursuing even the most aloof women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why, when she needed a favor, was he suddenly dodging her? Was he intentionally making this difficult?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly reassured him, &#34;Don&#39;t worry. If we run into your girlfriend, I&#39;ll clear things up so there&#39;s no misunderstanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She only needed him to pretend to be her boyfriend for one day. What were the odds they&#39;d bump into his girlfriend? But then a troubling thought hit her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden had too many girlfriends. What if one showed up at Phyllis&#39;s wedding? The chaos would be unimaginable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Brenden was already worried about his girlfriend getting the wrong idea, Gabriela realized she shouldn&#39;t press him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden thought he&#39;d misheard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela knew he had a girlfriend, but instead of getting upset, she offered to explain things to her if his girlfriend ran into them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she that into him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden wavered. He didn&#39;t want to lose the starlet he&#39;d just won over, but turning down someone like Gabriela was tough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated. &#34;Does it have to be me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his indecision, Gabriela realized she&#39;d need to find another stand-in boyfriend. She had heard of services where you could hire a boyfriend. With the right choice, it could pass convincingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden misinterpreted Gabriela&#39;s thoughtful expression as disappointment, stirring a pang of guilt within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out, intending to pat her shoulder in comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But a cold voice interrupted. &#34;Brenden!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound, Brenden froze, yanking his hand back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flashed a fawning smile and turned to face Wesley, who was approaching. &#34;Any instructions for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s gaze swept over Gabriela, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Moss,&#34; Gabriela greeted, projecting calm while panicking inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was in trouble. Brenden was likely still on Wesley&#39;s bad side, and sneaking out to talk to him could have put her there too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s voice was flat. &#34;Your forty-first girlfriend is in the café over there, Brenden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden wandered toward the café in a daze, only realizing halfway there that it struck him: when did he have so many girlfriends?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was as much floored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Brenden already had thirty-eight girlfriends. How had he managed to add three more after just one trip to Afluena?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder he backed out of his promise to pretend to be her boyfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Wesley was already heading back to the company,his very presence radiating frost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping out of her shock, Gabriela hurried after him, whispering, &#34;Mr. Moss, I only stopped to greet Mr. Saunders because I heard he was back.&#34; Inwardly, she prayed Wesley&#39;s grudge against Brenden wouldn&#39;t spill over to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet her explanation was a weak excuse to Wesley;he didn&#39;t believe a word of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of irritation flared in his chest.</p>
