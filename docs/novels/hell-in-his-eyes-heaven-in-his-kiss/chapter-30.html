                <p>Aubrey didn&#39;t press the issue; she simply let out a wistful breath, her gaze drifting away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once the New Year rolls around, you&#39;ll have your master&#39;s in hand. No wonder you landed a spot in the executive office. Makes me wish I&#39;d pushed myself harder and gone for grad school too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d spent years gathering solid experience at a smaller firm, but joining Apex Group meant starting over as an intern-her bachelor&#39;s degree just didn&#39;t carry enough weight here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela shrugged lightly, her tone casual. &#34;Honestly,I&#39;d rather stick with sales. At least in this department,I don&#39;t have to worry every day about getting laid off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given her impressive academic background, Gabriela could have gone straight for an internship in the executive office. Instead, she opted for the sales department,drawn by the allure of commission-based pay that promised bigger rewards than a flat salary ever could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the conversation continued, a burst of laughter rang out nearby-Tessa&#39;s signature, unfiltered cackle</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa found Gabriela&#39;s childish thinking quietly amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stint in the executive office mneant rubbing elbows with Wesley himself-an intimidating prospect, sure,but the networking alone was priceless. Even if Gabriela eventually returnec to the sales department the contacts and skills she&#39;d co ct would serve her for years to come</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Tessa&#39;s laughter, Gabriela and Aubrey turned their heads. Aubrey called out, &#34;Ms. Ortiz, fancy running into you here! Working overtime, are we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The workday had already wrapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa let out a weary sigh. &#34;I&#39;ve been absolutely swamped. Looks like I&#39;ll be clocking extra hours again tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At year&#39;s end, the executive office and finance department always ran at full throttle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa slid into a seat beside Gabriela and Aubrey for dinner, and once they&#39;d finished eating, Tessa reached over and gave Gabriela&#39;s shoulder an encouraging squeeze. &#34;Starting tomorrow, you&#39;ll be working with me. I&#39;m really counting on you to help carry some of the load. Let&#39;s give it our all, yeah?&#34; Gabriela&#39;s tension, and she answered with genuíne resolve, &#34;I won&#39;t let you down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s plan was simple: tough it out through the chaos until year-end, pocket her bonus, and then make her quiet exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a solid night&#39;s sleep, she a &#39;oke with her spirits soaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela never let grief drag her down for long: she knew how to shake off the weight and reclaim her strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She carefully applied a touch of makeup, fastened herself into a sharp women&#39;s business suit, and stepped into a pair of sleek heels. Instantly, she cut a commanding figure the moment she arrived at the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the elevator, she ran into the three women who&#39;d badmouthed her in the restroom the day before</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the doors slid shut, two of them offered wary greetings, their voices tinged with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, acting as though she&#39;d completely forgotten their previous friction, flashed them a bright, easy smile. &#34;Morning,&#34; she said, her tone friendly but confident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cali,looking visibly uncomfortable, mumbled a stilted greeting in return. &#34;Morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of Gabriela&#39;s icy fingers brushing her cheek lingered-so vivid it had chased her through restless dreams. She had no intention of provoking Gabriela ever again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator hummed upward-first swpping at the fourth floor for the sales department and then carrying Gabriela all the way up to the executive office on the twelfth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the elevator doors slid shut in front of them, Cali and the others lingered in the corridor, watching the elevator continue upward-leaving them behind on their usual floor. The gulf between Gabriela and them,once barely noticeable, now felt unbridgeable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of them could deny it: Gabriela&#39;s rise had been swift and undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the twelfth floor, Gabriela halted in front of the executive office, drawing a slow breath as she squared her shoulders</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced a quiet, defiant smile. Whatever happened inside, she could always walk away if Wesley made things unbearable</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to let anyone break her spirit</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her resolve steady, she rapped on the polished door. It swung open to reveal a bright-eyed young man whose easy grin radiated friendliness. &#34;You must be our new teammate, right? Welcome aboard! I&#39;m Jerome Cruz.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerome was a genuinely nice guy-the kind of easygoing that put everyone at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela offered him a courteous smile before greeting the rest of the team, her tone warm but reserved.Without lingering, she made her way straight to Tessa&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Ms. Ortiz. Is there anything you&#39;d like me to tackle first?&#34; she asked, her voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One moment,&#34; Tessa replied, fingers flying across the keyboard.She barely glanced up as she printed out a file and handed it over. &#34;Per the new memo, you&#39;ll be handling Mr. Moss&#39;s meals from now on. Billy will introduce you to him in a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela took the document, feeling the full weight of her new assignment settle on her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had braced herself for this moment. Wesley hadn&#39;t brought her to the executive office for a promotion-he wanted to watch her squirm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined not to bend to his will, Gabriela vowed she wouldn&#39;t let Wesley walk all over her, no matter what she&#39;d once felt for him. She was here to fight back, not roll over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa slid a crisp transfer form across the desk, her tone brisk. &#34;The executive office comes with a heavier workload and unpredictable hours. Be ready to stay late on short notice. Make sure you review the new schedule carefully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fingers grazing the paper, Gabriela registered the unrelenting timetable that dwarfed her old sales routine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as her gaze landed on the salary section, her breath caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The number nearly made her dizzy-twenty-eight thousand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela blinked, double-checking the three zeros trailing that figure as if they might vanish if she looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her salary had more than tripled overnight, blowing past anything she&#39;d made in sales, where commission always dangled on uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of adrenaline swept through her at the thought of her swelling bank account, and a quiet determination set in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this much on the line, she could stomach any</p>
                
                
                
                <p>us Salary hardship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let Wesley scheme and make things difficult; with this kind of paycheck, she felt unshakab&#39;e, ready to take whatever he threw at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy soon summoned Gabriela into his office, his gaze flicking over her with unreadable intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden had been shipped off to Afluena for some remote well-digging assignment, while Gabriela had just landed in the executive office, tasked with overseeing Wesley&#39;s meals and daily routines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The timing felt suspicious-too coincidental not to set off alarm bells. Maybe they&#39;d both been shuffled around for the very same reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An awkward silence stretched between them until Gabriela broke it, her voice steady. &#34;Mr. Clarke, is there anything you need me to handle right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything here was unfamiliar, every procedure a blank slate. She&#39;d have to build her footing from scratch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy snapped to attention, shifting into work mode.&#34;When Mr. Moss arrives, make sure you have a latte ready for him. No sugar. No ice. Understood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure thing.&#34; Gabriela answered, steadying her nerves as she took mental notes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy&#39;s tone turned brisk. &#34;There&#39;s a quick meeting at ten thirty-don&#39;t let Mr. Moss&#39;s coffee go cold.If you see the steam fading, swap it out for a fresh cup.no matter what&#39;s happening. And order his lunch ahead of time; the meeting may drag on past noon. He&#39;ll only eat from The Gilded Fork. Ask Jerome for their number.&#34; He didn&#39;t miss a beat as he rattled off more instructions. &#34;No spicy dishes, nothing overly sweet,and absolutely no onions or cilantro. He&#39;s picky-stick to his preferences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy delivered Wesley&#39;s food preferences flawlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tidal wave of instructions threatened to drown Gabriela, but the promise of a fat paycheck kept her afloat.Determined to prove herself, she nodded so vigorously it nearly became comical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After lunch, Mr. Moss will be heading out. Pack a charger,chaging cable, an umbrella, and a towel. For specifics, check in with Jerome. Oh, and don&#39;t forget -have a couple of brand-new outfits ready, just in case,&#34; Billy instructed, ticking off each item as if reading from a script. He finished with a brisk, &#34;Clear on everything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Crystal clear,&#34; Gabriela answered, flashing a confident smile. She prided herself on her sharp memory, but a flicker of doubt crept in. &#34;Wait, it&#39;s my very first day, and you want me to accompany Mr. Moss already...&#34; Her voice dropped, uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that really all right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy seemed to agree, but wit: Wesley&#39;s orders in place and no permission to accompary them, he had no choice but to step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela,still uncertain about Wesley&#39;s true intentions,pulled out her notebook and diligently scribbled down every one of Billy&#39;s instructions, her face earnest and focused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her attentiveness drew a look of quiet approval from Billy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Wesley strode in, fresh from the elevator-impeccably dressed in a custom black suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His commanding presence and sharp profile stole the breath from the room, leaving Gabriela momentarily starstruck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly replayed Billy&#39;s instructions in her mind and hustled to brew a fresh cup of coffee for Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning to the office, she found Wesley immersed in paperwork, his sharp gaze intent and his slender fingers dancing over crisp sheets. The image made her pulse skip, but she forced herself not to linger.She set the steaming mug beside him with practiced care,her tone respectful. &#34;Your coffee,Mr.Moss.&#34;Wesley didn&#39;t glance up, still scanning documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You saw the new salary. Happy with it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded without hesitation. &#34;More than happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That generous salary hooked her, driving her to fulfill every one of Wesley&#39;s demands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a low, knowing laugh, Wesley asked, &#34;Tell me-do I still strike you as the ruthless CEO type?&#34;</p>
