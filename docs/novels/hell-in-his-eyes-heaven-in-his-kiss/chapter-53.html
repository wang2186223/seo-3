                <p>The grating, syrupy voice scraped against Gabriela&#39;s nerves the moment it reached her ears. She didn&#39;t even need to look-Vivian. The same woman who had once tried to ruin her at Grace Robuchon by accusing her of stealing a necklace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela didn&#39;t bother to turn around and look at Vivian because of their grudges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sales assistant, still perfectly composed,offered a courteous explanation. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Miss. This is a limited-edition piece, and there&#39;s only one set available.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian let out a bright, almost giddy laugh. &#34;Only one set? Perfect-I&#39;ll take it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rare piece like this had been what she needed to give her brother and keep him off her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still smiling, the sales assistant shook her head slightly and stated,&#34;Miss Haynes has already reserved it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Vivian&#39;s gaze darted straight to Gabriela, her voice sharpening to a blade. &#34;And what exactly are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela slid her card across the counter, her tone brisk as she told the sales assistant to wrap the suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None of your business.&#34; She turned, her lips curling into a frosty smile. &#34;What-do you own this place now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment they were classmates in high school, Vivian had looked at Gabriela with nothing but disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Grace Robuchon, she had once falsely accused Gabriela of stealing her necklace-all for the pleasure of publicly searching her and savoring her humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But fate had flipped the script that day. Gabriela had been dining with her boss, and Vivian&#39;s scheming backfired so spectacularly, she wound up in custody for three days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally got out, her older brother had ripped into her, then locked her at home for a long stretch to reflect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today&#39;s outing was only possible because he&#39;d allowed her to tag along with Phyllis on a gift-shopping trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And of course-because life had a twisted sense of humor-the very first person she bumped into was Gabriela.What miserable luck!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a voice dripping sarcasm, Vivian drawled,&#34;Why is it that every time I step into an upscale place, I find you there too? So Phyllis was right all along-you actually bagged yourself a guy with deep pockets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swept a pointed glance around the store.where on earth is he now? Not here to swipe his card for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s lips curved in a sugar-sweet smile, though the chill in her gaze could have frozen glass. &#34;I&#39;m paying for my boyfriend&#39;s clothes myself-why would I make him pay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That smile was the one thing Vivian despised most,and the sight of it made her blood boil. &#34;Have you even looked at the price tag on that suit? That&#39;s a hundred grand-your entire year&#39;s salary, if that.I know you want to make your boyfriend happy, but this purchase will make every bill payment painful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone sharpened with feigned generosity. &#34;Tell you what-sell it to me for double. You can walk away richer, and spare yourself the trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s head snapped toward Vivian as she replied, &#34;Double the price?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely.&#34; Vivian&#39;s chin tilted, her smirk dripping with condescension, already picturing Gabriela losing her temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the tension could spark further, Phyllis stepped in, her voice sugar-coated. &#34;Gabriela, Vivian has her heart set on thatsuit. Why not let her take it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of bristling, Gabriela let out a short, amused laugh. &#34;Double? You think that&#39;s an offer? Bring me a million, and it&#39;s yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s mouth worked soundlessly, fury flashing in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her family&#39;s wealth was undeniable, but her allowance had limits. A million she could scrape together-spending it, however, would leave her nearly penniless for the rest of the month.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela arched a brow and turned to Phyllis.&#34;What&#39;s the problem? Your friend can&#39;t swing it?Maybe you can pitch in and help her out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis&#39;s brows knit together in disapproval. &#34;It&#39;s only that Vivian likes the suit, so why make a fuss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat climbed up Vivian&#39;s neck, her frustration making her voice sharp. &#34;Is your life really that pathetic you have to squeeze money/out of people?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not forcing anyone here,&#34; Gabriela countered, her tone deceptively light. &#34;You&#39;re the one who offered double. If that&#39;s still too low for me, I&#39;ve every right to push the price higher.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she let her voice drop to a mocking mnurmur that carried clearly through the boutique. &#34;If you can&#39;t afford it, maybe stop pretending you belong in high society. The two of you are utterly vain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The insult hit home. Both Vivian and Phyllis stiffened,their faces frozen in rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sales assistant, hiding her amusement, passed the neatly wrapped suit to Gabriela and said pleasantly, &#34;Miss Haynes, if it doesn&#39;t fit your boyfriend, you&#39;re welcome to bring it back for alterations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela accepted it with a subtle, knowing smile.&#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s lips curled in a sneer. &#34;What&#39;s there to be so smug about? Spend all you want-your boyfriend might not even be yours alone.&#34; &#34;Sounds like you&#39;re jealous.&#34; Gabriela&#39;s tone was almost playful, but her words cut clean. &#34;My man&#39;s tall, attractive, and full of ambition. He doesn&#39;t mooch off women like certain losers. Spoiling him is my choice,and I enjoy it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian barely flinched. But Phyllis? The color drained from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dustin might have looked perfect on paper, but his modest family background was his one glaring flaw.Gabriela had never let that slide, often tossing barbs about him being a freeloader-a humiliation Phyllis couldn&#39;t stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cursed Gabriela under her breath. In high school,Gabriela had been the perfect punching bag for every petty insult. When had that woman learned to biteback so sharply?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing down her ire, Phyllis curved her lips into a practiced smile. &#34;I can&#39;t wait to meet your boyfriend at my wedding,Gabriela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Vivian&#39;s mood shifted. Her irritation melted into a smug anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d already set the stage for some chaos-and she was eager to watch Gabriela squirm when the curtain rose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela had barely stepped out with the suit when Vivian&#39;s voice rang out behind her, pitched just loud enough for every passerby to hear. &#34;Phyllis,your family took her in and gave her everything without expecting a thing back. And how does she repay you? By obsessing over your boyfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, don&#39;t say such things,&#34;.Phyllis muttered in a voice dripping with false concern. &#34;She has a boyfriend ofher own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian let out a derisive laugh. &#34;Oh, you mean that so-called secret boyfriend? Please. She probably invented him out of spite-and now she&#39;s dropping a hundred grand on a suit...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela inhaled slowly, willing herself not to waste another ounce of breath on those two worthless scumbags. Still, one thing had to be clear before the wedding-Brenden&#39;s parade of exes was absolutely forbidden from appearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was paying a hundred thousand for a pretend boyfriend. Keeping a few women from causing a scene at the wedding was hardly an unreasonable demand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the thought formed, Gabriela&#39;s phone buzzed with a message from &#34;NotASaunders.&#34; &#34;Take the suit to company HQ tomorrow and hand it to Mr. Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden&#39;s antics rarely surprised her anymore, but this one made her pause. Had he actually made peace with Wesley? And now he was bold enough to rope Wesley into running his errands?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thumbs moved quickly over the screen.&#34;Your exes won&#39;t be showing up at the wedding,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several minutes ticked by before his answer popped up.&#34;Rest assured.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Gabriela tucked the suit into an elegant, ribbon-tied box and carried it to the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally placed it in Wesley&#39;s hands, a flicker of reluctance pricked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just fabric and thread-it was over a hundred thousand dollars in silk and tailoring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d never in her life bought something so extravagantly priced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the flicker of reluctance in her gaze,Wesley&#39;s lips curved in quiet amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for an elegant box beside him and extended it toward her. &#34;This is for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sleek packaging betrayed nothing of what it held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For me?&#34; Gabriela froze for a beat, blinking at him in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this unexpected present be Wesley making amends for that pitiful year-end gift?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low chuckle rumbled from his chest.&#34;Consider it a return gift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her anticipation collapsed in aninstant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A return gift from Brenden was hardly appealing to her in any way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She accepted it with a faint smile and set it down on her desk without much thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you going to open it?&#34; Wesley urged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll check it out at home later,&#34; she replied,her voice flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she moved off toward the kitchenette to make coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the process, an idea lit in her mind. Her step picked up, and she returned with the steaming cup in hand, placing it in front of Wesley. &#34;Mr. Moss,the gifts you handed out this year were incredible.Everyone&#39;s been showing them off online, praising how generous you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, Gabriela eased her sleeve back, exposing the plain bracelet at her wrist, letting it catch the light as she casually gave it a small wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley had more money than he knew what todo with. With the right nudge, maybe he&#39;d suddenly feel like giving her another gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley caught the cue instantly, his gaze lingering on the simple piece. A faint smirk played at his lips as he decided to toy with her. &#34;That bracelet really does look good on you.&#34;</p>
