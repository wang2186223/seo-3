                <p>A bodyguard in a crisp black suit addressed Gabriela with practiced courtesy. &#34;Miss Haynes, please get in the car. Our boss is waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise hit Gabriela like a sudden jolt, freezing her in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Brenden really get here that fast? Had he overheard everything she&#39;d just said?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly felt a twinge of embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Phyllis&#39;s sharp gaze lingered on the gleaming Rolls-Royce. It was a rare, limited-edition model-easily worth twenty times what Dustin&#39;s flashy BMW cost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drifted closer, straining her neck in hopes of spotting the man inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the tinted glass was pitch black; nothing inside was visible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air of secrecy only fueled Phyllis&#39;s suspicions.He had to be some seedy old sugar daddy. Determined, Phyllis tried to circle around for a better look at the driver&#39;s side. Instantly, two hulking bodyguards intercepted her, their stony faces radiating silent warning. With one synchronized step, they blocked her path-making it abundantly clear she wasn&#39;t getting anywhere near that car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis went rigid, her pulse skittering as the intimidating guards exchanged their stony glares for deference,bowing their heads and swinging the door wide for Gabriela like she was royalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bitterness and envy twisted beneath Phyllis&#39;s ribs,so fierce she almost mangled the polished handle of her purse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way a guy with this kindof money and devotion was some spoiled, cocky rich kid. He had to be a withered old creep, someone hideous and lecherous,right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite Gabriela&#39;s beauty, in the end, she&#39;d just wind up a discarded toy-nothing but a temporary plaything for some old, predatory man until he grew tired of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Phyllis, come on, quit gawking,&#34; Dustin murmured,slipping his arms around her waist. &#34;Gabriela&#39;s made her choice. All your worrying won&#39;t change a thing-she doesn&#39;t even want your concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis smoothed away every trace of jealousy,  slipping on an elegant smile as she inclined her head.&#34;You&#39;re right. I&#39;m a bit worn out. Let&#39;s just head home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dustin leaned in, his voice a gentle murmur. &#34;You really do need your rest. You know how delicate your health&#39;s been lately...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Gabriela barely spared the loving couple a glance. Their over-the-top act wasn&#39;t worth her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, she was preoccupied with something else.Once she settled into the car, she spotted Wesley waiting inside, which sent an electric jolt through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stammered, &#34;Um, Mr. Moss? What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After being stuck at the office all night and somehow winding up in Wesley&#39;s bed, she was still rattled, and the last thing she wanted was another encounter with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet fate, or bad luck, had her climbing into his car all over again, nerves tingling beneath her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s gaze flicked toward her, lingering on the exposed skin of her shoulders before a faint crease formed between his brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela couldn&#39;t read the subtle shift in his expression,but his voice was level as he queried, &#34;So, you&#39;re my  date for tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization hit her-Brenden had set her up as Wesley&#39;s companion for the evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given how detached Wesley seemed, she could tell he was unbothered by the fact that she had hogged his bed last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened, offering a polite nod. &#34;Yes, Mr. Moss.You&#39;ve got nothing to worry about-I will behave appropriately at the party.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the briefest nod, Wesley murmured a word to Billy, who quietly turned up the heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enveloped in the car&#39;s growing warmth, Gabriela mused that Wesley was truly considerate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attention slid to the coat bundled in her arms.After a glance at his watch, he instructed Billy, &#34;Take us to the styling studio first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away, sir,&#34; Billy answered, keeping his face stoic even as disbelief sent his thoughts reeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was just an intern, wasn&#39;t she? Yet here was Wesley himself, showing up to bring her along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the dress she was wearing--Billy had watched Wesley spend nearly an hour with the designer,making sure every stitch fit her like it was custom-  made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just last night, she&#39;d been working late alongside Wesley,and now it seemed she&#39;d already captured his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed Wesley was drawn to hardworking girls with quiet manners, never to spoiled heiresses who batted their lashes and expected to coast on their parents &#39;money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy kept his composure, quietly wrestling with his swirling thoughts as he navigated the city streets and pulled up to the styling studio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside,Gabriela found herself swept into the middle of a whirlwind, A small army of stylists, every one of them impeccably dressed, bustled around her with brushes and designer palettes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lead stylist grinned as he worked, barely able to hide his excitement. &#34;Miss Haynes, your skin is absolutely radiant. And your figure-honestly, it&#39;s flawless. I guarantee, you&#39;re about to steal the show tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela caught a glimpse of the studio&#39;s logo and,remembering Aubrey&#39;s endless gossip, realized she was standing in the very same place that prepped all the A-list celebrities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, this was just business as usual for the ultra  -wealthy: turning a simple banquet into a full-blown production.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the team finally stepped back, Gabriela barely recognized herself in the mirror. Her reflection shimmered-polished,poised,every detail immaculate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compliments from the stylists poured in from every direction, each one more flattering than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet beneath the glamorous transformation, Gabriela felt a twist of nerves. She wasn&#39;t sure she could handle being the center of attention at the party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley strode over, pausing for a second as he took in how stunning Gabriela looked beneath the soft lights. His eyes lingered appreciatively before he offered a rare nod of approval. &#34;You look great.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every trace of nervousness slipped away from Gabriela before she knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley had actually given her a compliment!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fresh sense of resolve lit up inside her; tonight,she&#39;d prove she deserved his recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, after sliding into the backseat, she couldn&#39;t quite shake her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s imposing energy filled the car, making every breath feel deliberate. Even after those handful of awkward encounters, she still felt small in his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached up and fidgeted with the delicate scarf,the one Wesley himself had ordered for her outfit, and tried to shrink into the shadows by the window. Maybe if she kept quiet, she could disappear for a little while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Wesley, seemingly in good spirits, glanced her way and broke the silence. &#34;What do you think of Brenden?&#34;</p>
