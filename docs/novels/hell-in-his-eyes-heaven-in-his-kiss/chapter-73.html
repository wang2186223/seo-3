                <p>Miriam&#39;s eyes narrowed as she watched Brenden&#39;s face flush for no clear reason. &#34;You&#39;re burning up! Do you have a fever?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden shook his head, forcing a calm tone. &#34;It&#39;s the wind. It&#39;s too strong. I&#39;m heading back inside.And the photos I took of these lovely flowers should be more than enough.&#34; With that, he handed her the phone back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam took the phone, scrolling through the photos and arranging them for posting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today, these extraordinary flowers would surely make her friends green with envy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what caption would hit just right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Flowers worth a mansion... So stunning, you&#39;ll be speechless!&#34; She paused, scrunched her face, and deleted it. Too flashy. Too desperate. She needed subtle, but with a punch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a grin spread across her face. Fingers flying over the screen, she posted: &#34;Captured by Mr.Moss&#39;s future wife herself. More priceless than the flowers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta, still a rookie at scrolling through social media, quickly liked the post and made sure Wesley did too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden slipped back into the living room,moving on tiptoe toward the kitchen door where the faint sounds of bustling activity drifted out. A mix of joy and guilt churned inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela was incredible! How could someone like her ever be interested in a playboy like him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes, being charming came with complications. Loretta, busy arranging the strawberries, caught snippets of Brenden muttering under his breath. She couldn&#39;t make out his words, but the expression on his face was a curious mix. Sometimes pained, as if he&#39;d just lost a fortune, other times shy, a small smile tugging at his lips as he leaned against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something seemed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping closer, Loretta patted his shoulder.&#34;Brenden, the sun&#39;s almost gone. Come help me gather the green onions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, Brenden straightened, composure returning, and followed her outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once there, he worked methodically, helping to gather the green onions and carefully trimming away the dried leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta stood back, quietly observing him, noting each careful motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you stay a few more days? Keep me company, and I&#39;ll cook all your favorite meals,&#34; she  Wrong Idea said,her tone warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure!&#34; Brenden replied casually, but a flicker of worry crossed his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spending more time with Gabriela was tempting, yes,but also dangerous. The longer he lingered around her,the harder it might be for her to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden couldn&#39;t help but sigh, feeling sure that his charm had made Gabriela fall deeply in love with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta, noticing the peculiar expression twisting his face, frowned. &#34;Is something bothering you lately?Tell me-I&#39;ll help,I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re so kind, Loretta,&#34; Brenden said, touched for a brief moment, before the weight of his thoughts spilled out. &#34;There&#39;s this wonderfu girl who likes me... a lot. But I already have a girlfriend, and I don&#39;t want to hurt her feelings. What do you think I should do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta studied him carefully, skepticism etched across her face. Brenden&#39;s taste in women was questionable, and he was constantly surrounded by gold-diggers clamoring for designer bags and expensive jewelry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could a genuinely decent girl really be interested in him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta gave a casual shrug. &#34;What&#39;s so difficult about that? Just keep your distance. Don&#39;t give her the wrong idea, and with time, it&#39;ll sort itself out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pang struck Brenden&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that really the only way forward? He felt an uncomfortable reluctance settle over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not ready to give up, he pressed on. &#34;How long has Gabriela been working here part-time? Do you know her well? Between Fiona and Gabriela, who&#39;s better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Loretta replied, &#34;Gabriela, of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden leaned in, curious. &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if the answer were obvious, Loretta listed off her reasons.&#34;Gabriela is prettier, better educated, brings good fortune to Wesley, and she&#39;s capable with a calm, pleasant temperament.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most importantly, she was the only one who could soften Wesley&#39;s cold heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden&#39;s chest swelled with pride. &#34;I thought so too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta, however, couldn&#39;t shake the uneasy feeling that something about Brenden&#39;s reaction was unusual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did he swell with pride when she praised Gabriela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what had he been so troubled about earlier,wearing such a conflicted expression-as if wrestling with some difficult choice?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta kept her observations to herself, turning instead to the kitchen. She decided to cook something for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the kitchen, Gabriela was busy putting the finishing touches on the soup. She looked up as Loretta entered and rolled up her sleeves. &#34;You should take a break. There&#39;s no need to help. Lunch will be ready soon,&#34; she said with a gentle smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m making something for Brenden,&#34; Loretta replied,just as a servant brought in a bag of fresh ingredients.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Brenden&#39;s name was mentioned,Gabriela&#39;s stomach tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next second, Loretta pulled out several portions of pollack from the bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she busied herself in the kitchen preparing the dish for Brenden, he was lounging on the sofa,reading Renee&#39;s text.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I miss you so much, darling. Why haven&#39;t you replied? Are you hiding something from me? If I don&#39;t hear back in ten minutes, you&#39;ll owe me a handbag tomorrow and an all-night cuddle when we sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The usual flirtatious banter, which once thrilled him, now felt hollow to Brenden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He texted back. &#34;Miss you to0.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bored, he tossed his phone aside just as Gabriela&#39;s voice rang out. &#34;Dinner&#39;s ready!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart skipped. Her words somehow carried more weight than a hundred of Renee&#39;s declarations of love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela set the dishes on the table, then noticed Wesley hadn&#39;t emerged. She hurried to his study and knocked gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; came a cool, measured voice from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The study was immense, shelves towering like a private library.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything gleamed with order. Spacious,immaculate and every detail reflecting Wesley&#39;s meticulous nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t at his desk, but reclining in a chair, absorbed in a book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A light gray vest over his shirt, a thick tome in hand,he looked effortlessly captivating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela lowered her gaze, and said with quiet respect, &#34;Dinner&#39;s ready, Mr. Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley closed his book, rose from his chair,and replied smoothly, &#34;Alright,let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Brenden was already seated, lounging as if he owned the place. It was familiar display of his usual careless charm whenever he visited the estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before him lay a plate of classic BBQ ribs, glistening and fragrant, the kind of dish that made his stomach ache with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Gabriela prepared this knowing it was his favorite?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he lifted his fork, ready to dig in, the ribs were replaced with a new dish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re eating this tonight,&#34; Loretta declared. &#34;This... what is this?&#34; Brenden asked in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta sat down beside him, a faint smirk playing on her lips. &#34;It&#39;s fish. Are you blind, stupid boy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden felt a surge of frustration. Why was he being scolded for this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s with that face?&#34; Loretta frowned. &#34;I put thought and effort into this, and you turn your nose up at it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden grimaced. He couldn&#39;t stand the stuff; even the aroma made his stomach churn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wesley knows you&#39;ve been overworking yourself lately,&#34; Loretta continued. &#34;And he suggested you have this for three days straight. Even if he&#39;s strict sometimes, when he shows kindness, you should appreciate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden felt a flicker of warmth and glanced at Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no idea Wesley cared so much. Wesley,however, remained perfectly unreadable, his expression fixed and calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mustering all his willpower, Brenden dove in and finished the entire plate of fish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela, watching quietly from the side, couldn&#39;t hide her surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each chew looked painful, yet he managed to clear his plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the quiet elegance of Rosemont Gardens, Marie&#39;s voice carried a sharp edge as she scolded Phyllis.&#34;You idiot! Even if Gabriela&#39;s boyfriend really is Brenden, you had no business inviting him there. Do you even know who Brenden is? He&#39;s Wesley&#39;s cousin!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis, eyes flashing with defiance, shot back,&#34;Vivian said Brenden&#39;s a notorious playboy, with girlfriends so many he can&#39;t even remember their names.&#34; She assumed Gabriela&#39;s connection to him meant little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what?&#34; Marie snapped, her patience wearing thin. &#34;Reputation or not, Wesley treats him like a brother and protects him. That alone makes him magnetic to everyone in the circle. And look what you&#39;ve done! Not only did you fail to embarrass Gabriela, you&#39;ve insulted Wesley. Gabriela&#39;s at his place right now, probably scheming how to get back at you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phyllis felt a flicker of fear, but it was drowned out by envy. &#34;I&#39;m not afraid of her!&#34; she declared. &#34;If she tries anything, I&#39;ll make sure no one walks away unscathed.&#34;</p>
