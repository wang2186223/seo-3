                <p>Chapter90 His First Encounter With Gabriela</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley ended the voice call, reached for a bottle of wine, and poured a modest half-glass before stepping onto the balcony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart condition kept alcohol to a rare indulgence,limited to the occasional sip of red wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gently swirling the crimson liquid, he leaned against the railing, gazing up at the velvet night sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A luminous moon glowed overhead, reminiscent of the one that had illuminated his first encounter with Gabriela four years prior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those had been the darkest days of his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gravely ill, with doctors issuing a grim prognosis, his usually carefree cousin Brenden had wailed as if the heavens were collapsing. fled,leaving behind a book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, she vanished, and he never saw her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four years later, she had come back into his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no need to hurry-after all, they had a lifetime ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley set down his wine glass, retrieved the book,and opened it on the coffee table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snapped a photo and shared it online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On Gabriela&#39;s end, the call had cut off abruptly. She fired off a message. &#34;Mr. Saunders, do I no longer need to read the book to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No response came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, she noticed &#34;NotASaunders&#34; had posted a WhatsApp status update.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d never seen him post before and had even suspected he&#39;d blocked her from his feed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity piqued, she opened it and saw a photo. On a balcony sat a small table, holding half a glass of red wine and a book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s lips curved into a pout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden, usually a playboy, revealed an unexpectedly romantic side under the night&#39;s veil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes sharpened suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The book on the table looked familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zooming in, she confirmed it was the same book she&#39;d been reading moments earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was open to a page with a wavy blue underline highlighting the exact line that &#34;NotASaunders&#34; had sent her earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But every once in a while, you find someone who&#39;s iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela magnified the image further and spotted her name scrawled beside the highlighted line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this her book? The handwriting wasn&#39;t hers. What was Brenden playing at?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scruinized the photo again. The balcony felt oddly familiar, but she couldn&#39;t pinpoint why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After minutes of racking her brain, she gave up and messaged &#34;NotASaunders&#34; again. &#34;Should I keep reading?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, no reply came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Wesley posted the photo, a knock sounded at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta stood there, holding a bowl of soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wesley, you&#39;ve looked exhausted lately. I made this for you and Brenden to boost your strength. Drink it,&#34;she urged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley sighed. &#34;I was just about to turn in,Grandma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since his previous serious illness, Loretta had taken to crafting all manner of peculiar tonics for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He appreciated her care but inwardly recoiled at the thought of consuming them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta fixed him with a stern glare. &#34;No excuses.Drink it. Brenden&#39;s already finished his. Don&#39;t make me repeat myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resigned, Wesley took the bowl and swallowed its contents in one go, wincing at the bitter taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when the bowl was empty did Loretta depart,satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The concoction left a warmth spreading through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering how he&#39;d cut off Gabriela&#39;s call,Wesley checked his phone and saw two unread messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she grown addicted to reading to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze cooled. He finished his wine and poured another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After three glasses, the heat of the alcohol spread through him, making his entire body feel extremely warm. He switched off the heater and leaned back on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he closed his eyes, the memory of that night surged back-Gabriela beneath him, soft and obedient, letting him take his fill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those intimate images replaying in his mind made him feel increasingly restless. He suddenly rose and headed for the bathroom. Even after a shower, the heat wouldn&#39;t fade. A dull ache pulsed at his temples,and drowsiness crept in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t felt like this in years, not since he began taking meticulous care of his health.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes passed, and instead of fading,the discomfort worsened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley got dressed and decided he needed to see a doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside his bedroom, Loretta and MAiriam spoke in low voices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just hope Wesley&#39;s body can take it,&#34; Loretta murmured, concern flickering in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miriam replied, &#34;Don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she decided the timing was right, she nudged Loretta toward the next step of their plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta glanced at the dishes and the bowl of soup she was holding. &#34;We&#39;ve used this trick before.Will it still work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me,&#34; Miriam said confidently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as their conversation ended, Brenden appeared,face flushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tugged at his collar, fanning himself. &#34;What did you give me earlier, Loretta? I feel hot all over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly is wrong?&#34; Loretta asked quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden hesitated, embarrassed. &#34;Just... warm.Everywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a good thing! It&#39;s a normaI reaction after having that tonic soup.&#34; Loretta shot him a glare. &#34;If you&#39;re not going to practice your exercises, then stay in your room and behave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking back to the day&#39;s training, Brenden&#39;s knees went weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, his muscles still ached from practice-he wasn&#39;t going anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Defeated, he returned to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Gabriela emerged from her shower and noticed &#34;NotASaunders&#34; still hadn&#39;t replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered, she grabbed her hair dryer, ready to go to bed after drying her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a loud crash sounded from outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly opened her door to look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her room was right next to Wesley&#39;s, and as she stepped out, she saw him standing in his doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hair was still damp, yet he was neatly dressed in a white shirt and black trousers, a suit jacket draped over his arm-looking ready to go out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression was hard, his irritation plain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta stood beside him, her expression equally displeased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela frowned as her gaze landed on the shattered plates scattered across the floor in Wesley&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela instantly regretted stepping outside, not wanting to get involved in their argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to retreat when Loretta spotted her.&#34;Gabriela,come here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering how Loretta had recently coaxed her into sharing a room with Wesley, Gabriela felt reluctant to approach her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she tried to think of an excuse, Loretta came over and lowered her voice. &#34;I just brought some food to Wesley, but l accidentally dropped the plates.&#34;Gabriela thought it was hardly worth fussing over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta went on, &#34;Wesley is upset with me. Could you please help clean it up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela nodded. &#34;No problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta patted her hand. &#34;Sorry to trouble you.I&#39;ll give you a gift tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If things went according to plan tonight, Loretta intended to give her far more than a gift-perhaps even Wesley himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stepped into Wesley&#39;s room and began gathering the broken pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes wandered toward the small balcony table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, then stepped closer. A half-full glass of red wine and an open book sat there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was no wonder the balcony in the photo shared by &#34;NotASaunders&#34; had looked familiar-it was Wesley&#39;s balcony. Could it be that &#34;NotASaunders&#34; was Wesley all along?</p>
