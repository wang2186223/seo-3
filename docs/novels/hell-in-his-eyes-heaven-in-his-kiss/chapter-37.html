                <p>A heavy mood lingered in the office, a hush settling over the space like a fog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley abruptly looked up, his eyes shadowed with layersof emotion that revealed nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fixed Gabriela with a penetrating stare. &#34;Are you unhappy with my decision?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela responded instantly, shaking her head in denial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She prided herself on her sense of fairness-she always drew a clear line between right and wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Wesley had cut her pay, she knew the real culprit was Fiona, who had stirred up the trouble in the first place. Gabriela fully intended to make Fiona pay for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, she had already crafted the perfect plan to turn the tables. Next time Fiona tried anything,she&#39;d find out exactly what it felt like to be on the losing side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Gabriela&#39;s willingness to admit fault and the way she&#39;d swiftly dealt with the bouquet, Wesley&#39;s sternness eased. &#34;Since this is your first mistake, I&#39;ll let it slide-no salary deduction,&#34; he stated, voice smooth and controlled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela hadn&#39;t dared hope for this outcome. Relief and gratitude brightened her face, her eyes shining like jewels as she offered a sincere thanks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley forced himself to look &#39;away, maintaining his composure. &#34;Starting today, you&#39;re in charge of my lunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cooking was second nature to Gabriela, but she worried about squeezing it into her packed schedule. Still,she nodded, determined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can use the kitchen here,&#34; Wesley added, gesturing toward the glass door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Gabriela recall the private kitchen adjoining his office. She assured him that his meals would always be up to standard. Watching the scene unfold, Billy stood frozen, too stunned to say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, he felt certain-Gabriela held a unique place in Wesley&#39;s world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasted no time lingering, hustling Wesley through the morning&#39;s urgent signatures before making a discreet exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the clock struck eleven, a delivery of crisp produce arrived, and Gabriela hurried into the kitchen, her determination palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She poured her energy into preparing a handful of classic comfort dishes, finishing with a steaming pot of borscht, intent on impressing Wesley with every detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At twelve-ten, her phone buzzed. Aubrey&#39;s cheerful voice crackled through. &#34;Gabriela, I grabbed us a table!When are you heading over? Want me to pick up your lunch?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reserving a seat in the company cafeteria had become a silent ritual between them-whoever got there first always saved a spot, an unspoken promise in the bustle of company life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela replied, &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;mnot eating in the cafeteria today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey blinked, curiosity bubbling in her voice. &#34;Oh? Got lunch plans with Mr. Moss again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly grin, Gabriela explained, &#34;Not quite. I&#39;m doubling as his personal chef now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey&#39;s eyes widened, her excitement impossible to contain. &#34;Wait, you&#39;re seriously cooking for him?Gabriela,that&#39;s huge!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who could have guessed that culinary skills might actually pave the way to career advancement?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey found herself tempted to sharpen her culinary skills, while Gabriela couldn&#39;t have been more indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Gabriela hadn&#39;t felt compelled to repay Wesley for that outrageously pricey outfit, she wouldn&#39;t be juggling two jobs right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Aubrey&#39;s loud words drifted over to the three colleagues at the next table-ironically, the same ones who&#39;d trashed Gabriela&#39;s name in the restroom days ago. Now, every ounce of color had drained from their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela,actually cooking for Wesley? She had really caught his eye lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just thinking about their own careless gossip, each of them squirmed with embarrassment,especially Cali,who felt an icy sweat break out as dread snaked its way down her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody could say how long Gabriela&#39;s good fortune would last, but for now, her approval from Wesley meant any of them could be out if she just said the word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to Gabriela, her new job as Wesley&#39;s personal chef had put those three colleagues on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She arranged the lunch spread-a platter of smoky barbecue ribs, tender steamed cod, a hearty pot of borscht, and a colorful sauté of fresh vegetables-making sure everything looked inviting before she called Wesley in to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took his seat, eyes landing on the borscht. For the first time, a subtle smile touched his lips. &#34;This actually looks normal today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering her seasoning mishap from last time, Gabriela flushed, guilt prickling at her cheeks. &#34;I&#39;ve made a note of everything you like, Mr. Moss. You won&#39;t find a single ingredient you dislike from now on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley, visibly satisfied, gestured for her to take a seat beside him at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela wavered, her voice barely above a whisper. &#34;I...I really shouldn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every instinct warned her that sharing a meal with Wesley was a gamble. His temperament could shift in an instant, and she knew better than to presume too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley had a knack for bending her will to match his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned back, an amused glint in his eyes. &#34;Dinner won&#39;t start until someone samples the dishes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela stared at him, stunned into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a man like Wesley Moss could turn an ordinary meal into such a spectacle. If he was so afraid of being poisoned, why put her in charge of his meals in the first place?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding into her seat, Gabriela took a careful bite from each dish, finishing them all in a matter of moments.She met Wesley&#39;s gaze with a bright, earnest smile. &#34;You have nothing to worry about, Mr. Moss. Everything I make is perfectly safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley seemed pleased, nodding his approval. &#34;In tha case, let&#39;s eat together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, Gabriela had morphed from a reluctant chef into to an impromptu food taster and Wesley&#39;s unwilling lunch companion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could hardly keep track of how many roles she&#39;d filled for him already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was because lunch turned out just the way Wesley liked it, and he didn&#39;t give her a single hard time for the rest of the day. Before she knew it, the workday was over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, she didn&#39;t have to stay late. As she left the office right at six, a wave of pure relief nearly sent her skipping down the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brief burst of joy evaporated almost instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There he was-the man from her ill-fated blind date-was propped up against a gleaming white Audi at the curb, clutching a bouquet of roses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hit Gabriela all at once. The mysterious bouquet she&#39;d received that morning-those gaudy red roses-had been from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of his slick pickup lines made her lips tighten in distaste. She veered sharply, determined to sidestep him entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No such luck. Rhys spotted her right away, waving the flowers like a flag. With her striking features and magnetic energy, Gabriela drew every pair of eyes on the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys strode up, a smug grin on his face, and called out, &#34;Gabriela, done for the day? I&#39;ve been standing here ages! Did those roses I sent brighten your morning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He acted as if she&#39;d personally invited him to wait, his voice dripping with an insistent familiarityGabriela&#39;s irritation simmered while curious colleagues snuck glances, their whispersblending into a low hum behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She edged away, holding her chin high. &#34;I&#39;m afraid we&#39;re not that close, Mr. Fox. It&#39;s Miss Haynes to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys closed the gap, brandishing a bright smile. &#34;Feeling shy, are you, Gabriela? Honestly, both our families are thrilled about us. Phyllis couldn&#39;t stop talking about how much you love roses. That&#39;s why I went out of my way to get these white ones for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys pressed the bouquet insistently toward her, but Gabriela sidestepped with a brisk shake of her head.&#34;I&#39;m afraid roses aren&#39;t my thing. Why don&#39;t you let the trash can enjoy them instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition flickered across Rhys&#39;s face as the truth hit him-she had tossed the pricey bouquet he&#39;d sent that morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d dropped a small fortune on those flowers!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization soured his expression, frustration knotting his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who do you think you are?&#34; he snapped, his voice rising. &#34;Don&#39;t go thinking you&#39;re so special. Being pretty doesn&#39;t mean every guy is desperate to chaseafter you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s jaw tightened, her patience snapping. &#34;Then get out of my sight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys barked out a stunned laugh. &#34;You seriously think you can talk to me like that?&#34; He squared his shoulders, eyes flashing. &#34;Your family practically begged me to give you a chance, pleading with me not to write you off! I only bothered to&#39;show up as a favor to Phyllis-she and I go way back to college. Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t have wasted my time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped in close, voice rising. &#34;Your family already agreed to us. Whether you want it or not, you&#39;re leaving with me today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, Rhys agreed just to indulge&#39;his flattered ego, but Gabriela&#39;s beauty kept replaying in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,the decision was made. He wasn&#39;t going to back down. As far as he was concerned, the blind date and her family&#39;s approval gave him every right. No one else got a say. Without warning, Rhys seized Gabriela&#39;s arm in a bruising grip and tried to haul her toward his car.</p>
