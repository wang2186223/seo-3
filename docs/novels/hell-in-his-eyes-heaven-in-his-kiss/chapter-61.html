                <p>Billy&#39;s hands shook with unease. Could he have gotten it all wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible that Wesley didn&#39;t harbor any romantic feelings for Gabriela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that were true, then what explained his relentless push in Athea these last few days?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long beat, Billy hovered in doubt, uncertain whether to pass the boutique over to Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By this point, any trace of tension had long drained from Wesley&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the CEO of Apex Group, he wasn&#39;t the kind of man to crack under embarrassment over something as insignificant as a failed love confession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Composure was second nature to him, and now was to steer things toward a calmer, more sustainable footing between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Burying every flicker of emotion behind a cool gaze,he addressed Gabriela evenly. &#34;I think you&#39;ve got the wrong idea. Women like you don&#39;t interest me in the least. The only reason I brought you here...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela held her breath, mortified by her blunder, as Wesley continued in a flat and mechanical tone,&#34;Was to ask if you wanted to hang around and watch Billy propose to his girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy, who had been single for years, went rigid,caught completely off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of his adult life had been swallowed by the relentless grind of working for Wesley-through crises, tight deadlines, and endless business trips-leaving little time to even think about dating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, how on earth was he supposed to conjure up a girlfriend out of nowhere?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s shoulders loosened as a faint sigh of relief slipped out. But her surprise quickly shifted to incredulous amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously? Wesley cared about something like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, even the most imposing man had a taste for juicy gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she turned, her gaze caught Billy with an enormous bouquet of red roses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, watching a live proposal was far more entertaining than scrolling through some over-the-top drama series.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy, looking like a man headed for the gallows,darted a glance at Wesley-only to be met with an icy stare that all but said, &#34;Want me to assign you to a nightmare project with Brenden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The implied threat made his knees wobble, but Billy swallowed hard and forced himself to address Gabriela. &#34;Well, what a pleasant surprise to see you here, Miss Haynes. So...do you think I have any shot at pulling this proposal off?&#34;  Gabriela knew him as a relentless workaholic, a man who married deadlines instead of romance. Yet today, he was suddenly playing the part of a lovestruck man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flashed him a quick, encouraging fist bump.&#34;You&#39;ve got this. Go knock her off her feet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Appreciate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Squaring his shoulders, Billy turned toward the distance with exaggerated drama, as if his girlfriend might appear at any moment, stepping right into his carefully staged scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, drizzle clung to his hair and soaked through his jacket, leaving him shivering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s playful curiosity faded, replaced by quiet sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Poor guy-after all that careful preparation, his girlfriend hadn&#39;t even shown. Had she actually stood him up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy risked a sideways glance toward them, no doubt  checking if Wesley&#39;s anger had simmered down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching his disheartened expression, Gabriela felt a twinge of sympathy and offered gently, &#34;Don&#39;t let it get to you, Mr. Clarke. Maybe the rain&#39;s what kept her away. You&#39;re good-looking and have a solid paycheck. A lot of the women at work think you&#39;re a catch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s expression, however, only grew a shade darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy stiffened under Wesley&#39;s cold, cutting stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her attempt at cheer only deepened the slump in his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up on it, Gabriela pressed on, her voice light but teasing. &#34;Sure, fireworks and roses are sweet,but they&#39;re also a total cliché. You&#39;d make a bigger impression by sliding her an unlimited credit card and telling her to use it however she wants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The absurdity hit her a beat later, and she waved her hands in quick retreat. &#34;Alright, maybe that would just blow the whole thing up and make her angrier.Honestly, the real problem is you don&#39;t even have a ring. Show up with one next time, and she won&#39;t be able to turn you down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words instantly soured Wesley&#39;s mood, as those things she mentioned should have been prepared,yet he hadn&#39;t arranged any of them at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression tightened, and with a sharp tug at his tie,he pivoted and strode away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela leaned toward Billy, murmuring a quick word of encouragement, then quickened her pace to catch up with Wesley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He threw her a sidelong glance as he pressed.&#34;What&#39;s this-planning to come home with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a small shake of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in his clipped tone told her he was in a foul mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible the deal in Athea had fallen through? Trying to be a thoughtful subordinate, Gabriela held back from trailing after him, not wanting to push his temper any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley had gone only a few strides when the absence of footsteps made him glance over his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lingered in place, eyes wide and uncertain, like a stray kitten left out in the rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in him eased at the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His unmet desire wasn&#39;t her burden to bear. What sense was there in taking out his frustration on her for that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppressing a sigh, he said, &#34;I&#39;ll take you home fist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a hesitant whisper, Gabriela inquired, &#34;What about Mr. Clarke? Shouldn&#39;t webring him along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold bit through the air, and the rain was falling harder by the minute. She doubted Billy&#39;s girlfriend would ever appear.  Wesley let out a dry snort. &#34;He&#39;s still waiting on his girlfriend. Planning to stick around and wait with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy quickly cut in, &#34;Miss Haynes, you should go ahead with Mr. Moss. I&#39;ll wait here a little longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he knew his so-called girlfriend would never show up because she didn&#39;t exist at all, he had to maintain the facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive back to Rosemont Gardens passed in heavy, unbroken silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they arrived, Gabriela found the door locked,and repeated calls to Josh went unanswered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wedding was probably still underway, and Josh was no doubt occupied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s brows drew together as he watched her make call after call with no answer. &#34;You don&#39;t have a key?&#34; She actually lived here without one?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she often end up stranded like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s usually Ken who lets me in, but he&#39;s helping at the hotel right now,&#34; Gabriela murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away, she felt a small wave of gloom settle over her. It looked like she&#39;d be paying for another hotel room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pivoted too quickly, frustration tugging at her focus, and her heel slipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley caught her before she fell, but the left heel of her shoe snapped, sending a sharp twist through her ankle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft cry escaped before she could stifle it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though a flicker of concern crossed his mind,he masked it, keeping his voice even. &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela tilted her face up, forcing a faint smile. &#34;It&#39;s nothing.&#34; She&#39;d already made a fool of herself earlier-no way was she letting him think she was so hopeless she could injure herself just walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of a sudden, Wesley bent down and scooped her into his arms in one smooth motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her feet left the ground so suddenly that instinct had her looping her arms around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can walk by myself, Mr. Moss,&#34; she protested, her voice quick and flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s expression stayed impassive as he remarked, &#34;Don&#39;t read into it. I don&#39;t have feelings for you. I&#39;m just making sure you won&#39;t aggravate your sprain to the point where you&#39;ll have to hobble into work and force the company to assign someone to babysit you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bluntness left her momentarily speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, whatever she&#39;d imagined back at the beach -that fleeting, ridiculous thought he might actually like her-had been nothing but afoolish fantasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley slid Gabriela into the passenger seat and pulled onto the road without missing a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could you just drop me at the nearest hotel, Mr.Moss?&#34; she blurted out hastily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping up his facade as the attentive boss, he replied, &#34;Let me see if any hotels still have vacancies tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out his phone, he made a quick call. Ten minutes later, he said evenly, &#34;I had Billy check.Every nearby hotel is already full.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela&#39;s brows drew together. That didn&#39;t make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the holiday season-shouldn&#39;t most people be at home with their families? How could the hotels be overflowing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she blinked in surprise. &#34;Hold on-Mr. Clarke&#39;s still at the beach, isn&#39;t he? Waiting for his girlfriend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the briefest moment, Wesley&#39;s composure slipped, but he quickly smoothed it over. &#34;She turned him down-said fireworks and roses were tacky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Billy had not only pulled holiday overtime but also endured a doomed proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Poor Billy,&#34; Gabriela murmured, a faint note of sympathy threading her voice. &#34;All that charm and money,yet he&#39;s unlucky in love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her, Wesley-wealthy, magnetic, and fresh from his own failed love confession-kept silent,though his jaw tightened almost imperceptibly.</p>
