                <p>Chapter98 Brenden Isn&#39;t An Outsider</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s face hardened as he cast a sharp glance at Davion and declared, &#34;Though Brenden is a Saunders,he isn&#39;t an outsider. He&#39;s my cousin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words showed his support for Brenden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davion didn&#39;t dare challenge Wesley outright, but noticing Brenden&#39;s silence, he pressed further. &#34;I heard you were shipped off to Afluena, Brenden. What did you do to mess up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howard Moss, unafraid of Brenden though wary of Wesley, chimed in quickly, &#34;Brenden&#39;s quite the playboy,probably too busy chasing women to care about work. No wonder Wesley, who doesn&#39;t tolerate incompetence,sent him packing in frustration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A young woman from a distant branch of the Moss family snickered, adding, &#34;I heard that place is grimy.Brenden must have endured a lot there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few more taunts, Davion turned to Wesley, his voice laced with mockery. &#34;Wesley, Brenden has never been good for anything. Only you would waste time on a leech like him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their blatant ridicule, coupled with subtle attempts to drive a wedge between Brenden and Wesley, struck the former hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he was usually thick-skinned, the cruel words cut deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aware of his own shortcomings, he stayed quiet, not wanting to burden Wesley further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the younger Moss family members were present, and seeing Brenden bow his head only made them look down on him all the more, as if he were nothing more than a pitiful fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then,Brenden&#39;s father,Graham Moss,approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He merely frowned at the harsh taunts. To him,Brenden was a source of shame, and he made no effort to defend him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden looked at him, a flicker of hope in his eyes,as if he wanted to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Graham&#39;s glare was filled with contempt. &#34;You&#39;re a disgrace. Get out of my sight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden&#39;s eyes reddened, his hands balling into fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sting of his father&#39;s disgust cut far deeper than any other wound.Wesley,who had remained silent, stepped forward in a few swift strides, positioning himself protectively in front of Brenden and fixing Davion with a chilling stare.&#34;To me, Brenden is worth more than you will ever be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davion&#39;s smug grin faltered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley continued, &#34;Brenden is diligent and competent. He wasn&#39;t sent to Afluena for any failure.My company started a new project there, and he was chosen to lead the well-digging team.&#34; His icy gaze swept the room. &#34;He&#39;s more capable than any of you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Wesley&#39;s tone was even, his look made everyone feel like they were being seen as trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their faces darkened, but no one dared retort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s authority within the family was unquestioned;even if he insulted them outright, they would stay silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden swelled with pride at Wesley&#39;s public praise.His tears vanished, and he stood taller.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so thankful to Wesley for sending me to Afluena.The ground there is tough as rock,but I still managed to dig a well!&#34; Brenden&#39;s face glowed with newfound confidence as he added, &#34;And going to Afluena helped me grow. There&#39;s even a great girl who&#39;s secretly in  love with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, Alden Moss&#39;s mouth twitched at Brenden&#39;s smugness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could someone as useless as Brenden still have Wesley&#39;s backing? The thought sparked envy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware of the brewing resentment, Brenden continued boasting about Gabriela&#39;s devotion,oblivious to Wesley&#39;s expression darkening like an approaching storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy watched Brenden with a mix of pity and exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This foolish man. If he didn&#39;t stop, Wesley might assign him another grueling project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brenden rambled, he suddenly noticed Wesley had stepped aside, which touched him deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley had not only defended him but also given him the stage to shine. Wesley was truly kind to him, and Brenden silently promised to repay him someday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in his own world of newfound confidence,Brenden didn&#39;t notice their grandfather, Roger Moss,approaching with several younger family members.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing everyone gathered, Roger signaled for the family banquet to start. As they sat around the table, dish after dish arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger, seated at the head of the table, scanned the room before speaking. &#34;Wesley, after the New Year,there&#39;s a shareholders&#39; meeting. Clear your schedule to attend it at the Moss Group headquarters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His invitation was a clear acknowledgment of Wesley&#39;s competence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he about to name Wesley as his successor? Or was the Crownridge Group being handed to hím?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The family members&#39; faces shifted subtly, though they quickly masked their reactions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Davion, often at odds with Wesley, forced a smile and offered congratulations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley responded coolly, &#34;I&#39;ll consider it. My own company keeps me occupied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger, expecting the refusal, didn&#39;t push. &#34;The position will be there for you whenever you decide to return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That announcement cast a subtle tension over the meal,one that even Brenden could feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner,Brenden rushed to the car, inspecting it repeatedly. Billy, curious, asked what he was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a grave expression, Brenden replied, &#34;Grandpa clearly wants Wesley on the board. Didn&#39;t you see?Everyone looked ready to kill him. I need to check if the car has been sabotaged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy realized Brenden had a point and promptly called professional bodyguards over to examine the vehicle</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time they returned to Wesley&#39;s place, it was late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loretta was still away in the countryside, leaving the expansive estate quiet and empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Miriam and Gabriela were in the living room,watching TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The show&#39;s plot wasn&#39;t clear, but Miriam was teary-eyed,muttering,&#34;That poor girl-her husband&#39;s awful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela,uninterested in melodramatic romances,still comforted her patiently. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, he&#39;ll regret it eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their voices broke the stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley paused at the entrance, a faint smile crossing his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Gabriela turned and saw Wesley,she stood  quickly and took his suit jacket as he removed it.&#34;Welcome back,Mr. Moss!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Wesley felt a rare warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the hostility and unpleasantness he had endured at the Mosses&#39; house, coming home to her smile brought him a sense of peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his gaze sharpened. &#34;What happened to your elbow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriela froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been sitting with Miriam for hours, yet Miriam hadn&#39;t noticed, while Wesley picked up on it immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was remarkably observant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing. I tripped on the way back,&#34; she explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley&#39;s eyes darkened, realizing she wasn&#39;t telling him the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without pressing, he rolled up his sleeves and headed to the study, Billy trailing behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden&#39;s heart raced when he saw Gabriela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to her, he had held his head high at the Mosses&#39; house for the first time. Above all, he owed Wesley for giving him the well-digging project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Wesley turned. &#34;Brenden, come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brenden hurried over without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the study, Wesley instructed Billy, &#34;Find out what happened to Gabriela today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away, sir,&#34; Billy replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And...&#34; Wesley paused, then waved him off. &#34;Never mind. You can go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had considered pressuring Marie to return Gabriela&#39;s house sooner, but worried Gabriela would move out immediately if he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted her to stay a bit longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Billy left, Brenden asked eagerly, &#34;What do you need me to do,Wesley?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley frowned. &#34;You should go to bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. I&#39;ll go rest now,&#34; Brenden said, then added,&#34;You&#39;re so good to me, Wesley. I truly appreciate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wesley didn&#39;t bother responding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the study, Brenden hesitated, then approached Gabriela with earnest gratitude.&#34;Thank you,Gabriela.&#34;</p>
