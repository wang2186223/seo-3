                <p>The weight of the silence pressed heavily across the room. In the corner, Snowy curled inside its small house, watching with glassy eyes as its paws scratched nervously at the bedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where the dog sat, Yvonne looked nothing like the calm and gentle person it knew. Her entire body shook as she glared at Julian with the kind of resentment that came from being hurt too many times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian lowered his eyes before crouching down to pick up the bracelet lying on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time Yvonne hurled it away, several diamonds had fallen out. He had sent Morton to repair it and even asked for a few fresh designs to be added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His intention had been simple. He wanted Yvonne to notice these details herself and feel touched by the effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, instead of gratitude, the moment had turned sour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian looked at her trembling figure and said in a quiet voice, &#34;Everything I&#39;ve given you has been yours alone. What made you think otherwise?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne tilted her head back sharply, stopping her tears before they slipped free. Her voice was sharp and full of mockery. &#34;Oh, please. Isn&#39;t this the precious gift you so carefully chose for Rita? You&#39;re good at this. Your little romance could almost bring me to tears.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For Rita?&#34; Julian echoed, his brows furrowing for only a second before the truth behind her fury clicked into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small, weary smile flickered across his lips. He let out a quiet breath, choosing not to defend himself with words right away. Instead, he closed the distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne stiffened instantly. &#34;Stay where you are.&#34; She shuffled backward in a panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she realized she was cornered, Julian was already in front of her. His hand moved deliberately as he caught hers. She twisted against his grip, but his hold remained steady. In the next moment, the bracelet slid back onto her wrist, right where it had been before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This was never meant to be anyone else&#39;s treasure,&#34;Julian said quietly, his gaze meeting hers at last.&#34;Yes, I was reckless with Rita once. I won&#39;t deny it.But whatever that was, it&#39;s long gone. This bracelet has nothing to do with her. It was always meant for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian tightened his hold on Yvonne&#39;s wrist and pressed the small clasp, revealing a string of engraved letters and numbers hidden inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This was never random,&#34; Julian said, his voice low but steady. &#34;Look closer. Those are your initials and your birthday.How could you have missed it all this time?&#34; For a man who guarded his words so carefully, his blunt honesty now felt startling. He wasn&#39;t hinting or dodging-he was laying the truth bare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s breath caught as her eyes dropped to the delicate script. There, etched into the metal, was her name and the date she was born.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something inside her cracked wide open. Pain and resentment surged together, spilling out before she could stop them. &#34;But Rita told me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her own voice faltered. She bit down on her lip,furious at herself. She knew exactly what kind of person Rita was, so why had she let those lies crawl under her skin again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest rose and fell unevenly before she forced the words out, soft and unsteady. &#34;I was wrong.I shouldn&#39;t have doubted you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s lips curled into a faint scoff. &#34;Of course you shouldn&#39;t have. You definitely owe me that apology.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne stared at him, stunned that Julian would use the moment to his advantage. Her chest tightened with a mix of anger and hurt, and yet she had no way to release it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could say a word, Julian reached out and brushed his fingers through her hair. &#34;Don&#39;t let anyone&#39;s gossip shake your faith in me, alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian stood a head taller, so she had to tilt her face toward him. As she met his gaze, a thought began to take shape in her mind, one that refused to quiet down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she had misunderstood everything between them. Maybe Rita had clouded her judgment,and her own sensitivity had twisted things out of proportion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Yvonne wondered if she could finally be honest with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that hope pushing at her heart, she clutched his arm and whispered, her voice trembling, &#34;Julian,what if we end up having a child...&#34;</p>
