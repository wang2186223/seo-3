                <p>Julian&#39;s features hardened as his grip on his phone tightened. After a long moment of silence, he responded in a cold, flat tone, &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the calI ended, Julian stayed rooted in place,eventually rubbing his forehead in exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He should have figured it out sooner-no one but Rita would have the nerve to pull a stunt like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at the moment, there was nothing he could do to stop Rita.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden brush of fur against his leg pulled him from his thoughts. Glancing down, Julian spotted Snowy wagging its tail, tongue hanging out in anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rare laugh slipped out as Julian crouched to give Snowy a scratch behind the ears. The memory of Yvonne insisting he sleep on the sofa flashed through his mind, and with a hint of mock jealousy, he grumbled, &#34;She probably thinks more of you than she does of me now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snowy, unaware of Julian&#39;s words, only nuzzled in closer That night, Yvonne enjoyed the most restful sleep she&#39;d had in years since her marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time morning arrived, Julian had already left.Still, Yvonne barely had a moment to notice his absence, and one look at the clock sent her rushing,realizing she was about to be late for work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sprang out of bed, hurried through her morning routine, and dashed out the door for work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, she made it just in time to clock in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne breathed a sigh of relief, but there was no time to relax. Edwin strode over with a serious look and told her, &#34;Head to the meeting room. The director&#39;s waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just yesterday, Edwin had told her she was no longer needed on that film. Not long after, he&#39;d returned with a different story, this time, offering her the role of the director&#39;s assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting the chance to work on the script was a huge step up from running errands in the studio. Yvonne knew it wouldn&#39;t be easy, but she had no intention of turning down such an opportunity. Yet the moment she walked into the meeting room,she couldn&#39;t help but wrinkle her brow. Heavy smoke hung in the air, the sharp scent making it almost impossible to breathe. Brock sat across from a man in dark sunglasses, who lazily puffed away on his cigarette</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man had a rugged look, a scruffy beard, and an air about him that warned everyone to keep their distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fighting the urge to cough, Yvonne managed a greeting. &#34;Mr. Fuller, I&#39;ve arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock gave Yvonne a brief glance, then faced the man again, his smile almost flattering. &#34;Mr. Duncan, here&#39;s the assistant I mentioned. She&#39;s new, so I hope you&#39;ll help her get settled in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face turning stern, Brock added, &#34;Yvonne, meet Mr.Rocco Duncan. He&#39;s one of the industry&#39;s most respected directors. This is a big break for you, so don&#39;t waste it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco exhaled a swirl of smoke and fixed Yvonne with an icy, appraising glare that made her skin crawl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed, voice dripping with sarcasm, &#34;What&#39;s a young woman like her going to accomplish? She&#39;s just eye candy, isn&#39;t she? Fine, I&#39;ll let her stick around and see if she learns anything, but only because you asked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(vonne&#39;s temper flared, and for a moment, she was ready to snap back. But the memory of that five-million-dollar bet made her grit her teeth and hold her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced herself to stay calm, reasoning that at least being a director&#39;s assistant was better than fetching coffee on set. If the movie succeeded and Julian got his five million, every bit of this would be worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On top of that, Rocco was practically a legend in the industry. No matter how difficult he was, Yvonne knew working under someone with his experience would be a valuable learning opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Yvonne could collect herself, Rocco tossed a project sheet in her direction. &#34;I&#39;ve already picked out the main cast and some key roles. There&#39;s not much left for you to do. Just make sure the leads get fitted for their costumes when they show up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne accepted the papers and glanced over them.But as soon as her eyes landed on the name of the lead actress, her expression changed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s name jumped off the page. She was the star of the film.</p>
