                <p>Yvonne&#39;s strength gave out, and she weakly pushed both men aside. &#34;I&#39;m utterly exhausted. Can&#39;t you just stop fighting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer and Julian exchanged a brief, angry/ glance,and the two quickly looked away, each letting out a scoff as they retreated a step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping his voice cool, Spencer addressed Julian.&#34;What Yvonne needs now is rest. Let&#39;s leave her in peace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a subtle lift of his brow, his tone came out cool and detached. &#34;Then you should go. I&#39;m her husband, and it&#39;s my duty to stay and take care of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer&#39;s expression hardened at the shameless claim, ready to snap back-until Yvonne&#39;s tired voice  cut in first, &#34;You leave too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s face froze for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer let out a faint, mocking chuckle, then turned back to Yvonne with a softened expression.&#34;Rest well, then. I won&#39;t bother you anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her eyes already closing, Yvonne gave the smallest nod.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drifted toward sleep as she listened to footsteps toward the door and the muted click of the door shutting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a faint sigh, convinced both men had gone. When her eyes fluttered open, she froze-Julian was still there, his tall frame casting a shadow by the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you still here?&#34; she asked, startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping his gaze, Julian spoke in a low voice. &#34;Over the past three years, whenever that day arrived1,1was caught up in business trips. I never deliberately avoided going with you to honor your parents.&#34; The silence betwween them grew heavy. Yvonne&#39;s breath slowed, and after a long pause, she turned her face aside with studied indifference. &#34;You don&#39;t need to pay attention to Spencer&#39;s nonsense. I&#39;m not a child. I&#39;m perfectly capable on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian hesitated, words caught in his throat. After a brief silence, he said instead, &#34;I&#39;ll find out the truth about what hapopened on set today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lashes quivered, betraying the calm mask on her face. She glanced back at him, wavered, then asked softly, &#34;And if it turns out to be Rita?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t shake the memory of the afternoon.The only person who had lingered so close was a makeup artist, whose eyes were constantly flitting in her direction, and whose presence was just a little too deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What unsettled her most was that the woman worked exclusively for Rita. Within the entire crew, Rita alone seemed to long for her to be buried and gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Yvonne kept quiet, uncertain how Julian  would react if she spoke up. Deep down, she doubted he would ever truly hold Rita accountable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her suspicion was confirmed the moment he furrowed his brow and cut her off, &#34;Don&#39;t let your imagination run wild. Rita can be spoiled and stubborn, but she&#39;d never play around with someone&#39;s life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words sank into Yvonne like a stone. Her heart plummeted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the stark hospital bed, her pale face twisted into a hollow laugh. What else could she possibly say?Even with undeniable proof, Julian would stand against the whole world to keep Rita safe. To him,Rita was likely some goddess beyond stain or fault,flawless forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How completely naive she had been, believing that a few small, tender gestures meant she had finally surpassed Rita in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The emergency room sank into silence until Julian finally exhaled a weary sigh. &#34;I&#39;ll get to the bottom of this. For now, you need to focus on recovery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s chest tightened with despair. She had no energy left to argue. Turning her back to him, she shut her eyes, her face pale against the pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s mouth thinned, his expression unreadable.Without another word, he turned and strode out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single tear slipped down Yvonne&#39;s cheek, unseen in the dim light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the door, Julian&#39;s face hardened instantly,his eyes as cold as steel. Pulling out his phone, he dialed Morton, his voice clipped and icy. &#34;Dig into Rita&#39;s involvement. I want answers.&#34;</p>
