                <p>Julian paused, his expression unreadable, eyes distant as though weighing something only he knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scandal with Rita had erupted like wildfire,headlines spreading as if someone were deliberately fanning the flames. Even with his power, crushing the story had been far from easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Yvonne seemed oblivious to it. His gaze shifted to the phone lying on his desk. His private line. The only number saved there was hers. Since the rumors broke,the screen had stayed dark-no call, no message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter scoff left his lips. &#34;No explanations needed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morton, watching closely, allowed himself a wry smile.&#34;You&#39;re waiting for Mrs. Powell to reach out first,aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s jaw tensed, the faintest flicker of irritation betraying him. Morton had hit too close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, he wanted Yvonne to confront him. If he explained first, it would look like desperation But the silence from her end gnawed at him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his boss&#39;s mood. Morton added carefully. &#34;It&#39;s her first day at TR Entertainment. She&#39;s probably buried in work,hasn&#39;t even seen the news. Give it time -once she does, she&#39;ll come to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s eyes narrowed, though his tone was clipped.&#34;I don&#39;t need advice from you. What I need is a name.If you don&#39;t uncover who planted that story, forget your bonus this month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morton swallowed hard and slipped out without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the day dragged. Julian moved through meetings and paperwork, but every few minutes his hand drifted to the phone, checking the screen.Evening fell, and still-nothing from Yvonne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip tightened until his knuckles whitened,then,with sudden resolve, he snatched up his car keys and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, his car idled outside her apartment building,his gaze fixed on the lighted windows above.His jaw was set tight, his expression carved from stone,yet the restless tapping of his fingers against the steering wheel betrayed the storm inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, he pushed the door open and stepped into the night air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He told himself it wasn&#39;t concern that drove him here.He only wanted to make sure Yvonne didn&#39;t get shaken by the rumors spreading like wildfire. That was all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that excuse clutched tight, Juian headed into the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the door creaked open, Snowy darted over and wound itself around Julian&#39;s legs.He stooped to scratch behind its ears, his voice barely above a whisper. &#34;Where did your mom wander off to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick flick of its tail, Snowy scuttled deeper into the apartment. Julian followed the puppy&#39;s lead.Under the mellow lamplight, he spotted Yvonne curled up on the sofa, lost in a peaceful sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a certain tiredness in her features, but the gentle rhythm of her breathing made her look calm and content.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wry smile played at Julian&#39;s lips. He had spent the whole day bracing himself, convinced that Yvonne would be upset about what had happened. Yet here she was, unfazed, sleeping as though nothing in the world could trouble her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something shifted inside Julian while he stood there watching her sleep. A rare sense of quiet washed over him, the kind he hadn&#39;t felt in a long while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>元</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could not remember the last time he shared a slice of peace with her. Trying not to wake her, Julian tiptoed over and scooped Yvonne into his arms. As he carried her, the lightness of her frame caught him off guard. She felt even more fragile than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked her into the bedroom and laid her carefully on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne didn&#39;t stir. The world could have been falling apart and she would not have noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian hovered for a moment, letting his fingers drift along her cheek. When she was awake, she always met him with sharp words, but right now, she looked gentle and almost innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All at once, a faint frown creased Yvonne&#39;s brow, and she blinked herself awake, eyes glassy with sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked at him, bewildered, as if unsure whether he was real or simply/a figment of her dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long ago, when their marriage was still intact, Julian would sometimes come home late, and Yvonne always tried to rouse herself, just for the chance to talk to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe tonight, on the verge of losing him, her mind wandered back to those memories</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her waking, Julian slipped on his usual mask of indifference and started to pull away. Before he could, the barely-awake Yvonne reached for him,rubbing her cheek against his palm and murmuring &#34;You&#39;re home. I missed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian stood frozen in place, caught completely off guard.</p>
