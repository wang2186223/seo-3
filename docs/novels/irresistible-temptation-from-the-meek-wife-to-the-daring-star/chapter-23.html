                <p>Yvonne froze in place, trapped in a moment that felt almost suffocating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The HR staff&#39;s voice cut through the silence again, and the room stirred. Several candidates exchanged puzzled looks, whispering under their breath-who would walk away from an interview at TR Entertainment? It seemed utterly absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among them, Yvonne&#39;s urge to retreat stood out the most, drawing every pair of eyes toward her hesitant figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you Yvonne Ellis?&#34; the staff asked pointedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne managed an awkward smile, forced herself to turn around, and gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,come on in. People are waiting,&#34; the staff urged,gesturing toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, the staff slipped back into the interview room, leaving Yvonne little choice but to trail after her, every step heavy with reluctance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She resolved to simply go through the motions.Missing out on the selection wouldn&#39;t trouble her in the slightest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,fate, it seemed, had a cruel sense of humor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Awkward and uneasy, she stepped into the room-only to see Julian seated at the center of the panel,his posture commanding, his presence radiating authority as though he owned the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What on earth was he doing here? A man perpetually buried in work now sitting as an interviewer?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill prickled along her scalp. Instinctively, she turned on her heel to retreat, but his voice cut across the room,halting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get on with the interview.&#34; He delivered the words with quiet detachment, the way one might speak to an outsider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne bit her lip before turning sharply on her heel,forcing her features into calm dignity as she dipped into a graceful bow before the line of interviewers.&#34;Nice to meet you all. I&#39;m Yvonne Ellis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Julian could act detached, treating her as if they were strangers, she resolved to mirror that same composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The panel acknowledged her with polite nods and motioned for her to take a seat. One interviewer scanned her resume, then lifted his gaze. &#34;Ms. Ellis, your record shows you graduated from a prestigious university and even directed several short films that won awards during your studies. Could you explain the three-year gap in your otherwise impressive career?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s hand stilled for an instant at the question,though he said nothing. He picked up her resume,flipping through the pages as if only half-interested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s throat tightened. Her mind drifted unwillingly to the night before graduation-the moment she brushed off every persuasion from teachers and friends to follow her own stubborn choice. That choice had been Julian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, she spoke, her tone carrying a cool steadiness tinged with self-mockery. &#34;I ggot married and spent the last three years as a housewife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The interviewers exchanged startled glances, though Julian only narrowed his eyes, his expression giving nothing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That interviewer pressed on, &#34;Considering you&#39;re married now,what made you decide to return to work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne flicked her gaze toward Julian, catching his detached demeanor, and a wicked impulse rose in her chest. With a playful smile, she replied, &#34;Well, my husband dóesn&#39;t really earn enough to support us, so I thought I&#39;d better help out.&#34; A chill radiated across the table as Julian&#39;s eyes cut toward her, sharp enough to slice through her bravado.The air seemed to freeze under the weight of his glare,and Yvonne&#39;s daring smile crumbled, leaving her tense and flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The questions that followed were routine and professional, and though Julian&#39;s piercing stare lingered like ice, Yvonne managed to respond with poise. After a brief discussion, the panel thanked her politely and asked her to await further notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest tightened. She knew too well that &#34;further notice&#34; usually meant rejection. She had braced herself for disappointment, but the sting still landed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, what weighed heavier was the need to escape Julian&#39;s suffocating presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying nothing more, she rose, bowed gracefully to the panel, and hurried from the room. Her heels clicked quickly across the floor as she made straight for the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief flickered when the doors slid open at her arrival.She reached for them,ready to step inside-only for a strong hand to seize her arm and pull her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whipping around in anger, she froze when her gaze collided with Julian&#39;s, her fury draining away beneath the force of his eyes.</p>
