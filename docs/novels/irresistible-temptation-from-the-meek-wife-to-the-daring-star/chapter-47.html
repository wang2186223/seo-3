                <p>Yvonne sat hunched on the pool&#39;s edge, water streaming from her hair andclothes as she shivered,her complexion ghostly pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian shrugged off his suit jacket and wrapped it around her shoulders, then pulled her into his arms,pressing her against his chest to share his warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around them, the crew members exchanged uneasy glances, their faces clouded with tangled emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the back, Rita stood rigid, her fists clenched so tightly her knuckles whitened, her face etched with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In front of everyone, Julian&#39;s protective tenderness toward Yvonne could not be ignored. Between the two of them lingered a closeness, a silent intimacy that instinctively shut out the rest of the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes turned toward Rita, heavy with suspicion. How the hell could a wife endure watching her husband lavish such care on another woman in plain sight?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita, naturally, could hardly stomach the sight,yet she had no legitimate excuse to raise a protest-after all, she wasn&#39;t Julian&#39;s wife, as everyone boelieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat crept up her cheeks, a flush of humiliation mixed with simmering rage, and for a moment she toyed with the idea of stepping forward to spin some misleading tale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Julian didn&#39;t even spare her a glance. Instead, he gathered Yvonne into his arms and, with his voice sharpened by urgency, told Morton at his side,&#34;Hospital.Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morton snapped to attention and hurried to lead the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Julian strode off carrying Yvonne, Rita&#39;s jaw clenched until her teeth ached. Hatred churned in her chest. If Yvonne had &#34;accidentally&#34; drowned today, it would have solved everything neatly. Yet Julian&#39;s sudden appearance had shattered that possibility, throwing all her carefully laid hopes into chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock, who had been quietly observing, drifted closer with narrowed eyes. Something in Julian&#39;s behavior had stirred his suspicions. &#34;Ms. Adams,&#34; he asked, his tone laced with curiosity. &#34;What exactly is Yvonne&#39;s connection to Mr. Powell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock had always been sharp. With Julian&#39;s stature, it seemed unlikely he&#39;d risk such public concern for nothing more than a casual mistress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s pulse faltered. If the crew discovered that Yvonne was Julian&#39;s lawful wife, the social climbers among them would instantly switch allegiance, and her days here would be a hell. That was a truth she sure as hell couldn&#39;t allow to surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita forced her breath to steady, masking her nerves beneath a veneer of scorn. Instead of giving Brock a straight answer, she let out a dismissive laugh and drawled, &#34;Why don&#39;t you take a guess-what do you think they are to each other?&#34; Brock faltered, his tongue hesitating with a mix of caution and curiosity, his eyes flickering as he weighed the consequences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already offended Yvonne once; if he made the wrong call again, he risked offending Rita as well.No matter which side proved true, he would end up cornered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was precisely what Rita wanted. She left him dangling in uncertainty, punctuating her silence with a derisive snort before sweeping off with exaggerated arrogance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the crew&#39;s dressing room, the atmosphere shifted. Janet Finch, Rita&#39;s personal makeup artist,nervously bolted the door before rushing back toward her. Her hands trembled as she wrung them,her voice cracking with dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rita,&#34; Janet whispered urgently. &#34;When you told me to push Yvonne into the pool, you never said the plan was to end her life! Now Mr. Powell&#39;s aware of what happened, and if he digs deeper and traces this back to me, I&#39;m utterly ruined!&#34; A flicker of contempt passed through Rita&#39;s eyes as she clenched her teeth. &#34;I never imagined Julian would actually show up today...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got to help me,&#34; Janet begged, her face streaked with tears. &#34;I only did what you asked. This isn&#39;t on me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s stomach tightened with annoyance. If Janet had chosen her moment with more care, Yvonne would already be gone for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she couldn&#39;t afford to antagonize her. If Janet panicked and ran to Julian with the truth, everything Rita had built would crumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After weighing her options, Rita forced a sweet smile and pressed a bank card into Janet&#39;s trembling hands, feigning concern. &#34;There&#39;s two hundred thousand on this. Take it and get out of Kumvine right now. Don&#39;t come back until | tell you it&#39;s safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janet clutched the card blankly, her head bobbing in a dazed nod.</p>
