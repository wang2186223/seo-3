            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>The mob pressed forward, faces twisted with malice, their voices rising in unison like a rehearsed chant demanding Yvonne&#39;s exile from the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She backed away instinctively until her shoulders bumped against a corner piled high with abandoned props and clutter-no room left to retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not a home-wrecker...&#34; Her protest barely escaped her lips before the roar of jeers smothered it, her words swallowed whole by the frenzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the edge of the crowd, Rita lingered like a queen surveying her stage. Arms folded across her chest, she wore a triumphant smirk, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing off to the side, Rita drank in every detail-Yvonne&#39;s face ashen, a thin line of blood sliding from the cut at her brow, her figure pressed against the wall like prey cornered by predators.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight was pitiful, almost humiliating, and it thrilled Rita beyond measure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, she had fretted over how to gloat-how to remind Yvonne that not only had she evaded consequence but had strutted right back into the spotlight, resuming her work without pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fate had spared her the trouble. Yvonne, battered and defenseless, had stumbled straight into her humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Rita had reappeared on set, whispers of doubt shadowed her presence. Yet once Julian&#39;s bodyguards stationed themselves around her like an impenetrable wall, the crew no longer questioned her position.In their eyes, she had secured the role of his legitimate wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This round belonged to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After basking in the spectacle long enough, she finally stepped forward, slipping into the guise of a merciful savior. With false tenderness, she said, &#34;Don&#39;t hold it against Yvonne. I&#39;ve already let it go...&#34; &#34;You&#39;re too generous, Rita! That rotten slut ought to be condemned to hell!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right! Shame on that damn homewrecker!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the insults piled up, no one noticed the flicker of unease on Rita&#39;s face when the word&#34;homewrecker&#34;was spat with such malice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came Yvonne&#39;s laugh-low, jagged, and mocking-slicing through the air like broken glass. She fixed her gaze on Rita, her blood-streaked face ghastly beneath the trickle that blurred her vision, making her look terrifyingly unbroken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne swayed on her feet but still advanced, closing the distance between herself and Rita with two unsteady steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The real shame is the woman who knowingly steals someone else&#39;s place. Rita, why don&#39;t you enlighten everyone here-who&#39;s the true homewrecker?&#34; she spat, her lips curling into a bitter sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow of fear flickered across Rita&#39;s expression before she instinctively recoiled, her heel scraping against the floor as she stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Yvonne could press her point, a hard shove sent her stumbling backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?!&#34; a voice shouted, thick with accusation. &#34;Trying to attack Rita now?Everyone knows you&#39;re the mistress! Don&#39;t fool yourself-screwing around with Mr. Powell won&#39;t raise your damn status. He only gives a damn about Rita!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The speaker jabbed a finger toward the suited men looming behind Rita. &#34;Look at them! Those bodyguards were assigned by Mr. Powell himself to protect her-because of people like you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As heads around her nodded in agreement, Rita regained her composure, slipping back into a soft, pitiable demeanor. &#34;Yvonne, I know it&#39;s hard for you to accept, but Jules doesn&#39;t belong to you. Please stop clinging to him,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her shameless performance made Yvonne&#39;s chest burn with anger, yet beneath it throbbed a raw ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguards standing behind Rita were unmistakably from the Powell family. Considering the hell Rita had dragged her into, it made no sense that Julían gave Rita bodyguards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The irony twisted so sharply that Yvonne actually laughed out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every sneer from the crowd suddenly rang true--Julian only cared about Rita. The fleeting happiness she had tasted these past few days hnad been nothing more than Julian&#39;s carefully spun illusion. And she had been foolish enough to believe it, to imagine-just for a moment-that he might have cared for her, even a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reality had slammed her back into clarity with merciless intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Julian&#39;s world, she was nothing more than a gullible fool, easy to placate and easier to deceive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne shut her eyes, the sting of blood seeping into them at last making itself felt. She forced her tears back,steadying her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never wanted to steal from anyone,&#34; she said, voice trembling with restraint.&#34;A∥I want is to take back what belongs to me and walk away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all she had asked for from the start-her own things returned. Yet they clung to her, dragging open old scars, forcing her humiliation again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, a bag hit the floor at her feet, the impact scattering its contents. A laptop skidded out,its screen shattered into a spiderweb of glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum&#39;s smug voice rang out, sharp and mocking. &#34;Take it and get the hell out of here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s vision flared red with fury. She shot him a glare that cut like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very next second, a fist slammed across Callum&#39;s face with brutal force.</p>
