                <p>Spencer eased the car out of the parking space,trading lighthearted chatter with Yvonne. But their laughter cut short when a sleek black luxury car shot toward them out of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Spencer slammed on the brakes. The tires screeched, the car whipping in a half-spin before jerking to a halt-barely two feet from disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heart pounding, Spencer twisted toward Yvonne at once. &#34;Yvonne,are you hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clutched the seatbelt as if it were a lifeline, her knuckles white, her face drained of color. She only managed a small shake of her head, eyes wide with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury tightening his jaw, Spencer tore at his seatbelt buckle, ready to storm out and confront the reckless driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the black car&#39;s headlights blinked in a deliberate rhythm-taunting, like a predator flashing its fangs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne lifted a trembling hand to shield her eyes from the glare, peering through her fingers until the license plate came into focus. Her stomach lurched-Julian&#39;s car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost immediately, her phone buzzed in her palm.The number flashing on the screen was unfamiliar,yet she knew without doubt it was Julian calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face darkened as she hesitated, then reluctantly swiped to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s voice cut through the line, cold and commanding, brooking no argument.&#34;Get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath caught in her throat, defiance rising to her lips, but before she could speak, the call clicked off,leaving only the dead tone ringing in her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost instantly, the car facing them blasted its horn,a sharp command for her to act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s teeth sank into her lip before she finally pushed the door open. Her hand barely touched the handle when Spencer caught it, his grip firm,his head shaking in protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes burned as he stared at her. &#34;Yvonne, don&#39;t do this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t blind; the situation was clear enough. His glare cut toward Julian&#39;s car, simmering with hostility &#34;No one has the right to force you into anything You&#39;re already divorcing him-there&#39;s no reason to let yourself be trapped again,&#34; Spencer said, his voice steady and resolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From inside the luxury car, Julian narrowed his eyes,locking onto Spencer in a cold, wordless standoff.He then set his eyes on their clasped hands, and a shadow passed over his face, his jaw tightening with unspoken fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The razor-sharp intensity of his stare made Yvonne&#39;s spine prickle. She snatched her hand away from Spencer&#39;s, her pulse quickening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Julian&#39;s temperament better than anyone -his possessiveness was a cage lined with knives. If she dared stay inside Spencer&#39;s car,he would surely drag Spencer into his storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about me,&#34; Yvonne murmured, forcing a fragile smile that didn&#39;t reach her eyes. She unlatched the door and stepped out, her movements heavy with reluctance as she walked toward Julian&#39;s car,waiting like a predator in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Julian reclined against the leather seat with ease, one hand drumming an idle rhythm on the steering wheel. His eyes tracked her approach,and the faint curve of satisfaction at his lips hinted at a victory only he recognized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a monarch who believed the world bent to his will,he radiated certainty that she wouldn&#39;t dare defy him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne drew in a steadying breath, hating the domineering air that clung to Julian. To her,his sudden appearance had nothing to do with care or concern-only the flare of his suffocating possessiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had dared to break free, to file for divorce, and he clearly saw that act as nothing less than a direct challenge to his authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression remained frosty as she settled into the passenger seat, buckling her seatbelt in silence,not sparing himn a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s gaze lingered on her cold detachment,and the memory of that divorce agreement ignited a fresh wave of fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips curled into a mocking sneer. &#34;So,you&#39;re really leaving me for him, is that it? You really do have terrible taste in men.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s lips curved in a faint sneer. He knew exactly who Spencer was-the heir of Briggs Pharmaceutical Corporation. The Briggs family was wealthy, but in his eyes,still leagues below the Powell family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s brows knit together. She parted her lips,  wanting to clarify that she and Spencer were nothing more than friends. But before she could utter a word,Julian&#39;s volatile temper snapped. The engine roared as he slammed his foot down on the accelerator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden lurch sent the car surging forward,wrenching a startled gasp from Yvonne. Her hand shot to the grab handle for balance, panic flashing in her eyes. &#34;What on earth are you doing? Slow down!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s face stayed cold, unreadable, as his foot pressed mercilessly on the gas.</p>
