                <p>Julian shifted slightly to the side, letting Rita stumble forward and land right into Morton&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morton caught her in an awkward embrace and asked, &#34;Ms. Adams, are you hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rushed to her cheeks-embarrassment mixed with irritation-as she bit down on her lip and turned toward Julian,who was crouched beside the unconscious intruder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, she brushed Morton away and drifted toward Julian, her posture trembling, eyes brimming with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I came back today to pack, I felt someone lurking inside,&#34; she whispered, her voice fragile.&#34;Trne moment I stepped in, he lunged at me. Luckily, I had pepper spray on hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lip trembled as she spoke, her gaze fixed pitifully on Julian as if pleading for comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian appeared blind to Rita&#39;s performance, his attention fixed on the unconscious man sprawled across the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding her teeth, Rita forced herself to keep playing the victim. &#34;It wasn&#39;t untiI afterward that I learned he was carrying a Hawthorne family token...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Julian pulled a badge from the man&#39;s pocket. An iris-shaped crest glinted under the light-the unmistakable mark of the Hawthorne family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His features stiffened, a shadow crossing his face in an instant. Without doubt, it was the emblem of the Hawthorne family. He recognized it instantly, recalling the same badge Liam had owned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of the discovery, Rita let her tears spill faster, her voice shaking with dread. &#34;They&#39;ve tracked me down, Julian! You know what kind of man Grayson is-he&#39;ll never let me walk away alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance flared in Julian&#39;s eyes. Rising to his feet, he stated in a glacial tone,	&#34;One man doesn&#39;t mean much. If they&#39;d uncovered the truth, they wouldn&#39;t have sent him alone. Stop working yourself up.&#34; Rita shook her head in desperation and flung herself at Julian, clinging to his waist. This time he wasn&#39;t quick enough to sidestep. His brows drew tight as he tried to pry her hands off, but she only gripped him more fiercely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julian, I&#39;m only safe if I stay by your side. You can&#39;t send me to Briysil. They&#39;ll ambush me on the way and kill me-and the baby!&#34; she begged, her voice breaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He studied her with a deep frown, the possibility already gnawing at him. Still, he had given Yvonne his word that he would deal with Rita, and he had no intention of breaking that promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a steady hand, he pried her arms loose, his tone calm yet unyielding. &#34;Grayson won&#39;t uncover the truth.I have spread fake information about your pregnancy. Even if he learns about it, he&#39;ll assume it happened after Liam&#39;s death. He won&#39;t imagine the child belongs to Liam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita jutted out her lip in wounded defiance, poised to argue again, but Julian rubbed his temples with weary impatience and cut her off. &#34;If Briysil terrifies you that much, then find another place to stay. I&#39;ll assign bodyguards to keep you safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s eyes brightened with a sudden glint of hope. She held to the belief that being by Julian&#39;s side stil gave her a shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pretending to hesitate, she pressed the matter further. &#34;But what about the film I&#39;ve been working on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian let out a.dry laugh. &#34;Do you really want to make yourself easier to find by parading under the spotlight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest tightened with panic. If the project collapsed, she&#39;d be forced into obscurity, and all her careful maneuvering would collapse with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up as she stammered, her voice breaking, &#34;But this is everything l&#39;ve worked for. Liam promised I&#39;d become an international star... Julian, I swear I&#39;ll be careful. And aren&#39;t your men here to keep me safe anyway?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s patience thinned as Rita dragged Liam&#39;s name into the conversation once more. Affection had limits, and while he had no intention of abandoning her safety, the endless clinging wore him down. His mind wandered briefly to Yvonne, left alone at home-was she overthinking in his absence?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cut the discussion short. In his eyes, he had fulfilled his duty to Liam. With a voice as cold as steel, he declared, &#34;Do whatever you want. If filming matters that much, then keep at it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s face brightened instantly, delight spilling across her features. She reached for his arm, her voice sugary with adoration. &#34;Julian, you&#39;re always so kind to me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he swiveled away without hesitation, sidestepping her grasp. His gaze landed on Morton, and his order came clipped and cool. &#34;Take care of this mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morton gave a sharp nod as Julian strode toward the door and vanished without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left behind, Rita sank her teeth into her lip, frustration simmering beneath the smile she forced onto her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to crumble. After all, she had managed to stay in Kumvine-her foothold was secure, and she wasn&#39;t about to let it slip.</p>
