                <p>Yvonne&#39;s pulse quickened, and she struggled to steady her breath as her anxious eyes met Julian&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never before had they shared a bed while both were completely sober.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about Julian&#39;s behavior tonight put her on edge,filling her with unease. She shifted beneath him,attempting to wriggle free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could get far, Julian&#39;s hand wrapped around hers, bringing her movements to a halt. There was something dark and unreadable in his stare,something that set her nerves on fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in, he let his breath brush past her ear, and Yvonne couldn&#39;t help but shiver. She clamped her eyes shut, caught between anxiety and a thrill she couldn&#39;t quite name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of what she expected, his voice came out flat and dismissive. &#34;Go to sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, the weight on her body disappeared as Julian rolled over and settled beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Yvonne stared up at the ceiling, her thoughts a tangled mess. Was she supposed to feel let down or grateful? She couldn&#39;t decide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stealing a look at the man next to her, she saw him lying perfectly still, eyes closed. Frustrated, she turned away from Julian, biting her lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desire simmered inside her, but Yvonne forced herself to steady her breathing and shut her eyes, determined to fall asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Julian&#39;s arm reached out, wrapping around her waist and pulling her into his wvarmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s heartbeat hammered against her back, barely muted by his thin T-shirt,leaving Yvonne&#39;s thoughts in a whirl. She fought to steady herself and tried to pull his hand away, but his grip stayed firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His touch only grew bolder as his hand slipped under her shirt, his callused fingers gliding along her stomach in a way that made her shiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a rush of disbelief, Yvonne snatched Julian&#39;s hand, giving him a pointed glare. &#34;What exactly are you trying to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian arched a brow, his tone light but teasing.&#34;You&#39;ve lost weight, but your waist feels a little fuller to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A momentary panic darted across Yvonne&#39;s face, and  she turned away fast enough to hide it from Julian.Trying to keep her voice steady, she said, &#34;I just ate too much tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian didn&#39;t push the topic, and he fell silent, though his hand lingered against her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne couldn&#39;t figure out if he actually bought her explanation, but she didn&#39;t dare move his hand away.Gradually,she forced herself to get used to his touch.After a while, she realized his palm radiated a warmth that brought her a surprising sense of calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For reasons she couldn&#39;t explain, Yvonne&#39;s mind drifted back to something she&#39;d seen during her hospital check-ups, where husbands gently cradled their wives&#39; bellies, just like Julian was doing now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered thne doctor mentioning that it was the father&#39;s way of greeting the baby, who could sense it. Maybe their child could feel Julian&#39;s touch,too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought comforted her, and for the first time in a while, Yvonne driftedoff peacefully,with no nausea or restlessness, snuggled up beside Julian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he heard Yvonne&#39;s breathing deepen, Julian lowered his head to brush a stray lock of hair from her face, feeling strangely at peace himself. He slowly slipped his arm out from under her and was about to  settle in for the night when his phone buzzed on the nightstand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian glanced at the screen and saw Morton was calling. Given the hour, Julian knew Morton wouldn&#39;t interrupt him without a good reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow crossed Julian&#39;s eyes as he gently wrapped the blanket around Yvonne, slipped quietly out of bed,and headed into the living room to answer Morton&#39;s call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; he asked quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morton&#39;s voice came through the line. &#34;Mr. Powell,we&#39;ve contained the story. But it turns out someone paid off a reporter to track you, take photos, and leak the details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s gaze turned icy as he demanded, &#34;Who was it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause before Morton finally admitted, &#34;It was Ms. Adams.&#34;</p>
