                <p>Janet somehow tore free fromthe bindings in a sudden burst of desperation, ripping the tape from her lips as she stumbled forward. She collapsed at Rita&#39;s feet, her face streaked with tears. &#34;Rita, please -save me! I was about to get on the plane, but they caught me... I couldn&#39;t get away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita didn&#39;t move. She stood stiff and pale, as though her soul had slipped from her body. Her thoughts spun wildly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had Julian found Janet sofast?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Rita gave no answer, Janet&#39;s sobs grew shriller. She clutched at Rita&#39;s legs, her voice breaking. &#34;Rita, it was you who told me to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Silence!&#34; Rita exclaimed, her eyes flashing. &#34;What nonsense are you spouting? I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about!&#34; Her chest rose and fell violently. In a sudden burst,she seized Janet by the collar, forcing her upright with trembling hands. &#34;This was your doing,and yours alone. You couldn&#39;t stomach her better family background, so you shoved her into the pool. Do you understand me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janet froze, staring up in confusion, betrayal written across her tear-soaked face. She had only been blinded by her hunger for more, never realizing that in the ruthless circles of the elite, pawns like her were destined to be discarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the sound-measured, deliberate footsteps cutting through the room like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s head whipped around, her entire body trembling. Her eyes landed first on the gleam of polished leather shoes. Her aura weakened. She bowed her head instantly, unable to summon the courage to lift her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The steps stopped just before her. A voice, cold as steel,fell from above. &#34;Explain yourself.&#34; Rita&#39;s stomach dropped. Panic clawed up her throat.This was different-Julian&#39;s fury was real this time,and no feigned fainting spell could shield her from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita barely managed to part her lips before Julian&#39;s voice crashed down again, low and unyielding. &#34;Don&#39;t even think of lying to me. You know better than anyone how | deal with liars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian was not a man who moved without certainty. If he had called her here tonight, it meant every truth was already laid bare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s defenses crumbled, and tears streaked her cheeks. &#34;Julian... please, just hear me out. I didn&#39;t mean for any of it to happen. It was Yvonne-she kept parading your marriage in front of me, and |just... I couldn&#39;t take it anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy sigh escaped Julian as he pinched the bridge of his nose, frustration burning through him.He had indulged her too much, allowed her too many chances, and she had crossed his boundaries repeatedly. His eyes cut back to her. &#34;And what about the scandal you stirred last time? You asked me to bring you back and protect you, yet you summoned the media yourself, as though you wanted them to hunt you down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sobs grew louder, but no explanation followed-only the sound of desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s jaw tightened. A single glance at Morton was enough; he stepped forward and quietly led Janet out, leaving Julian and Rita alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the door closed, Rita seized on the chance, mistaking his silence for mercy. Her eyes lifted, shimmering with false hope. &#34;Julian, I knew you&#39;d never abandon me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her relief lasted only a heartbeat. Julian extended a plane ticket toward her. &#34;A ticket to Briysil. You leave tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from her face. She staggered back, her head shaking violently. &#34;No-you can&#39;t send me there. If they find me, I&#39;ll be dead!&#34; Julian&#39;s tone carried the weight of finality. &#34;The Powell family holds power in Briysil. No one will touch you. Even if they find you, they&#39;ll think twice before making a move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The firmness in his voice made her stomach sink.Panic clawed at her as she shook her head harder,retreating step by step. &#34;No, I won&#39;t go. The only place I&#39;m safe is beside you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes went wild, hysteria breaking through.&#34;You swore to Liam you&#39;d protect me-and the child! Have you forgotten? He gave his life for yours!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian froze, his heart stuttering at the sound of Liam&#39;s name.</p>
