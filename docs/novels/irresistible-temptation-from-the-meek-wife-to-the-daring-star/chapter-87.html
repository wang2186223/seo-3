                <p>Soft light spilled from the study lamp as Julian hunched behind his desk, eyes fixed on a contract glowing across his laptop screen, fingers tapping out quick,scattered notes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already finished washing the dishes, and instead of returning to the bedroom he shared with Yvonne, he lingered in the study. He knew she was upset, and if he went back now, their words would surely turn into another fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than face her, he buried himself in work,waiting for the comfort of silence once she drifted off to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, the phone beside him lit up, the screen flashing with a new notification.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up the phone without much thought,scanning the screen. A frown slowly appeared on his face,confusion written all over his eyes. The alert showed a bank transaction. Five dollars had been spent through his supplementary card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With so many zeroes in his accounts, a single-digit withdrawal leapt out at him, almost absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His life as CEO of Powell Group meant most charges were hefty, usually five figures at least. Why would there be a purchase for just five dollars? What could possibly cost so little? Yvonne&#39;s doing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The possibility pressed against his thoughts, and his frown deepened as he grew curious about what Yvonne had bought for that small amount.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at the notification a moment longer before switching to the call screen and dialing Morton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look into something for me right now,&#34; said Julian.(</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In another room, Yvonne glanced at the confirmation message on her shopping app and let out a quiet breath of relief, knowing that the supplementary card still worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The purchase had been little more than a trial run, so Yvonne picked the first thing she saw-turns out she&#39;d just bought a ridiculous pack of neon plastic bracelets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne barely gave them a thought. Once she confirmed the supplementary card worked, her mind immediately shifted to how she could turn that access into real money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Transferring the funds directly into her own account was impossible. Julian would see it instantly,and the card would be blocked before the transfer cleared.She needed a quieter way, something clever enough to slip under his notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An idea sparked, and her lips curved faintly. If she wanted real money, all she had to do was buy high-value goods and flip them for cash. Luxury items lost a bit of value when resold, but that hardly mattered-what she needed was liquidity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decision made, she wasted no time. Tapping through page after page of designer flagship stores, Yvonne started snapping up items with abandon. Meanwhile, Julian&#39;s phone vibrated nonstop, one transaction after another flashing across the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He narrowed his eyes, watching the string of notifications mount. Just beneath them, Morton&#39;s message waited unread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Yvonne finally set her phone aside, a quiet satisfaction settled over her. Even with the expected dip in resale value, the haul should still net her over ten million-just enough to fund her ambitions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The best part was that Julian would never suspect her. He had never cared about her spending habits,sometimes even sending luxury items home for her amusement. To him, it wvas just another way to keep her distracted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never been drawn to extravagance, but tonight, her view had shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the financial knot loosened, her shoulders eased. She pulled out the film proposal and bent over the script with renewed focus. Snowy, sensing her good mood, shook out its thick fur and hopped into her lap, tail thumping as it nudged her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She absentmindedly stroked its silky coat, and the little dog flipped onto its back, begging for belly rubs with eyes half-closed in contentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, both Yvonne and Snowy were sprawled comfortably across the bed, each claiming half the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the clock hands touched eleven,Julian assumed she had drifted off.Quietly, he opened the bedroom door, only to pause at the sight before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze darkened. Snowy lay sprawled across the exact spot where he usually slept.</p>
