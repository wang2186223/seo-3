                <p>In the lush garden, Rodger reclined in a rocking chair, swaying gently as he immersed himself in a book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fluffy white puppy, tongue hanging, frolicked around him in playful circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian had informed Rodger ahead of time that he and Yvonne would be visiting the Powell estate today, and he had already brought Snowy along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger sipped his coffee, then leaned down to scoop the pup onto his lap, and said with a warm grin,&#34;You&#39;re an absolute delight, little one. I can&#39;t wait for the day Yvonne and Julian give me a great-grandchild to cuddle!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rodger...&#34; Yvonne&#39;s voice carried a hint of fond exasperation as she stepped into the garden, arm linked with Julian&#39;s. Her eyes widened briefly at the sight of Snowy, her grip on Julian tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hit her instantly-Julian had made all the arrangements, even bringing Snowy, without consulting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she swallowed her irritation, keeping up the facade of a devoted couple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian felt the sudden pressure on his arm and glanced at her, his throat bobbing as he opened his mouth to speak, but Yvonne had already released him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling, she approached Rodger and began massaging his shoulders gently. &#34;How are you feeling today,Rodger?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better than ever. Seeing you two works wonders on me,&#34;Rodger replied, humming contentedly as he closed his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s gaze drifted to the book in his hands, and she shook her head slightly, almost imperceptibly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The title read, &#34;Strategies to Strengthen Marital Relationships.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at the table, she spotted more books with titles like &#34;Enhancing Connection for Young Couples&#34;and &#34;Fostering Intimacy in Modern Relationships&#34;. Her cheeks flushed as she quickly averted her eyes, hesitating before asking, &#34;Why are you reading these books?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s attention shifted to the stack, his eyes narrowing. A faint crack appeared in his usual calm, and he nearly reached up to pinch the bridge of his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With surprising agility for his age, Rodger snatched a newspaper and draped it over the books. Smiling brightly, he sidestepped the question. &#34;How long are you two staying? Is there anything you need? I can have it arranged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s brow furrowed as he noticed the unusual quiet of the estate. &#34;Grandpa, where is Dario? And the rest of the staff? Why is no one around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dario Mason, the ever-present butler of the Powell estate, was nowhere to be seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger arched an eyebrow, sipping his coffee with deliberate calm. &#34;I gave them all a week&#39;s leave. They&#39;ve been working hard,you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian and Yvonne froze, their faces mirroring disbelief. &#34;Then who is handling the cooking and cleaning?&#34;Julian asked, incredulous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s tone was light, almost playful. &#34;That would be you, my boy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me?&#34; Julian, rarely rattled, pointed at himself, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve read up on the latest trends. Stay-at-home husbands are all the rage. I&#39;m going to shape you into a stellar husband, son, and grandson over the next seven days!&#34; Rodger said with a gleam in his eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian pinched the bridge of his nose, exasperated, and turned to leave.andpa,I&#39;ve got the company to run.I can&#39;t stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t just abandon the Powell Group&#39;s business, which was worth tens of billions, to play as a stay-at-home husband. To him, that would be utterly crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could take a step, Rodger&#39;s measured words stopped him.&#34;I&#39;ve already-cleared it with the board. You&#39;re working from home this week.&#34; Julian spun back, a sigh escaping as he prepared to argue the sheer lunacy of it. Just then, a pink apron flew toward him.He-caught it reflexively, his lips twitching as he registered what it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s grin was mischievous. &#34;I&#39;m hungry. How about you get started on dinner? Yvonne and I are eager to taste your handiwork.&#34;</p>
