                <p>As she spoke, Yvonne locked her gaze on Julian&#39;s eyes, searching for even the slightest hint of unease or any telltale emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Julian&#39;s composure didn&#39;t waver. His face betrayed no guilt as he responded with calm sincerity, &#34;I&#39;m a businessman. Investments carry risks. Two hundred thousand is my most generous offer for this film.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you saying I&#39;m bound to lose money?&#34; Yvonne shot back, her jaw clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s expression remained infuriatingly innocent his voice steady. &#34;I didn&#39;t say that. But if you&#39;re intimidated, you could always back out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne took a sharp breath, fighting the impulse to fling the cake at him. Her words came out deliberate and firm. &#34;I. Will. Never. Give. Up.&#34; Julian&#39;s eyes dropped briefly, a subtle smirk tugging at his lips. &#34;I respect your determination. I&#39;m eager to see your film come to life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Yvonne, his words felt like a taunt. Her anger surged, but she was powerless to lash out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a tense pause, she tossed the half-eaten cake onto the table in frustration and stood, her face icy.&#34;I&#39;m done for the day. I&#39;m heading home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she stormed out, leaving her bag behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian, unhurried, picked up the bag and trailed after her with a relaxed stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne rushed to the elevator, jabbing the button repeatedly. When the doors slid open, she darted inside and hammered the close button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the doors began to shut, Julian slipped in with effortless grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still fuming, Yvonne turned her face away, refusing to acknowledge him. Yet Julian&#39;s presence filled the space. The crisp,woody scent of his cologne saturated the air, a constant reminder of how close he stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the elevator began its descent, Yvonne&#39;s irritation grew. Thirty floors had never felt so endless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The building hosted multiple companies, and during peak hours, most elevators were crowded. Yet here they were, alone in this one, the silence amplifying the sound of their breathing and the faint thump of their heartbeats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Yvonne&#39;s restlessness peaked, Julian reached toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, she flinched back, forgetting the elevator wall behind her. Pressing against it, she eyed him cautiously. &#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian stepped closer, closing the small distance between them, his gaze lowering to meet hers.Yvonne&#39;s pulse quickened, and she turned her head aside. If Julian tried to kiss her now, she wasn&#39;t sure she would push him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts scattered as Julian&#39;s fingertip grazed the corner of her mouth, gently brushing something away. She swallowed hard, nerves tingling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the sensation could fully take hold, Julian stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne stared, dazed, a flicker of confusion in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she watched as Julian pulled a neatly folded handkerchief from his suit pocket, his eyes dropping as he carefully wiped his finger. Only then did he look up and say, &#34;You had some cake on the corner of your mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s frustration surged, nearly choking her. How had she fallen for someone like Julian?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator reached the ground floor just in time,sparing her further turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the doors opened, she strode out, silently vowing that she would firmly resist his charm next time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in the next instant, she faltered, her resolve crumbling under the weight of his striking looks-the very thing that had drawn her to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming, Yvonne quickened her steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind her, Julian followed with an amused, almost fond smile, shaking his head as he easily kept pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to them, several onlookers in the distance quietly observed the exchange.</p>
