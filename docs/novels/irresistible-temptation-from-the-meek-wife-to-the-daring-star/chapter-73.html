                <p>Down in the garage, Yvonne glanced at her phone, uncertainty swirling inside her. Julian had promised to drive her, yet he still hadn&#39;t shown up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She debated sending a message to let him know she could manage alone, but before she could decide,Julian emerged. Sharp in a tailored suit, he carried a lunch box that looked out of place in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without meeting her eyes, Julian handed her the box. &#34;Lunch. After work, wait for me. I&#39;ll come pick you up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Yvonne just blinked, caught off guard by the gentle command. She tried to lighten the mood,teasing, &#34;You&#39;re really getting into this husband role, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, the act was for Rodger&#39;s benefit, but his thoughtfulness seemed a little too real. It was almost as if Julian had forgotten where the performance ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, Julian simply pressed the car key, the doors unlocking with a brisk&#34;beep.&#34; HHe pulled the door open for her and kept his words simple. &#34;Hop in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her eyes, Yvonne hesitated. Her gaze drifted to Julian&#39;s hand resting on the door, something about the gesture making her pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian watched her, a puzzled look flickering across his face when she didn&#39;t move. She pressed her lips together and murmured, &#34;Give me a second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she darted away, returning a moment later, a little breathless as she slid into the passenger seat. &#34;Alright,we can go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian shot her à quick look but didn&#39;t ask about her brief detour. He turned the key, started the engine, and the car glided forward in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For most of the ride, Yvonne stared at her lap, lost in a maze of thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth he showed unsettled her, tangled further by the anonymous photo from the night before-proof he had gone to see Rita.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dozen questions hovered on her tongue. Should she just come out and ask where he&#39;d been? Did she even have the right to ask?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mood sank under the weight of it, and heaviness pressed down on her chest. She barely noticed when the car coasted to a stop at a red light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian finally broke the silence, his voice steady. &#34;I&#39;ll have Morton send you the film proposal this afternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s words reminded Yvonne of the promise he&#39;d made about a new project-something she&#39;d almost dismissed as empty talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The seriousness in his tone caught her off guard. After a pause, she whispered, &#34;Thanks for remembering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inwardly, she found the whole thing strangely ironic. He hadn&#39;t confronted the real source of the trouble,yet he could spend his evenings with Rita and still toss her a small token as if it would make up for everything.Was she really supposed to be grateful for that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another thought cut through her-maybe Julian&#39;s eagerness to hand her a project was nothing more than a way to speed up her earnings, so the five million would be repaid quickly and the divorce could come sooner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With doubts swirling, Yvonne&#39;s mid drifted toward the bleakest scenario. Her heart tightened, and a quiet,slightly bitter laugh slipped out before she could stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian glanced her way, a frown drawing his brows together. Quickly, Yvonne turned away and rolled the window down, letting the morning breeze dry her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the signal changed, the car rolled on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rested her head against the window, thankful Julian didn&#39;t press for an explanation. If she was honest,he probably didn&#39;t care enough to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rush hour in Kumvine clogged every street, but Julian still managed to get her to the company just in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She insisted he stop short of the entrance. The last thing she wanted was colleagues spotting them</p>
                
                
                
                <p>together and spinning rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the car came to a halt, Julian glanced over as Yvonne unfastened her seatbelt, ready to leave.He opened his mouth to say something, but she moved first, placing a small item in his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take this. It&#39;s scald ointment. Don&#39;t forget to useshe said, her voice low and sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand twitched back in surprise. The burn on his skin came from frying eggs that morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had she noticed it? Was that why she had rushed back earlier?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look on his face must have betrayed him, because Yvonne quickly averted her gaze, her tone clipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t read into it. I just don&#39;t like owing anyone,&#34; she explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could respond, she shoved the door open and slipped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian sat back, watching her retreat with hurried, uneven steps, her unease plain even from behind.Lowering his gaze, he studied the ointment.in his hand. Slowly, the corner of his mouth curved into a faint smile.</p>
