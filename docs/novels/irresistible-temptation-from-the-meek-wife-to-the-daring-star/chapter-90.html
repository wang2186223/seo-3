                <p>Yvonne hadn&#39;t even finished her thought when Julian&#39;s face hardened, the fleeting gentleness from earlier vanishing as though it had never existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cutting her off, he stared her down. &#34;We will never have our own children.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words fell sharp and final, like a judgment carved in stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief, her heart aching as though the affection she had just embraced had turned around and struck her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color drained from her cheeks as she whispered,&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments ago, he had swallowed his pride to explain what happened with Rita, which made her believe he truly valued her. That was why she thoughtshe could finally share her pregnancy,believing they could welcome a child like any couple in love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His rejection crushed that fragile hope, leaving her stranded in dismay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waited for answers, but Julian kept silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering his gaze, Julian said without a flicker of emotion, &#34;It&#39;s late. Go to sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne remained rooted to the spot, silent tears streaming down before she even noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, he had already stretched out on the bed,lying perfectly straight beneath a neatly pulled blanket. His features, handsome yet cold, looked as though they had been carved from ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne longed to cut him open, just to know whether a beating heart existed inside or if he was nothing more than a lifeless machine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding onto her side of the bed, she buried her face in the pillow. Her tears soaked through the fabric,  leaving her hollow and chilled to the bone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, it dawned on her-she must honor the bet and walk away from him. It was the only way to keep herself and her child safe. She could no longer allow herself to be swayed by the fleeting kindness he sometimes showed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne shut her eyes, only to feel unexpected warmth curling around her wrist-a hand, gentle and firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes snapped open, anger already rising as she prepared to shove him away. But before she could,Julian&#39;s voice broke the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sell anything you want, but you must never sell this bracelet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver ran down her spine, her whole body stiffening at his words. Julian clearly knew what she intended, yet nothing in his tone suggested he meant to stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne bit down on her lip and shot back with  defiance. &#34;You made me. If word gets out that you only put two hundred grand into the film, everyone will assume the Powell Group is sinking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low laugh escaped him, and that was when she noticed how near he was. The sound brushed against her ear, sending an unwanted shiver down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced her eyes shut, trying to shield herself from his nearness, bracing against the pull of his charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he leaned in even closer and murmured, &#34;If I&#39;m not backing your project, aren&#39;t you just going to find another investor? With the Powell name tied to the project, do you really think you&#39;d have trouble drawing investors?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, her thoughts came to a standstill.The implication landed, and everything snapped into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was simple. Nothing in the contract forbade her from securing outside investment.  All the same, she blamed him for starting off with such a miserly budget. His stinginess had stirred her anger so fiercely that she had overlooked the obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had handed her a way out, but she wasn&#39;t about to reward him with gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever hint of a smile she wore vanished as she rolled away from Julian, turning her back without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s brow drew tight behind her. He let out a quiet breath, leaned toward her side of the bed, and switched off the lamp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkness swallowed the room, and a gentle &#34;Goodnight&#34; drifted through the space between them.(</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With silence hanging heavy, neither one found any peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mattress was wide enough for three, leaving a gulf between them that felt colder than ice. Yvonne curled on her side, careful to keep the distance unbroken. She gave no reply, nor did she drift off. With her head propped against her hand,she stared into the empty blackness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her palm moved instinctively to her stomach, and as she closed her eyes, a single tear slipped free.</p>
