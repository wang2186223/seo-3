                <p>The shoot was put on pause. Out in the corridor Trevor leaned against the wall with Yvonne, enjoying his coffee while a cool breeze drifted by. His eyes flicked toward Rita, who was still surrounded by a crowd of eager flatterers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a scoff, Trevor muttered, &#34;Hard to believe Julian actually goes for someone like her. She&#39;s nothing but eye candy, and honestly, I wouldn&#39;t trust her as far as I could throw her. You&#39;re lucky you&#39;re sharp, or she would&#39;ve made your life hell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne just offered a knowing smile, keeping quiet. If Trevor had any idea that Rita was actually the woman who&#39;d come between her and Julian, he&#39;d probably be floored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once everyone&#39;s coffee was finished, filming resumed. Since Rita still couldn&#39;t get her scenes right, Braden suggested switching to some of the other key moments to keep things moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco,who understood that Rita&#39;s support behind the scenes was powerful but didn&#39;t want to waste time, quickly agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, that meant only Rita and Yvonne were left unoccupied while the rest of the crew worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the costume room, Yvonne was busy checking the wardrobe when Rita stormed in, her voice laced with disdain. &#34;I have to admit, Yvonne, you&#39;re even more sly than l expected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne didn&#39;t bother replying, choosing to focus on her task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita ground her teeth in frustration before flashing a sugary smile. &#34;But Julian, he&#39;d never let his real love do this kind of grunt work. He always takes care of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mentioning Julian finally made Yvonne pause. Her hands stilled on the hangers, and she turned to Rita  with a pleasant smile. &#34;Is that so? Then tell me, why aren&#39;t you Mrs.Powell yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment struck a nerve, and Rita lost her cool.She snapped, &#34;You bitch! If you&#39;d just signed the divorce papers, Julian would have married me ages ago!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne arched an eyebrow, her patience at its end.She let out a short laugh. &#34;Oh, you didn&#39;t know?I sent those divorce papers to Julian a long time ago.He&#39;s the one dragging things on. He was even at my place just last night. He wouldn&#39;t leave, no matter what I said.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s face froze, eyes wide with disbelief. She remembered all the times Julian had dodged her questions about divorce, and jealousy twisted in her gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she refused to let Yvonne see her falter. &#34;Don&#39;t kid yourself. If Julian actually wanted you, why hasn&#39;t there been a child?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow passed over Yvonne&#39;s eyes. Of course, enemies always knew where to aim, and Rita&#39;s jab had landed right on her most sensitive spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita, sensing victory, continued with a self-satisfied grin, &#34;Julian hasn&#39;t cut you loose because the timing isn&#39;t right. The Powell family&#39;s future will belong to me and my child. There&#39;s no way he&#39;d let someone like you walk away with half of everything. The moment my baby arrives, you&#39;ll be tossed out of the Powell family with nothing to your name!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words might have shaken Yvonne before, but after her talk with Julian last night, she found herself willing to believe in him, if only a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Yvonne shot Rita a mocking smnile. &#34;Drop the act. Julian told me himself last night that the child you&#39;re carrying isn&#39;t his.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita went pale, her anger soaring until she wwas nearly retorting fiercely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian had sworn to keep her secret, vowing never to expose the truth of her pregnancy. He&#39;d agreed to shoulder the blame and let everyone believe the  baby was his. But now, he&#39;d gone and told Yvonne everything!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to recover, Rita sneered, &#34;And you just take his word for it? Men will say anything to get what they want. If it isn&#39;t his, why does he treat me so well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s eyes grew serious. That question had always gnawed at her, too. If Julian had nothing to do with Rita&#39;s child, why would he go so far for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the look on Rita&#39;s face gave Yvonne more reason to believe there was something she hadn&#39;t uncovered yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, she decided to trust Julian&#39;s word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small, confident smile, Yvonne replied, &#34;The truth doesn&#39;t concern me. Now I have work to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left the costume room, registration form in hand,not giving Rita another glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s fingers clenched into fists, rage twisting her features. Then, just as quickly, a cunning smile appeared. She swept out of the room, made her way to the makeup area, and leaned in to quietly give the artist her next round of orders.</p>
