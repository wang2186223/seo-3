                <p>Callum&#39;s scream tore through the set as his body hit the floor and skidded a few feet away. Blood spilled from his lips, and panic flickered in his eyes when he realized one of his teeth had come loose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage boiling over, he pressed a trembling hand to his jaw and shot a murderous glare at his attacker. &#34;What gives you the right to hit me, Trevor?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cold stare, Trevor flexed his fingers, unmoved. &#34;You brought this on yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day&#39;s filming had been split across two sets. Braden, the male lead, braved the outdoor shoot under Trevor&#39;s lead, while Rita, unwilling to endure the rough conditions, chose to perform against a green screen indoors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Trevor hadn&#39;t doubled back for the gear he forgot, Yvonne might have been cornered once again, just as she had before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum,all bravado vanished, hunched his shoulders and stayed quiet. He never picked fights with anyone stronger,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco&#39;s brows knitted in disapproval as he snapped, &#34;Trevor, that&#39;s crossing the line. You&#39;re just being a bully now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Trevor let out a dry laugh. &#34;Funny. When Yvonne was surrounded and beaten, not a single word left your mouth.Where was your outrage then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs and uneasy glances rippled through the crowd. Rocco looked ready to explode, and Rita worked up a glistening tear, all wide-eyed and tragic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trevor, you&#39;ve got it wrong,&#34; she murmured, putting on a fragile act.vonne upset everyone. They only defended me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cut the act. Do you think I&#39;m blind? You shameless-&#34; Trevor&#39;s poatience snapped, and-the truth trembled on his tongue. But just before he spat out the word &#34;mistress,&#34; Yvonne reached for him and shook her head Baffled, Trevor clamped his jaw shut, still simmering, but respecting her silent plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His near-slip, however, made Rita&#39;s stomach chum. She cast a nervous glance at Yvonne, dread twisting inside her. Had Yvonne already told him everything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs rippled through the onlookers. Their gazes darted between the two women, restless and curious.What secret had Trevor nearly revealed? And what exactly was Yvonne hiding?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody said a word. Every person in the room seemed lost in their own tangled thoughts, and the tension thickened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne finally broke the silence by turning to Rocco, her tone gentle but firm. &#34;Mr. Duncan, you know as well as I do that if Julian hears about what happened here, nobody will come out of this looking good. I told you already. I only came to collect my things. Once I&#39;ve got them, I&#39;ll be gone, and you&#39;ll never have to see me again. Doesn&#39;t that work for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weighing his options, Rocco&#39;s expression darkened before he gave a grudging nod. &#34;Let&#39;s get back on track, people. Enough standing around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the spark of conflict gone, the crowd wasted no time scattering. Callum tried to blend in and slip away,but Trevor&#39;s sharp voice cut through the shuffle. &#34;You. Hold it right there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum froze mid-step, forcing a wobbly smile that only drew more attention to the gap in his teeth.there something else, Trevor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor pointed to the busted laptop on the floor. &#34;Breaking someone&#39;s computer and walking away? Not happening. Either you pay for the damage, or I get the police involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trevor, please! Ms. Ellis,it was an accident! I barely make enough as it is. Please, let me off the hook this once!&#34; Callum begged, bowing low, his voice breaking with desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered sneaking a peek at that laptop earlier. With that brand-new logo and sleek design, it probably cost more than half a year&#39;s wages. Exhaustion drained Yvonne&#39;s voice as she muttered, &#34;Let it go. I just want to be done with this,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief flooded Callum&#39;s face, and he stumbled over his thanks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor snapped, irritated, &#34;Then get out of here before I change my mind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum bolted, and the set grew quiet again. Trevor turned and caught sight of Yvonne crouched down,gathering the scattered things from her bag. His expression hardened as he crossed the floor and bent to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell them the truth? Thnat Rita&#39;s the mistress and you&#39;re Julian&#39;s wife?&#34; His confusion seeped into his sharp tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne hesitated, her hand hovering over the scattered items. She let out a hollow laugh.&#34;Mho would even believe me if I did?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, even to herself, it always felt like Rita fit the part of Julian&#39;s wife better than she ever could.</p>
