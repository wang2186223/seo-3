                <p>Just before shutting down her computer and heading out, Yvonne noticed an email lying quietly in her inbox.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, she didn&#39;t think it couId be from Vince. She opened it with a casuaI click, but when she saw the sender&#39;s name, her eyes widened in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, brimming with excitement, she dashed to the studio to find Trevor. In her excitement, she grabbed his hand, unaware of the gesture&#39;s boldness, and bounced with childlike glee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trevor! Vince Greville, the acclaimed award-winner,responded to me! He said he&#39;s very interested in the script and wants to meet to discuss it!&#34; she exclaimed joyfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor, caught off guard by her grip, stood rooted,barely processing her words, his eyes locked on their clasped hands. Nearby, the photography crew exchanged amused,knowing looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping out of it, Trevor cleared his throat to hide his fluster and flashed a wide grin. &#34;That is incredible! With Vince on board, casting will be a breeze. Actors will flock to work with him, even for less pay!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A script compelling enough to draw Vince was bound to be extraordinary, and Trevor could already imagine the buzz it would spark online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...&#34; Trevor&#39;s face clouded as he recalled some rumors, his tone growing cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Yvonne asked, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her radiant enthusiasm, Trevor shook his head, brushing off his concerns. Those were just unverified gossip, and he didn&#39;t want to dim her excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, just... I&#39;ve heard people at Warren Pictures can be pretty arrogant, so stay sharp,&#34; he said lightly. Yvonne nodded with a bright smile, unfazed. She was there to collaborate, not pick a fight, so their attitude didn&#39;t concern her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had braced for a long struggle, and this sudden opportunity was one she wouldn&#39;t let slip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warren Pictures was a titan in the industry, famed not only for Vince but also for launching numerous iconic stars. Many beloved films, endlessly discussed online, bore their name, making them a gold standard in filmmaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince had set a 10 a.m. meeting, and Yvonne arrived precisely on time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping into the Warren Pictures building,she was struck by its splendor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The decor radiated classic sophistication, with walls lined with posters and signed displays from global celebrities, and even some passersby were recognizable faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could fully absorb the scene, a friendly receptionist with a warm smile approached. &#34;Hello,may I help you? Do you have an appointment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m here to meet Mr. Vince Greville. He scheduled a 10 a.m. meeting with me,&#34; Yvonne answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One moment, please, while I confirm,&#34; the receptionist replied with a nod. Her smile remained courteous as she made a quiet phone call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, she looked up at Yvonne. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, miss, but Mr. Greville&#39;s agent says he has no appointments today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s impossible!&#34; Yvonne said, stunned, fumbling in her bag for her laptop. &#34;I can show you the email he sent...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss, we only recognize confirmed appointments,so please don&#39;t complicate things,&#34; the receptionist said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne froze, her face etched with disbelief. Vince had clearly arranged the meeting, so how could this Noticing the receptionist&#39;s unyielding expression, an idea struck her. She pulled out a film proposal embossed with the Powell Group logo. &#34;I&#39;m here representing the Powell Group to discuss a project with Mr. Greville and invite him to star in my film.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist&#39;s smile wavered, her demeanor turning wary. &#34;Miss, this isn&#39;t a place for scams or tricks. Please leave, or I&#39;lI call security.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne protested, &#34;I&#39;m genuinely here for a collaboration. The CEO of Powell Group is my...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, the receptionist picked up the phone. again. &#34;Security, there&#39;s a stalking fan of Mr. Greville here causing trouble. Please remove her.&#34;</p>
