                <p>Julian entered with confidence, clad in a custom-fitted suit that highlighted his imposing, statuesque frame.His gleaming dress shoes clicked purposefully against the floor with each step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he entered, a hush fell over the sprawling mansion. Not a soul stirred or uttered a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All attention locked onto Julian as he moved toward Yvonne, bending slightly to pull her into a warm embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers gently combed through her tangled locks,untidy from her desperate attempt to flee, his face radiating affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath his composed demeanor, however, Yvonne detected a chilling fury. This anger wasn&#39;t aimed at her but at Andrew, who had just slunk back, his face bruised as though struck, his spirit utterly deflated. &#34;Next time you want to go somewhere, just let me know, and I&#39;ll take you. Don&#39;t sneak off with someone else, alright?&#34; Julian murmured to Yvonne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andrew, realizing his error, stammered an explanation, but Julian&#39;s sharp, unyielding stare left him trembling, forcing him to bow his head in defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the exchange, Julian didn&#39;t so much as glance at Vince, who stood before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was filled with prominent, high-profile figures, yet Julian&#39;s presence reduced them to silence, their breaths shallow with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite Vince&#39;s own prestige and accomplishments,Julian&#39;s aura made him feel like an insignificant speck, unnoticed and irrelevant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught between dread and resentment, Vince mustered the courage to speak. &#34;Mr. Powell, l...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Julian&#39;s cold, commanding gaze silenced him, leaving him frozen, as if the air had been sucked from his lungs. He stood paralyzed, cursing his luck internally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts spiraled in disbelief-why was Julian here, at an event he would typically deem beneath him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A realization hit Vince, and he shot a wary glance at Yvonne, suspecting she hadn&#39;t exaggerated her ties to the Powell Group, perhaps even sharing a unique bond with Julian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Julian stepped closer, Vince, despite their similar stature, felt diminished, shrinking under his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you plan to hurt my woman?&#34; Julian&#39;s tone was glacial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince collapsed to his knees with a heavy thud, tears streaming as he begged, &#34;It was a misunderstanding,Mr. Powell! I had no idea she was yours! I wouId have shown her nothing but respect if I had known!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Julian unmoved, Vince scrambled toward Yvonne, pleading desperately, &#34;Please,tell Mr.Powell we&#39;re friends, that it was all in jest, alright? You wanted me for your movie, didn&#39;t you? I&#39;ll do it without a fee!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s view of Vince soured further; his sudden opportunism was repulsive. Recalling the ordeal, a wave of revulsion hit her, and she spat with contempt, &#34;I would never cast someone like you in my film!&#34; Had Julian not arrived when he did, her fate could have been dire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an icy glare and no trace of doubt, Yvonne turned to Julian. &#34;I don&#39;t know him, and we&#39;re definitely not friends. Do what you need to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince&#39;s panic surged, his frantic apologies accompanied by tears. &#34;Mr. Powell, please, don&#39;t kill me! I know I messed up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s eyes narrowed, taking in Yvonne&#39;s disarrayed hair and tear-streaked face, clear signs of her distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze grew frostier as it landed on Vince, his voice cutting like ice. &#34;No need for such drama. We live in a civilized world, so naturally, I won&#39;t kill you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Vince began to exhale, a group of impeccably dressed figures strode through the entrance, exuding wealth and authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mansion fell silent again, the gathered celebrities shrinking back, some lowering their gazes, others trying to blend into the shadowS.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These new arrivals were titans of the entertainment world, second only to Julian. Crossing any of them meant career suicide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately for these celebrities, those new arrivals were Julian&#39;s business allies, all eager to curry favour with the Powell Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching Julian, they asked with concern,&#34;What&#39;s going on, Mr. Powell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian glanced at Vince, who quivered like a frightened animal, on the verge of collapse, and gave a faint, chilling laugh. &#34;Nothing serious. I&#39;ve just learned Vince has no interest in the opportunities provided to him. Let&#39;s ensure he won&#39;t be bothered with such things anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message was unmistakable-Vince&#39;s career was over; he was effectively blacklisted from the entertainment industry.</p>
