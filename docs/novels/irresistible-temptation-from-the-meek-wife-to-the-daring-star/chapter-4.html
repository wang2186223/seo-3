                <p>Julian never returned that night,leaving Yvonne sitting on the bathroom floor with her back pressed to the cold wall, her eyes wide open until morning crept in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When dawn broke, the haze in her vision slowly cleared. She pushed her head up with effort, every muscle stiff and uncooperative. A sharp ache twisted in her abdomen, and even breathing felt heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An endless night of wrestling with her thoughts had carved one truth into her heart-Julian didn&#39;t care for her. Clinging to him would only destroy her spirit and endanger the child within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he despised the baby, then she would love it all the more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching the toilet for balance, Yvonne forced herself to stand. She staggered out of the bathroom and asked a servant to cook her something ligght.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff knew better than to meddle. They had long understood the strained bond between their employers and stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the sofa, Yvonne spooned porridge into her mouth,and with each swallow, a bit of warmth trickled back  into her frail body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her moment of peace ended when Sebastian Price,the butler, entered with two servants hefting a large canvas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bowed politely. &#34;Mrs. Powell, this is the painting Mr.Powell commissioned for his grandfather&#39;s birthday.Will you and Mr. Powell be attending the celebration together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart stuttered as the date struck her-Rodger&#39;s birthday. The marriage contract demanded she and Julian appear inseparable and they visit Rodger during holidays and family occasions, especially on this day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after the bitterness of last night, shecouldn&#39;t imagine standing beside Julian and pretending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Yvonne had no escape. She sent a message with trembling fingers, saying, &#34;Will you be going with me to the Powell Mansion for Rodger&#39;s birthday?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reply came. Her chest tightened as she forced herself to call him. The phone rang, then fell silent,unanswered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he was still in Rita&#39;s bed, too exhausted to pick up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, Yvonne&#39;s mind emptied, leaving her frozen in place. She forced her lips into a faint smile as she said, &#34;I&#39;ll head over ahead of him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sebastian gave a slight bow, his calm expression hinting that he had already expected her answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing not to dwell on it, Yvonne retreated to her room. The mirror reflected a face drained by a sleepless night, shadows etched beneath her eyes.She painted on foundation layer by layer,trying to hide what rest had failed to restore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she walked outside, the familiar car slid through the gates. The window lowered, and one detail struck her instantly-Julian wore clothes he hadn&#39;t left the house in the night before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lashes lowered as her hands curled tight, digging crescents into her palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was plain. He had spent the night with Rita,even taking the time to change into something from her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s voice broke through her thoughts. &#34;Get in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her teeth caught her lower lip before she responded,&#34;Sebastian can drive me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot her a piercing glance, his voice cold and cutting. &#34;Do you really want Grandfather to notice any trouble between us?&#34; The words lodged in her throat. With no choice, she opened the door and sat stiffly beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence pressed down inside the car, neither willing to speak first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sidelong glance at him made her stomach twist. His clothes, his uncharacteristic casualness, all carried Rita&#39;s fingerprints.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought sickened her. Her chest heaved, and suddenly she gagged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s brows drew together as he turned toward her,startled, but before he could ask anything,Yvonne snapped her gaze away and stared coldly out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided to match his silence, giving him the very treatment he had so often used on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive crawled by without a single word spoken between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the car rolled to a stop at the Powell Mansion&#39;s gates, she unfastened her seatbelt before it fully braked and got out, striding forward with quick steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian caught up in only a few strides, his hand closing firmly around hers. Irritation sharpened his voice.&#34;Enough of this. Do you want Grandfather to see us at odds and expect me to bend to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She inhaled deeply,shoving down her disappointment until only a brittle smile remained. &#34;Relax. I&#39;ll play the role. Rodger won&#39;t suspect a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips flattened into a thin, unyielding line. After a tense pause, he murmured indifferently, &#34;You&#39;d better mean that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coldness in his tone hollowed her out.Memories of nights spent yearning for him blurred her eyes with unshed tears, but she clung to one fragile hope.&#34;Then promise me something in return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brow creased, and her fists tightened until her nails bit her skin. Keeping her voice steady,she added,&#34;Cut ties with her. If we&#39;re going to act like an inseparable couple, we can&#39;t let whispers of your affair reach the family. It&#39;ll ruin everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as the plea left her lips, she hated how small it made her sound. Still, some stubborn corner of her heart wanted to salvage their broken marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Julian, it was nothing but another unreasonable demand. He gave a sharp,mocking laugh, preparing to bite back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could, a firm voice, aged yet commanding,drifted from inside the mansion. &#34;And what is it y/Ou two are discussing?” Rodger sat in his wheelchair, which was wheeled by Jordy Powell, Julian&#39;s father.</p>
