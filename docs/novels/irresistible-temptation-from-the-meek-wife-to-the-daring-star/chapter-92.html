                <p>With Trevor&#39;s crew secured, the primary obstacle to filming was resolved, rendering the remaining challenges more manageable. The most complex task still lay in selecting the perfect actors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that remained was to wait, as Yvonne had already broadcast her call for talent across multiple platforms. She favored thorough preparation over rushing to gather a lackluster people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regrettably, most online-sourced companies and performers were obscure and uninspiring, as truly gifted individuals rarely sought roles through such channels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne meticulously combed through these options while also proactively contacting prominent agencies and actors she deemed suitable for the parts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The responses were discouraging, with some even accusing her of being a con director using the Powell Group&#39;s reputation for fraudulent schemes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours ticked by with minimal progress, and Yvonne sat anxiously at her desk, staring at her monitor,unaware of Trevor standing behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This approach won&#39;t attract the right talent.People won&#39;t believe the Powell Group needs to chase investors-they will assume you&#39;re a fraud,&#34; Trevor remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rubbing her forehead, Yvonne gave a faint, bitter smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entertainment world was indeed cutthroat,prioritizing proven success and funding, leaving novices without mentors struggling to break through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compounding her challenges, Yvonne had already clashed with some industry figures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her exhausted look, Trevor hesitated before offering a reassuring grin. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Every journey starts with hurdles. Someone will see your potential and take a chance, just like I did!&#34; Moved,Yvonne murmured, &#34;Thanks, Trevor...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She now realized that her earlier optimism, which had believed a strong script would effortlessly draw a stellar team and yield a critically and commercially successful film, had been naive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reality revealed that each phase was riddled with practical conflicts of interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne understood Trevor&#39;s steadfast support likely stemmed from his loyalty as a friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day&#39;s setbacks had dented her confidence,but Trevor, sensing her doubt, gave her shoulder an encouraging pat. &#34;Keep your spirits up! We&#39;ve got this! I&#39;ll tap my network too. Let&#39;s do this together!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Greatly encouraged, Yvonne nodded with determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They split their efforts. Yvonne continued reaching out to agencies and actors, while Trevor contacted actors he knew to gauge their interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their persistence began to yield results. Amid the flurry of outreach, a spark of promise emerged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince Greville, a celebrated actor renowned for his captivating performances and charismatic presence,had headlined countless hits and amassed a devoted following.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, he had stepped away from acting years ago,reportedly uninspired by the scripts he encountered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince had once declared he would return for a project that truly excited him, even waiving his fee,regardless of the genre.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To facilitate this, his agent created an account for fans to submit scripts, which Vince supposedly reviewed diligently, replying to those that intrigued him and offering remuneration otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In three years, however, he had never replied to anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With little to lose, Yvonne sent her carefully revised and annotated script, more as a desperate gesture than with real hope, and promptly forgot about it. It wasn&#39;t until late that evening, as she prepared to leave the office, that she spotted a new email in her inbox.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in a Warren Pictures office, a distinguished and handsome man sat, absorbed in a script on his screen, his face etched with focus and intrigue.</p>
