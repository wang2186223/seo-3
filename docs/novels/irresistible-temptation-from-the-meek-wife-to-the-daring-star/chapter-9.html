                <p>The steady rush of water from the bathroom in Rita&#39;s apartment stirred a flood of suggestive thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing by the doorway, Rita held out a set of men&#39;s pajamas, her cheeks tinged pink as she gave a timid knock. &#34;Julian, I brought you something to wear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a short pause before Julian answered from within, his tone distant, &#34;Just leave them outside the door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Rita&#39;s smile faded, and disappointment flashed in her eyes. She glanced down at the pile of Julian&#39;s clothes, carelessly dropped by the bathroom entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expensive gray suit was marked by a large coffee stain, and his phone had slipped out of the pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of intrigue lit up Rita&#39;s eyes. At that moment,the phone buzzed and the screen illuminated. It was a message from Yvonne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pulse quickened as she cast a glance at the bathroom. Moving with care, she reached for his phone. The screen displayed Yvonne&#39;s message. &#34;Will you be home tonight? I need to talk to you about something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Rita,it was obvious what Yvonne was after; she scoffed at Yvonne&#39;s scheme, sure that Yvonne only wanted to lure Julian back to her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, mocking laugh slipped from Rita at the thought. She entered the password she&#39;d memorized after casually noticing it a few times when Julian wasn&#39;t careful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still on edge, afraid Julian might appear at any second,Rita decided not to linger. She hurried to open Yvonne&#39;s chat and typed. &#34;I&#39;m busy right now. Don&#39;t message me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sent the message with a hint of satisfaction,quickly erasing the chat history afterward. Just as she moved to slip the phone back into Julian&#39;s suit pocket,the bathroom door suddenly opened</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian stepped out, catching her red-handed, still holding his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita stood there, frozen in place, comforted only by the fact that she&#39;d already wiped the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at the phone in her hand, a deep frown settling on his face. &#34;What are you doing with that?&#34; Rita avoided his gaze, but her movements were swift as she passed the phone back with a look of feigned innocence. &#34;It slipped to the floor, so I picked it up for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian accepted the phone and went straight to the chat with Yvonne. The most recent message was his own, asking if she had reached the hospital, but she hadn&#39;t responded. Growing annoyed, he locked the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita,still wearing a wounded look, handed over the pajamas. &#34;I&#39;m really sorry, Julian. I was so careless with the coffee.Please change into these.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wrapped in nothing but a towel, Julian&#39;s broad shoulders and toned physique caught Rita&#39;s hungry stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when she&#39;d let him go, she never imagined she&#39;d regret it, but seeing him now, successful and striking,she refused to lose her chance again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Julian looked at the pajamas, his thoughts drifted. He remembered the way Yvonne&#39;s eyes lingered on him when he&#39;d worn something out of his character that morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange question popped up-was Yvonne feeling jealous? On a sudden whim, Julian reached for his coffee-stained suit and pulled it back on. He looked at Rita and spoke flatly. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. Since you&#39;re fine, I&#39;m heading home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s hopeful smile faded in an instant. In desperation,she wrapped her arms around his waist. &#34;It&#39;s already so late. Can&#39;t you stay with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her a stern look, then pulled her hands away with no hesitation. &#34;You&#39;ve gone too far, Rita.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frozen in disbelief, Rita could only watch as Julian left the apartment without so much as a glance back.Resentment slowly twisted across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when they were still a couple, Julian would never walk away from her like this. Now, though, his patience had clearly run out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, all of this was Yvonne&#39;s fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving to the window, Rita stared at Julian&#39;s car pulling away, a wicked smile curling her lips. &#34;I underestimated you, Yvonne. But don&#39;t get too comfortable. Sooner or later, Julian will be mine,and only mine.&#34;</p>
