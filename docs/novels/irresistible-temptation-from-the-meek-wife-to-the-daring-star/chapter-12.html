                <p>Julian&#39;s expression turned to stone as he stared down at the divorce papers. Without a word, he let out a dry laugh, snatched up the agreement, and tore it into pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shredded paper drifted to the floor, scattering everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula, standing off to the side, was visibly nervous.She kept her eyes on the floor, hoping not to draw any attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the tension in the air, Julian&#39;s next question came out steady. &#34;Where was this letter sent from?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula faltered, and her voice trembled, &#34;I,I don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian massaged his temples, realizing Yvonne would never make it easy for him to track her down if she was determined to keep her distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, she&#39;d gone overboard this time. Clearly,she wanted to make a scene, probably to get Rodger involved and take her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julían felt no guilt over his actions. To him, Yvonne  was simply blowing things out of proportion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden bark cut through the tension. Looking toward the door, Julian saw Morton arrive, holding a small puppy in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The puppy&#39;s irresistible charm drew a rare softness from Morton, and his usual sternness faded as he cradled it with a faint, gentle smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s mood, however, only worsened at the sight.The puppy was meant for Yvonne, and now the gesture felt hollow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Morton could come in fully, Julian waved him off. &#34;Forget it. Take the dog with you. I don&#39;t want it anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morton froze in disbelief.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After years of working for Julian, he still couldn&#39;t predict his boss&#39;s sudden changes in mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian had been thrilled about getting the puppy just yesterday, yet now he didn&#39;t want it at all. Had he gotten into a fight with Yvonne?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morton shot a glance at Paula, who gave a tiny nod.in response. The two exchanged a silent understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julían paid no mind to their quiet signals. His attention remained on the envelope, his mood growing darker  by the second. His tone was harsh as he barked out an order. &#34;I want Yvonne&#39;s location in one hour. No excuses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Kumvine Hospital, Yvonne and Spencer had just walked out to the front entrance. While making their way down the steps, she slipped and twisted her ankle,prompting Spencer to catch her at once, worry written all over his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He immediately asked, &#34;Did you hurt yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne pulled back gently, offering him a reassuring smile. &#34;I&#39;m alright. Thank you for everything these past few days. You can go back to work now, I&#39;ll manage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer flashed a lazy grin. &#34;My schedule&#39;s clear. Let me see you home.I insist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In reality, Spencer should have been preparing for an important medical conference in Soblon. His original flight was set for this afternoon, but just earlier, he pushed it back to another day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d let his chance with Yvonne slip away three years ago, convinced there wouldn&#39;t be another. But now that he knew she didn&#39;t have a happy marriage,he refused to sit back and let the same regret consume him twice. Noticing Yvonne&#39;s hesitation, Spencer gave the bag in his hand a little shake. &#34;These are your prenatal supplements. I can go over the instructions with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That left Yvonne with no good reason to turn him down, so she agreed. The moment she nodded,Spencer&#39;s face lit up and he set off with enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pointed toward his car with a spark of excitement.&#34;It&#39;s right over there. Come on, let&#39;s go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne fell into step behind Spencer. Their friendship went back years, and as he kept the conversation lively, she couldn&#39;t help but let out a genuine laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to her, Julian was watching from a distance in his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Julian had found out Yvonne was at the hospital, he had sped over without wasting a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had arrived just in time to catch sight of Yvonne smiling and chatting freely with another man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It struck him that he couldn&#39;t remember the last time she had looked at him with that kind of lively smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s glare grew frosty as he watched her, a humorless laugh escaping him. A surge of anger roiled inside him. She&#39;d really crossed a line this time, ignoring his messages, blocking his calls, vanishing from his life,and then sending him divorce papers. Was this all because she had found someone else? He&#39;d never been treated like this by anyone, let alone humiliated in such a way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze locked onto Spencer&#39;s car as it slowly reversed out of its parking space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Julian floored the accelerator and shot straight toward Spencer&#39;s car.</p>
