                <p>A subtle flicker passed through Rodger&#39;s gaze as he shared a fleeting, covert glance with Julian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, doubt pricked at him-had he gone too far? And why did Yvonne look as though she might burst into tears?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian steadied him with a composed look before remarking in an even tone, &#34;Grandpa, once Yvonne&#39;s ready to leave the hospital, we&#39;ll pack our luggage and head back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s eyes, rimmed with red, dropped as she nodded without resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Rodger&#39;s face light up. A broad smile spread across his wrinkled features as he declared cheerfully, &#34;Excellent. I won&#39;t impose any longer. I&#39;ve got a coffee appointment with the hospital director,so I&#39;ll be on my way!&#34; He lifted his hand in signal, and Paula quickly stepped forward, wheeling him out of the room with brisk efficiency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the next instant, silence settled again. Only Yvonne and Julian remained, the closed door leaving them alone with the weight of unspoken words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s brief sense of relief quickly soured as the reality sank in. Pressing her palm to her forehead,she whispered in disbelief, &#34;I can&#39;t believe I actually agreed to that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharing a roof with Julian again, right under Rodger&#39;s sharp, suspicious eyes-didn&#39;t that mean endless charades, day after day, pretending they were still the picture of a loving couple? The thought alone made her stomach twist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration bubbled over, and she shot Julian a sharp glare. &#34;How could you just stand there and say nothing? What if we slip and give ourselves away in front of him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian, unfazed, leaned back slightly, his voice steady and unhurried. &#34;Moving back isn&#39;t such a terrible idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, knowing smile played at the corners of his lips, as if he almost found her outrage amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicion flickered in Yvonne&#39;s eyes as she studied him. Julian hesitated, then explained with quiet sincerity, &#34;I just don&#39;t want Grandpa to be upset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was exactly the excuse she had expected. It left her no outlet for blame-Julian wasn&#39;t the one at fault. The only one she could resent was herself for being too easily swayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the choice sealed, regret settled over her like a heavy cloak. Her shoulders sagged, anda faint weariness dulled her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian sensed her mood faltering but couldn&#39;t come up with the right words. Instead, he lifted another spoonful of salad and held it ou. &#34;Do you want some more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot him a sharp look, irritation flashing across her face. &#34;Rodger isn&#39;t here now. Why are you still performing? Aren&#39;t you supposed to be working? Or is babysitting me suddenly your new job?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian offered no reply. He knew perfectly well how much work waited for him-Morton had already called several times, pressing him to return to the office for urgent matters. Yet he had ignored every call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian struggled for words. After a quiet pause, he set the bowl aside and murmured, &#34;Get some rest.I should head back to the office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne parted her lips, caught between irritation and reluctant amusement. She wasn&#39;t truly angry-just obstinate, yearning for a tender word of comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Julian looked almost relieved, as if her words had granted him permission to escape. He didn&#39;t even bother to invent an excuse. At her mention, he seized the chance immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her bright, expressive eyes clouded with annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning he head away with deliberate stubbornness, she muttered, &#34;Then go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mixture of defiance and hurt tugged at him, but Julian assumed her sulk still stemmed from the decision to return to the Powell estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mouth tightened before he tried, awkwardly, to soothe her. &#34;Don&#39;t trouble yourself over that film anymore. Just focus on resting. I&#39;ll line up another strong project for you to direct.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly,Yvonne turned her gaze back to him, her eyes searching. His sincerity made her chest tighten,yet part of her couldn&#39;t quite trust it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, he had swallowed his pride to comfort her, stepping into the role of a husband rather than a cold partner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had begun watching him with suspicion at every turn, yet now she found her certainty faltering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question that had been gnawing at her for days rose once more. Beneath the blanket, her fingers tightened into a fist, though outwardly she tried to look calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a trace of mockery in her tone, she asked, &#34;Tell me-why are you suddenly treating me so well?Julian, don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve actually fallen for me?&#34;</p>
