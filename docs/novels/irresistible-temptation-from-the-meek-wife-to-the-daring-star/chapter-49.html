                <p>Julian&#39;s unexpected arrival on set must have rattled the culprit, or perhaps they were simply careless.Either way, the surveillance cameras had been left unchecked,leaving evidence intact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morton queued up the footage and handed the tablet over cautiously to watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the screen, Julian appeared with Rita clinging to his arm, the crowd buzzing around them. Not far off,Yvonne stood alone, her expression lost and heavy,her eyes fixed on the scene before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pang of guilt pressed into Julian&#39;s chest. He hadn&#39;t realized she&#39;d been watching him that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The footage shifted, and another figure stepped into frame. The person shoved Yvonne hard from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian froze the image and zoomed in, revealing a woman&#39;s face twisted in rage. His brows knit tight. &#34;Find her,&#34; he instructed, his tone leaving no room for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away,&#34; Morton answered, already moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the emergency room, Yvonne stirred, her lashes fluttering as her eyes cracked open. Spencer was by her side, carefully tending to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he saw her awake, his expression softened.&#34;You&#39;re up. Feeling any better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her throat burned, each cough scraping raw from the water she&#39;d swallowed. The memory of sinking, of that suffocating darkness, clawed at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head quickly, fighting off the terror,and whispered hoarsely, &#34;What about the baby?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer&#39;s smile slipped, replaced with a grave expression. He hesitated, then said firmly, &#34;Yvonne, if you truly want to carry this child to term, you need to leave your marriage soon. If you don&#39;t, I suggest ending the pregnancy now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted, but no words came. After a long silence, she lowered her head, the weight of it all pressing down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the haze, one memory cut clear-Julian&#39;s arms pulling her up from the water, his body shielding hers beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in a long while, Yvonne felt as though she had been pulled back from the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t the type to dwell on grudges. Kindness,no matter how small, stayed with her. And Julian&#39;s quiet gestures of care chipped away at the walls she kept forcing up around her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Part of her braced for Spencer&#39;s scolding,expecting him to call her weak and foolish for wavering again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when his eyes met hers, there was no anger, only a heavy sigh. &#34;The baby&#39;s safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief had barely begun to wash over her when his tone sharpened. &#34;But listen carefully! A shock like this is too much for the child. If you&#39;d been without air for another minute, the baby would&#39;ve been gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s head dropped low, guilt pressing into her chest. Then, almost timidly, she glanced back up.&#34;Did... did he bring me here? Where is he now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A twist of pain crossed Spencer&#39;s face. He, who could once argue fearlessly before a room of scholars, suddenly found the words bitter on his tongue. At last he nodded. &#34;He&#39;s waiting outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing a slow breath, he continued, unable to hold back, &#34;Tell me the truth, Yvonne. What&#39;s happening between you and Julian? You swore you would divorce. Is he stopping you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips trembled before she whispered, &#34;I don&#39;t even know what we are anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart was torn in two. Julian&#39;s tenderness left her shaken, yet the shadow of Rita clinging to him cut her deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And still, when she thought of the way he had dived into the pool, the desperation in his eyes, it hadn&#39;t looked like pretense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Against her will, a fragile hope stirred inside her-that maybe, just maybe, Julian&#39;s feelings for her were real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer&#39;s chest tightened with a familiar ache, the sting of being pushed to thesidelines once more. Yet this time, he refused to surrender so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, he leaned forward and said, &#34;If you really want to uncover how he feels about you,let me help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne blinked, startled by the sudden offer. A faint smile tugged at Spencer&#39;s lips as he added, &#34;We can stage something-an act between us. It might be the only way to see where his heart truly lies.&#34;</p>
