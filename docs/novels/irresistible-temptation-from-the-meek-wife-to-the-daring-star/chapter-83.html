                <p>Light flooded the room in an instant, and the shadow that had loomed nearby transformed into something familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian stood there with his brows drawn together,looking faintly annoyed. &#34;It&#39;s just me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s scream died in her throat, and then relief washed over her. With a quiet huff, she muttered,&#34;What on earth are you doing skulking around here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There he was, perched in the dim office all that time,so it was no wonder she nearly jumped out of her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came earlier this afternoon,&#34; said Julian as he approached, holding out a glass of water while his gaze lingered on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her throat dry, Yvonne accepted it, taking a cautious sip. Behind the rim of the cup, she whispered, &#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, her mind raced with questions. He&#39;d come earlier this afternoon? That meant he must have been watching her napping. What if she had mumbled in her sleep or shifted in some ridiculous way?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While her mind churned, he slid a small plate into view. A neat slice of cake sat on it, sweet and inviting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost as though reading her confusion, Julian explained, &#34;I only stopped by to bring this. You were sleeping,so I stayed busy with some paperwork.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The implication eased her nerves-he hadn&#39;t been putting all his attention on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a breath she hadn&#39;t realized she was holding, then studied the cake with a strange mix of gratitude and hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a quiet pause, she teased, &#34;You&#39;d make a decent househusband,you know.&#34; Never before would she have pictured Julian not only preparing food for her but showing up with dessert as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of his recent efforts made it difficult for her to cling to old grudges. Scooping up a spoonful of cake, she masked her unease with casualness and asked, &#34;Doesn&#39;t this ever wear you down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It struck her as odd-a man as busy as Julian,pressured from every angle, still finding time to play the part of caretaker. Surely he must feel the strain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not,&#34; Julian answered instantly, without the slightest pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Yvonne lifted her head, only to find his gaze already fixed on her. His eyes held a depth she couldn&#39;t quite unravel, layered with emotions he rarely let slip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice dropped as he added, &#34;I&#39;m just trying to walk in your shoes, living the life you had for those three years.&#34; Her chest tightened, and a storm of memories crashed through her. She turned away, unwilling to let him see how shaken she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For three years, her entire world had spun around Julian. Her own identity seemed to dissolve as she existed only to meet his every need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mornings always began with her bustling in the kitchen, making breakfast he&#39;d barely touch. Every day, she&#39;d pack his meals and try to bring them to his office, but Julian never invited her upstairs. Morton was always sent down to collect them, and eventually, Morton-always polite-suggested she stop. The implication was clear: the meals never reached Julian and probably ended up tossed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sting of it pressed hard against her throat, and she blinked quickly to stop the tears. Clearing her voice, she deflected with a question. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you wake me when you arrived?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s lashes lowered as he murmured, &#34;You finally looked like you were resting well.&#34; He remembered too well how easily her sleep could be disturbed. Even the slightest movement late at night would rouse her, no matter how quiet he tried to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he&#39;d left her undisturbed, selfishly enjoying the rare sight of her finally at ease. For once, he had wanted the afternoon to stay quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief silence passed before Julian&#39;s tone shifted,tentative. &#34;What do you think of this office?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He almost sounded nervous, waiting for her approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne studied him, suspicion flickering in her eyes,then answered flatly, &#34;It&#39;s not bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faintest curve touched his lips, but he kept his expression guarded. &#34;I&#39;m glad. It was thrown together in a hurry, and plenty of things still need to be added.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicion narrowed her gaze, and she studied him carefully. &#34;So you&#39;re admitting you arranged this whole office for me?&#34; A trace of panic crossed Julian&#39;s eyes, betraying him before he could compose an excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp crack of Yvonne&#39;s palm on the desk broke the moment. Her teeth clenched as she spat, &#34;Don&#39;t pretend to be generous. Why don&#39;t you tell me the truth about that two-hundred-thousand budget?&#34;</p>
