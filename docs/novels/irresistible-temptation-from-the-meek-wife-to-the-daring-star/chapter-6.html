                <p>Yvonne felt weak after retching, her knees still trembling as she lifted her gaze to the mirror.The pale,worn-out facestaring back at her made her chest tighten. With a heavy sigh, she splashed cold water over her face, then dabbed on a quick layer of makeup to cover the fatigue before stepping out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last thing she expected was Julian waiting at the door. He stood against the wall with a lazy elegance,arms folded, one leg crossed over the other, as though he had been there all along. A knot of unease tightened in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could decide what to say, he held out a crisp handkerchief,its faint scent startlingly fresh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, she took it hesitantly. &#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s eyes, dark and unreadable, fixed on her. you sick? I heard you were nauseous during the gathering yesterday too. I&#39;ve already arranged for you to see a doctor this afternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath faltered. She wanted to refuse,but his tone left no room for choice-it wasn&#39;t a suggestion but a command. Without waiting for her response, he turned and walked away,leaving her rooted to the spot, her mind spinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now was the worst possible time to reveal her pregnancy. Julian already had Rita carrying his child,and with the family&#39;s affection leaning toward that woman, she was certain he would choose Rita over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drifting through a haze of worry, Yvonne slipped out of the bathroom and wandered down the hallway. Her steps slowed as voices of Jordy and Sharon floated from the study, tension sharp enough to stop her in her tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t meant to eavesdrop, but Jordy&#39;s frustration echoed into the hall,impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why bring Rita here of all days? Are you trying to humiliate Yvonne on purpose?&#34; asked Jordy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon sounded close to tears, her voice brittle. &#34;Do you honestly think I wanted this? Rita confided in me -she&#39;s expecting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence followed. When Jordy finally spoke,his disbelief was clear. &#34;Are you telling me Julian&#39;s the father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon&#39;s voice dropped to a hush, yet every word was edged with certainty. &#34;Julian took her to the hospital just days ago. If the child isn&#39;t his, why would he go to such lengths?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A weary sigh slipped from Jordy. &#34;I never imagined Julian and Rita would cross paths again, let alone reconcile. And there is Yvonne-I feel pity for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon&#39;s answer came without hesitation. &#34;Whether we like it or not, Rita carries Julian&#39;s child. He never cared for Yvonne, and I doubt he&#39;d want a child with her. This baby must be protected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordy&#39;s tone hardened, leaving no room for debate.&#34;Yvonne can&#39;t know. If she finds out now,it will only humiliate her further.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What neither of them realized was that Yvonne had already heard enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frozen at the study door, she felt her heart cave in at the confirmation that Rita was indeed carrying Julian&#39;s child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terrified they might notice her, she scrubbed the tears from her cheeks and fled down the hall, her chest tight with grief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she composed herself and rejoined the others in the living room, Jordy and Sharon had returned as well. Conversations halted, and all eyes landed on her, the air thick with awkward unease. Rodger&#39;s face creased with concern as he asked gently,&#34;Yvonne, you don&#39;t look well. Should I call my physician to check on you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced a quick shake of her head. &#34;There&#39;s no need, Rodger. The change in weather has just upset my stomach a little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita lingered nearby, her gaze sharp. A fleeting, cold smile flickered at her lips. She had done her investigation and uncovered the truth-Yvonne was pregnant. It was news she swore the Powell family could never be allowed to discover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her return carried only one goal-to take Yvonne&#39;s place and become Julian&#39;s wife, no matter the cost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Yvonne hiding her pregnancy, she would be a fool not to exploit the opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought in mind, she slipped a small bottle of pills from her handbag, arranging her features into gentle concern. She stepped toward Yvonne and said sweetly, &#34;Yvonne, you should try this if you&#39;re not feeling well. Dr. Carter&#39;s team created it. I used to struggle with stomach issues, but ever since I started on this, I&#39;ve barely felt sick at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon&#39;s lips curved into a smile as she added warmly,&#34;If Dr. Carter&#39;s team developed it, then it must be reliable.&#34; Rita&#39;s eyes widened innocently, though her voice carried a subtle edge. &#34;There&#39;s just one thing-it&#39;s not safe for expectant mothers. It can cause miscarriages.But of course, you can take it, Yvonne... you&#39;re not pregnant,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell into silence as every gaze shifted to Yvonne. In one breath, Rita had cornered her completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s fingers curled into her palm, hidden from view, though her lips lifted in a calm smile as she accepted the bottle. &#34;Thank you, Rita. I&#39;ll take it later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita urged, &#34;You shouldn&#39;t wait-take it now, and you won&#39;t have any stomach pain later. Let me fetch you some water.&#34; She hurried to pour a glass and placed it before Yvonne with exaggerated care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the family, Rita&#39;s actions looked full of kindness.But to Yvonne, Rita&#39;s eyes told a different story-sharp with challenge, glinting with malice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne narrowed her gaze slightly, though her lips curving upward. &#34;Alright then, I&#39;ll take it now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the weight of everyone&#39;s stares, she slipped a pill into her hand and lifted it toward her mouth.</p>
