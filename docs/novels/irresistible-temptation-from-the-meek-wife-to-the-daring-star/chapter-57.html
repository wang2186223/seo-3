                <p>Yvonne blurted out almost too quickly, &#34;No need!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words slipped before she remembered Rodger&#39;s presence. She forced her lips into a smile and added more softly, &#34;I&#39;m fine now. My hands aren&#39;t injured.There&#39;s really no need to trouble anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger narrowed his eyes, his stare so sharp it felt as if he could peel back the layers of her thoughts.&#34;Tell me, Yvonne-are you and Julian always this polite with each other at home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body stiffened instantly, her pulse quickening in alarm. She darted a glance at Julian, who looked just as rigid, the tension written across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s voice dropped, the weight behind his words impossible to ignore. &#34;Don&#39;t tell me the affection between you two is nothing but an act for my sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The accusation struck like a hammer, leaving both of them reeling. Yvonne didn&#39;t dare push back this time.She lowered herself into the headboard quietly, while Julian turned to Rodger with a composed smile. &#34;Of course not. Yvonne&#39;s just a little shy when you&#39;re around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping her head bowed, Yvonne pretended at bashfulness, though her stomach was knotted tight,terrified he would press further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her relief, Rodger&#39;s suspicion eased. He let out a hearty laugh. &#34;Good. That&#39;s good. Yvonne, go ahead and eat. I won&#39;t leave until I see you finish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell into silence. Julian lowered his gaze,picked up the spoon, and calmly scooped salad into it. He held it to her lips as though the gesture were the most natural thing in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no choice, Yvonne opened her mouth,swallowing the salad reluctantly. But the next moment a jolt ran through her, shocking her to her core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian leaned closer, his thumb brushing across her lips to wipe away a trace of sauce. His voice dropped to a husky tenderness.&#34;Alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart hammered wildly, her nerves nearly breaking under the intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she lifted her eyes, she found herself drowning in his steady, gentle gaze, a devotion so convincing it rattled her to her core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rushed to her face. She quickly looked away,drawing in a shaky breath before whispering, &#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her ears burned crimson, betraying her even as she tried to compose herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s mouth curved ever so slightly, a shadow of a smile. He lifted another spoonful of salad with practiced care and offered it to her. &#34;Eat some more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne forced herself to comply, bite after bite, all the while wishing she could simply inhale the whole bowl and end the charade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger, seated nearby, observed with a look of satisfaction, nodding slowly as though pleased with his own handiwork. His chest swelled with smugness,but he wasn&#39;t nearly done meddling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Old age hadn&#39;t dulled his senses. He&#39;d heard whispers of the rumors outside. If there was a rift between Julian and Yvonne, he knew mere appearances wouldn&#39;t fix it. He needed to press harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice took on a plaintive, almost frail tone.&#34;Yvonne, would you consider staying at the Powell estate with Julian for a while?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne stiffened at once. Her eyes darted toward Julian, silently pleading for him to intervene. Yet he looked down at the bowl as though he hadn&#39;t heard a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw tightened, but she forced her lips into a polite smile. &#34;Rodger, I&#39;ve just started working... l might not have the time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy sigh slipped from Rodger, his brows sagging in feigned sorrow. &#34;I understand, child. If you can&#39;t, then you can&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He broke into a violent cough, covering his mouth with a trembling hand, before offering her a weary smile. &#34;You young ones have your own paths to walk.I won&#39;t stand in the way. It&#39;s just... I&#39;m not sure how much longer I&#39;ll be around. My only wish is to see more of the two of you together while I still can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words pierced Yvonne&#39;s heart, pulling at the most fragile corners of her emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her parents&#39; faces flashed before her eyes-time she had squandered with them, time she could never reclaim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rodger, please don&#39;t say such things.&#34; Her voice cracked as she brushed tears from her cheeks.&#34;You&#39;ll be with us for many more years. And I promise -I&#39;ll move back to the Powell estate.&#34;</p>
