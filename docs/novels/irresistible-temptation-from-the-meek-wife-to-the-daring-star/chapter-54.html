                <p>Liam had once stood as Grayson Hawthorne&#39;s right hand,who was the head of the Hawthorne Syndicate,the most feared mafia in Reshuoce. Yet beyond that ruthless reputation, Liam had also been Julian&#39;s trusted friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, when Julian was quietly expanding his empire under the radar in Reshuoce, enemies had cornered him and nearly ended his life. It was Liam who had stepped in, dragging him from the edge of death. That debt had never left Julian&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three months ago, Liam had decided to sever ties with the mafia, walking away from Grayson&#39;s empire in search of a normal life. His defection enraged Grayson, who unleashed the full force of his wrath to hunt Liam down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that same time, Rita had justdiscovered she was pregnant. By the moment Julian rushed to Liam&#39;s side, the betrayal had already been answered in blood. On his deathbed, battered and fading, Liam had seized Julian&#39;s hand and entrusted him with his final wish-protect Rita and the child she carried, shield them from Grayson&#39;s vengeance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was that promise that had bound Julian to Rita,forcing him to endure her mistakes time and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, she had crossed a boundary that could not be ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s gaze turned to ice as he leveled it at her. His voice was low, carrying a hard edge. &#34;I&#39;ve allowed you to remain by my side, but you shouldn&#39;t have laid a hand on my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were mine first! You belonged to me before anyone else!&#34; Rita&#39;s voice cracked into a shrill cry.She stumbled closer, desperation twisting her expression, and lifted a trembling hand toward Julian&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brittle laugh escaped her lips as she pleaded, &#34;Julian, stop pretending you love that woman-you don&#39;t. You love me. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve already forgotten the love we once shared!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian shifted aside, her hand swiping through empty air. The very mention of their past only stirred bitter amusement in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp, humorless laugh slipped from his mouth, his tone cutting as he said, &#34;I don&#39;t need you to remind me.I remember it all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rage and sorrow had long since burned out,leaving only clarity. He recalled every detail as if it had happened yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, he had rejected his family&#39;s money and struck out overseas with nothing but grit and ambition. In that foreign land, he met Rita, and they had fallen fast, believing it to be love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just when he had been ready to confess his true identity and place a ring on her finger, she betrayed him-falling into the arms of his closest friend,Liam-sneering that he was too poor to ever give her a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had even demanded their relationship remain hidden, treating his poverty like a disease that couldn&#39;t see the light of day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of her secrecy, Liam never learned about Rita&#39;s history with Julian, and when Julian saw how deeply Liam cared for her, he chose not to reveal the truth. Then Rodger fell gravely ill, forcing Julian to return home and marry Yvonne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, he had been content in his marriage. If not for Liam&#39;s sudden accident, Rita might never have resurfaced in his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she discovered who he really was, her entire attitude shifted. Julian noticed it immediately, yet he remained too indifferent to call her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of her betrayal flickered across Rita&#39;s face, tightening her features before she forced out a wounded tone. &#34;If you truly feel nothing for me anymore, then why did you let me stay by your side in the first place? From the moment I came back, you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>arranged everything for me. Anyone would have thought it meant something, wouldn&#39;t they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian ignored her question entirely, his voice flat as stone. &#34;Back in Reshuoce, Liam saved my life twice.The first debt was cleared the day he declared his relationship with you. This time, I&#39;m protecting you and the child only to settle what remains.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t wait for her reaction. Bending down, he laid a plane ticket on the table and added coolly, &#34;Go to Briysil. I&#39;ll continue supporting you financially. But if you insist on staying here, I&#39;ll give you one last sum of money, and after that, we cut all ties. Decide carefully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those final words, he strode out without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s legs gave way, and she crumpled to the floor,tears spilling as sobs shook her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bitterness welled up inside her-she hadn&#39;t asked for much. She only wanted comfort, security, a better life. Between love and wealth, who wouldn&#39;t make the same choice she had?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then why... why did it feel like she had committed some unforgivable sin?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita convinced herself that if Julian hadn&#39;t hidden his true identity when they first dated, she never would have strayed with Liam. Liam might have come from an old noble family in Reshuoce and held the position of Grayson&#39;s trusted subordinate, but his wealth still couldn&#39;t rival the Powell family&#39;s fortuine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, her fate was sealed the moment she chose the wrong answer! Over her dead body would she screw up the same way twice. This time, she swore she would cling tightly to Julian-and to the immense power and riches of the Powell family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought burning in her chest, Rita pushed herself upright, snatched the plane ticket from the table, and deliberately ripped it into shreds, letting the pieces flutter to the floor.</p>
