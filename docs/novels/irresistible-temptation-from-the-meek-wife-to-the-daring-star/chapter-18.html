                <p>The snow-white puppy sprawled lazily on the bedroom floor, its dark, curious eyes never leaving Yvonne as she moved about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her suitcase and began sliding in her neatly folded clothes, each motion methodical yet absent of energy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The task ended quickly, leaving her staring at the stacked fabric in silence until a sharp, self-mocking laugh slipped past her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her love for Julian had consumed her to the point of erasing herself, and now she realized how pitifully little in this house could truly be called her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t keep enduring. If Julian refused divorce,Rita would soon appear, pressing him to force her into giving up the child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resolve hardened in her gaze. One hand moved protectively to her abdomen as she whispered, voice steady with quiet defiance, &#34;Baby, I won&#39;t let anyone hurt you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint whimper from the puppy broke through her thoughts. Her expression softened. Bending down,she scooped the little creature into her arms, burying her face in its silky fur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice dropped into a tender murmur. &#34;And you-would you like to come with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The puppy licked her cheek with boundless enthusiasm,drawing a startled laugh from Yvonne. Stroking its soft fur, she decided then and there to name it Snowy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lighthearted moment was cut short by a sudden knock at the door. The smile drained from her face as she turned toward it. &#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula stepped inside, lips parting as if to speak-only for her gaze to land on the open suitcase. Whatever words she had prepared slipped away in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Powell, why... why are you packing?&#34;she asked,her voice faltering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s mouth pressed into a tight line, torn about how to answer. She had already resolved to divorce;there was no point lingering in this house,living only in Julian&#39;s shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Julian still refused to sign the papers, she had made up her mind. She would move out on her own terms and carve a fresh path for her career.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne knew that if she confided in Paula, the woman would do everything possible to stop her. Yvonne quickly steered the moment away. &#34;Paula,what did you come here for?&#34; she asked lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That snapped Paula back to herself. &#34;Oh-right!&#34; She lifted the bag in her hand with sudden purpose. &#34;You left this in Mr. Powell&#39;s car. He told me to bring it up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s eyes shrunk to slits,a cold rush of dread surging through her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Buried in that bag were pregnancy supplements-the ones Spencer had given her! Had Julian seen them?Had he discovered she was carrying a child? By sending Paula back with the medicine, was he silently warning her-to deal with the pregnancy on her own?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula&#39;s brows knitted, her tone tinged with confusion.&#34;Mrs.Powell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne forced her lipsinto a rigid curve, though her jaw felt stiff. &#34;Did he mention anything else?&#34; she pressed,trying to sound unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula shook her head lightly, her brows knit in bewilderment. &#34;No, nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s pulse quickened, panic drumming in her ears as countless possibilities churned through her mind.She accepted the bag from Paula, her fingers trembling, the weight of it amplifying her dread. If Julian truly had no intention of accepting this child,she would vanish overseas without hesitation, cutting every trail so he could only chase shadows without ever finding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than anything, she would shield the baby from harm-especially from Julian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that silent vow burning in her chest, she unfastened the bag. The instant her eyes fell on what lay inside, all her frantic thoughts froze solid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at the label with a flat expression, fingers brushing the cool surface as she muttered,&#34;Vitamin C?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bag held nothing else-just a few identical vitamin C bottles clicking softly together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth struck Yvonne at once-Spencer was behind this. Ever the cautious one, he had tucked her prenatal supplements into vitamin C bottles so Julian wouldn&#39;t suspect a thing, the disguise neat enough to pass any casual glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that realization, she let out a long breath, the tension draining from her shoulders as fatigue and relief settled in equal measure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently,Julian hadn&#39;t found out after all! Before she could gather herself, a sharp knock rattled the door. Sebastian&#39;s voice filtered through, calm but formal. &#34;Mrs. Powell, Ms. Adams is here to see you.&#34;</p>
