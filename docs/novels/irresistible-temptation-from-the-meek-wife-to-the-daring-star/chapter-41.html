                <p>Yvonne wasn&#39;t someone who let personal feelings cloud her work, but after reading the script, she truly believed Rita didn&#39;t fit the part.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided to be upfront with Rocco. &#34;Mr. Duncan, l don&#39;t think the casting for the female lead is right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Rocco and Brock immediately stopped their talk, irritation flashing across their faces as they turned to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco let out an impatient click of his tongue and shot back, &#34;Listen, kid, you&#39;re new here. What do you really know about movies? Saying something&#39;s wrong doesn&#39;t make it true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne kept her explanation direct. &#34;Rita&#39;s background is in modeling, not acting. Putting her straight into the lead isn&#39;t the best call. On top of that, her image clashes with the female lead&#39;s personality-&#34; She didn&#39;t get to finish. Brock slammed his hand on the table, shooting her a glare. &#34;That&#39;s enough! Who do you think you are, passing judgment when you&#39;ve barely set foot in this industry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, Yvonne realized she may have gone too far and quickly fell quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock, however, wasn&#39;t finished. With a mocking smile, he added, &#34;I see why you&#39;re so against Rita.It&#39;s no secret she&#39;s Julian&#39;s treasured wife, and he&#39;s the one funding this project just for her. It&#39;s only natural for you to be jealous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the color drained from Yvonne&#39;s face. She had no idea Julian&#39;s investment was for Rita&#39;s sake. If that was true, then why would Julian have her join TR Entertainment? Had he really not thought about the tension this might cause between her and Rita, or did he actually want her to suffer that humiliation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From an outsider&#39;s perspective, it probably looked like she was objecting out of nothing but spite, the &#34;other woman&#34; lashing out at the wife. A wave of irony washed over Yvonne, and a faint,mocking smile tugged at her lips. She recalled how Julian once claimed to despise favoritism and nepotism, yet here he was, making an exception for Rita.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was suddenly clear that Rita was the one he truly cared for, while she was left with nothing but empty promises and half-truths, just like the lies he spun last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she had an excuse, Yvonne slipped away from the studio and headed to the costume department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She now realized that life at the studio wasn&#39;t as miserable as she had expected. Her coworkers turned out to be friendly once she shared some tips on photography and filming. Even Trevor, the supervisor who always kept his distance, gradually warmed up to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching the costume room, Yvonne could hear laughter and cheerful voices coming from inside. Rita had shown up early, and the crew had gathered around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the rumors had been swiftly dealt with, the gossip was still buzzing. With gossip being second nature in their world, the entire crew had caught the buzz online and acted as though Rita was truly the mysterious Mrs. Powell. And even Rita herself hadn&#39;t bothered denying it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the staff asked with curiosity, &#34;Rita, now that you&#39;ve landed yourself a wealthy husband,why keep working? Doesn&#39;t Mr. Powell worry about you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shy blush colored Rita&#39;s cheeks as she answered quietly, &#34;I just don&#39;t want to end up as a housewife who knows nothing. That kind of life would make it easy for someone to toss you aside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words cut straight through Yvonne, and she suddenly understood the meaning behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor suddenly appeared at her side, his tone cold.&#34;It&#39;s true. Marrying into money changes everything.Even someone with no experience can land the lead role.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Rita basked in all the attention, Yvonne couldn&#39;t help herself. &#34;She&#39;s not Julian&#39;s wife,&#34; she said quietly.</p>
