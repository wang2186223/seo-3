                <p>Trevor moved through the set with purpose,checking the last of the arrangements before the cameras rolled. At Yvonne&#39;s words, he only curved his lips into a faint smile and let the moment pass in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealous words had reached his ears plenty of times before, and he had long since learned to dismiss them. Instead of dwelling on it, he gave Yvonne&#39;s shoulder a light pat and said warmly, &#34;Don&#39;t lose heart.I&#39;m counting on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he headed off to track down Rocco.Yvonne lingered, whispering encouragement to herself until her resolve steadied, then she made her way into the costume room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of cheerful chatter filled the space. Rita stood among the others, speaking with practiced sweetness, her face lit up with a gentle smile that never failed to charm outsiders. Yet the instant she spotted Yvonne at the doorway, her expression faltered, and the smile dissolved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the briefest second, stiffness pulled at Rita&#39;s features, and annoyance flared in her eyesalongside surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of last night&#39;s phone call still haunted her. Yvonne&#39;s sharp tone had unsettled her, and she hadn&#39;t been able to shake the unease long after the call ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Rita was quick on her feet. She smoothed over the crack in her composure and stepped forward with an air of delight. &#34;Yvonne! What a nice surprise.What brings you over here?&#34; she exclaimed as though nothing unpleasant had ever happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s thoughts turned sharp. She longed to expose Rita&#39;s shamelessness, the way she dared to claimn the lead role without even the talent to back it up. Yet unlike Rita, she couldn&#39;t bring herself to speak so boldly. Her lips pressed into a thin line, and she said nothing. The crew, eager to join in, turned their attention to Rita with voices thick with flattery. &#34;Rita, you know her? She&#39;s just helping the director, running errands for this project.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s eyes gleamed with calculation as she tilted her head. She stressed her words, making sure the sting landed.&#34;So you&#39;re only handling the errands around the set then...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group shared knowing looks, their smirks carrying a hint of mockery. Almost everyone remembered Yvonne&#39;s dazzling entry, Brock himself giving her a personal welcome. Yet within minutes she seemed to offend him, and her once-bright standing crumbled into dust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who didn&#39;t know the details weren&#39;t openly cruel, but they never bothered to treat her kindly either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s gaze lingered on Yvonne, and then she softened her tone, pretending to be sincere.&#34;Yvonne, my assistant isn&#39;t here today. Why don&#39;t you help me instead? It&#39;ll be much easier than running errands all over the place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers rippled through the room the moment Rita made the suggestion. Several pairs of eyes darted toward Yvonne, some glittering with envy, as though she had stumbled into a rare fortune by working alongside Rita.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Yvonne alone understood the truth behind the offer, and there was nothing generous about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mockery and jealousy buzzed around her like gnats,but she kept her composure and didn&#39;t flinch. When she finally spoke, her tone was even and steady.&#34;Ms.Adams, I think you should ask someone else. My responsibility is to assist with filming, not to run personal errands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing her gaze, Rita locked eyes with Yvonne,the silence between them heavy with challenge. Her expression softened foran instant, but then her smile twisted sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In that case,&#34; she said coolly, &#34;I&#39;ll have no choice but to tell Mr. Duncan we need to postpone filming. Without an assistant, things will slow down, and if we lose a day, you might be the one blamed for the damage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit like a slap, and Yvonne&#39;s jaw tightened as anger flared in her eyes. She hadn&#39;t thought Rita would stoop so low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around them, the crew broke into restless muttering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why fight it? Working for Rita is something most people would kill for. You&#39;re just running small errands anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, do you even realize what a delay costs? We&#39;re talking hundreds of thousands. Can you cover that?&#34;another chimed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The murmur of voices grew louder, painting Yvonne as selfish and ungrateful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Rita basked in the moment, her lips curving with smug delight as she watched Yvonne struggle under the weight of their stares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clenching her fists at her sides, Yvonne forced down the fury boiling inside her. A smile tugged at her lips at last, and she gave a short nod. &#34;All right. I&#39;ll do it.&#34;</p>
