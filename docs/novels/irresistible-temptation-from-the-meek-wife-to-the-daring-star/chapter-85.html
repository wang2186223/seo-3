                <p>Moments earlier, Rocco had wrapped up the day&#39;s shoot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite calling it a shoot, the whole production felt more like Rita&#39;s personal showcase, with everyone orbiting her and letting her, a complete amateur,dictate every move. The script changed whenever she felt like it, tossed aside at her whim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody dared to push back or complain. Keeping Rita happy had become their full-time job. No one forgot what happened to the two actors who&#39;d tried speaking up-they got bumped down to extras, not a single line left for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita strode into the underground parking lot, trailed by a pack of people eager to win her favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, that line you rewrote today was brilliant,Rita. Best Actress this year for sure!&#34; &#34;No doubt about it! If this film explodes at the box office,the credit will all be yours!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rocco&#39;s expression tightened, and he gave a sharp,deliberate cough that silenced the chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Rita basked in it all, drinking in the praise as though it were gospel. She lifted her chin, lips curving into a self-satisfied smile, while she pretended at humilty. &#34;Please, don&#39;t exaggerate.This film is a group effort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re far too humble, Rita...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a voice rang out, cutting through the fawning tones. &#34;Wait, isn&#39;t that Yvonne? Who&#39;s that man with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It looks like the CEO of the Powell Group...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words faded away, and glances darted uneasily toward Rita.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawn by the whispers, Rita glanced in the same direction. Her grin faded in an instant,replaced by a stormy glare. Just a short distance away, Yvonne and Julian approached a sleek car. Julian moved ahead, opened the door for her with a slight bow, and motioned for her to get in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne slid into the car, her expression frosty, never acknowledging Julian&#39;s gesture. Julian seemed amused, smiling to himself as he circled around and took the driver&#39;s seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching them, it was impossible to miss the air of casual intimacy, as if they were a couple with no idea the whole world was watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian and Yvonne gave no sign of noticing the stares aimed their way. The car engine growled, and within seconds they were gone, leaving only a haze of exhaust in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence weighed heavily on the group. Rita&#39;s face remained stone still, and no one dared to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable! Mistresses nowadays strut around like they own the world!&#34; Rocco suddenly cursed,breaking the silence. His eyes darted to Rita&#39;s stiff expression, his voice rising with outrage. &#34;You can&#39;t let this slide, Rita! Mr.Powell&#39;s just handing her everything on a silver platter. She even rode up in the private elevator that&#39;s supposed to be yours-the one for the Mrs.Powell! The nerve!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs of agreement rippled through the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it, Rita! She strutted around, telling everyone the top floor would be her new office. You should put her in her place!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! That space is yours, Rita. Are you really going to let her take it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way does Yvonne deserve that kind of treatment! It&#39;s yours, Rita, yours alone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flattery swelled louder, drowning the air, but none of them caught the flicker of shame in Rita&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita curled her lips into a fragile smile and replied softly, &#34;Let it be. If Julian wants her to have the top floor, fighting over it will only make me seem small.An office is just an office. If she wants it, then let her take it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were crafted to perfection-casting herself as generous while quietly painting Yvonne as greedy. Instantly, the crowd&#39;s sympathy deepened,and disdain for Yvonne multiplied. Their insults turned harsher, their loyalty to Rita firmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind that gentle smile, howNever, her jaw tightened until her teeth ached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flicked one last resentful look in the direction Julian and Yvonne had disappeared. Her hands balled into fists, nails biting into her palms,yet even pain could not smother the venom burning inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was Yvonne, a woman with such a tainted name,allowed to snatch up everything she had been denied? That thought clawed at her, and she vowed in silence that sooner or later, it would all be hers to claim.</p>
