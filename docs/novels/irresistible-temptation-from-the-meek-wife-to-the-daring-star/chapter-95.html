                <p>At the entrance to an exclusive Kumvine club,Andrew flashed his VIP card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharply dressed waiter scrutinized it, then offered a courteous smile and a slight bow,ushering them inside. &#34;This way,please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne and Andrew entered, her brow furrowing as she took in the opulent surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The club&#39;s decor screamed wealth, and it was evident that only the elite gained entry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is Kumvine&#39;s most indulgent spot, Club No. 9,&#34;Andrew said, pausing to glance at Yvonne with a sly grin. &#34;Money alone isn&#39;t enough to get you in here-you need influence or fame. Anything service you desire,you can have here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s expression hardened. &#34;What&#39;s your game,Andrew?&#34; He didn&#39;t respond, striding ahead, leaving her no choice but to trail him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After navigating a maze of corridors, they reached a lavish private villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vince is hosting a big party here tonight,&#34; Andrew announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The party was in full swing-soft music floated through the air, a champagne fountain bubbled, and elegantly dressed guests mingled with polished smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed like a standard high-society affair, not particularly extravagant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne grew more baffled by Andrew&#39;s intentions.Uninterested in the party&#39;s allure, Yvonne brushed off Andrew&#39;s presence and retreated to a quiet corner, nursing a drink while her eyes searched the crowd for Vince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was filled with familiar faces-celebrities renowned for their charitable deeds and warmth, much like Vince, mingled with heirs of affluent families, some of whom Yvonne recognized from past events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, as she had never been introduced as Julian&#39;s wife in public, she remained a stranger to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she observed, a vague unease gnawed at her.After a moment&#39;s reflection, she pinpointed its source.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guests&#39; smiles radiated a disturbing excitement,like addicts craving their next hit or predators eyeing vulnerable prey. Their fervor felt darkly unsettling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne wondered if Andrew&#39;s vague insinuations were clouding her judgment. Then, she realized he had slipped away-he had been beside her moments ago, chatting with someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick glance around failed to locate him, so she shook it off, choosing not to fixate. Her sole aim tonight was to connect with Vince, and that was enough. Just then, a burst of fervent applause broke her thoughts. Turning toward the sound, she saw a man in a mink coat, cigar clenched in his mouth,being escorted to the villa&#39;s center by an adoring entourage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked to be in his late thirties, his mature,striking features at odds with the ostentatious coat.Yet, his eager smile, matching the crowd&#39;s, twisted his demeanor from refined to menacingly eerie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne stood frozen, stunned. This was nothing like the Vince she recalled from his on-screen persona.What had changed in his years away from the limelight?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stare must have been too intense, as Vince&#39;s gaze locked onto hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the villa echoed with applause, every eye turned toward Yvonne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped back, a shiver running through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scene felt ripped from a horror film. Then,Vince approached with a sly grin. &#34;Are you the one Andrew brought along? His latest fling? Quite a catch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His indifferent tone clashed sharply with the gracious actor Yvonne remembered, once lauded by the press as a paragon of respect toward women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swallowing her discomfort, Yvonne steadied herself and said, &#34;Mr. Greville, I&#39;m here to offer you the lead role in my film.&#34;</p>
