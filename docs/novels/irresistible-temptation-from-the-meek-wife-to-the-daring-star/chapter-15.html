                <p>Yvonne shook with fury, but when her gaze locked on Julian&#39;s eyes, the fire in her chest guttered out, leaving only a hollow ache. A broken laugh escaped her lips.&#34;Julian... I&#39;m tired of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lingered onhis face-the man she had clung to,loved fiercely for three long years. Her voice softened with regret. &#34;I never should&#39;ve forced you into this marriage. That was my mistake. I know now you don&#39;t love me, and I won&#39;t chain you anymore. Gofind your happiness. Just... let me go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s expression hardened, his mouth curling into a cold sneer. &#34;Since when did you learn to play this kind of game, Yvonne? You&#39;re only talking like this because there&#39;s another man, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands clenched, her eyes flashing. &#34;Do you really not understand plain words?&#34; Anger stirred beneath the grief in her chest, because no matter what, this man could always rattle her-whether it was joy or rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved into a bitter smile.&#34;If you&#39;re allowed to crawl back to your old lover, why shouldn&#39;t I be free to find someone new?&#34; Yvonne had once tiptoed around Julian, careful not to breathe wrong in his presence. Now, the sharp retorts rolled off her tongue with startling ease, leaving her with a strange, almost liberating lightness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her defiance,however, sent Julian&#39;s temper spiraling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, he could brush off her protests as nothing more than a wife&#39;s complaint, harmless bickering between spouses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time she had crossed the line-she had admitted, without shame, to her involvement with Spencer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage stripped him of control. His hand clamped tightly around her throat, forcing her chin upward until her eyes locked with his. With his other hand, he traced the corner of her lips in a deliberate, mocking caress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice dropped into a cold, scathing whisper.&#34;So that&#39;s it? Spencer gets his thrill stealing another man&#39;s wife? Tell me, Yvonne... Have you already slept with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s eyes flew wide, shock freezing her in place.A heartbeat later, Julian&#39;s mouth crashed against hers again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was called a kiss, but it carried no warmth-just raw fury searchíng for release. No matter how desperately she twisted,his grip only grew harsher. He pinned her wrists above her head, deepening the brutal contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest burned as if every trace of oxygen had been stolen away. Her mind reeled in a blank haze, leaving only the punishing pressure of his lips to remind her she was still conscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once,she would have been both giddy and thrilled by Julian&#39;s desire. Now, tears blurred her vision as she struggled uselessly against his grasp,her whole body trembling in resistance. &#34;Let me go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her muffled plea was swallowed,turning the clash into a battle for air, for dominance, for control neither was willing to yield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Julian drew in a ragged breath, finally releasing her and swiping the blood from the corner of his mouth. Yvonne&#39;s glare burned with blazing wrath and suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp laugh broke from Julian, his eyes dark with simmering rage. He shoved open the door,and stepped into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the passenger door unlocking sent a jolt of dread through Yvonne&#39;s chest. When the looming shadow fell across her, she instinctively shrank back to the other side. his arms, and strode forward without hesitation. Only then did Yvonne realize the car had already rolled to a stop inside the villa&#39;s courtyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian stormed straight into the bedroom, and Yvonne&#39;s heart leapt in panic. She hammered her fists against his chest, thrashing in desperation. &#34;You jerk -put me down!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He complied with ruthless ease, flinging her onto the plush bed. His gaze burned, tinged red like that night when lust had consumed him beyond reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terror rippled through Yvonne as she scrambled back,arms instinctively guarding her stomach. &#34;Julian, I don&#39;t want to...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her protest died when he lunged forward,tearing off his tie with one hand while prying her legs apart and hoisting them over his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As long as we&#39;re not divorced, you&#39;re still my wife,&#34;he growled, his voice low and unyielding.</p>
