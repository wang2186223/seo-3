                <p>&#34;Yvonne,would you bring me some water?&#34; said Rita when a shoot finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yvonne, can you pass me my jacket?&#34; said Rita when break came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From morning until noon, Rita&#39;s spiteful demands for Yvonne echoed nonstop around the set.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By lunchtime, Yvonne hadn&#39;t even found a spare minute to sit down and catch her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious Rita was retaliating for last night&#39;s call,pushing her limits and hoping to see her snap in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Yvonne refused to let Rita get the upper hand.She bit her tongue, kept her head down, and handled each task Rita threw her way, no matter how petty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every order Yvonne dutifully fulfilled, Rita&#39;s frustration only grew, and her attempts to embarrass Yvonne became more creative and more malicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Yvonne scramble around the set, Rita&#39;s eyes sparkled with a hint of satisfaction. Suddenly,she stood and addressed the team, &#34;You&#39;ve all worked so hard today! Coffee&#39;s on me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crew erupted into cheers, falling over themselves to praise Rita&#39;s generosity and charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a practiced smile, Rita turned to Yvonne,pretending to look troubled. &#34;Yvonne, everyone&#39;s swamped right now. Would you mind grabbing the coffee for everyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne lifted her eyes, her expression unreadable,as the crew exchanged uncertain glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were more than a hundred people on set, how could anyone expect Yvonne to carry that many coffees alone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone watching could see that Rita was making things as difficult as possible for Yvonne. Seated behind the monitors, Rocco recalled Brock&#39;s earlier tip and decided to play dumb, pretending not to notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the crew kept quiet, unwilling to risk Rita&#39;s wrath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the camera crew looked uneasy, and Trevor&#39;s frown deepened as he prepared to intervene. But before he could, a calm and friendly voice cut through the tension. &#34;I&#39;ll go with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man who spoke up was Braden Hanson, the film&#39;s leading actor and currently the industry&#39;s hottest star, who had just snagged a Best Actor nomination and was the heartthrob every woman on set whispered about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His unexpected offer left the crew stunned, and Rita&#39;s eyes narrowed with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne hadn&#39;t expected Braden to step in, but she also knew that as long as Rita had a chance to stir up trouble, she&#39;d keep finding new ways, and Braden wouldn&#39;t always be there to shield her. With a polite smile, Yvonne turned him down. &#34;I appreciate it, Mr. Hanson, but filming&#39;s about to start.We shouldn&#39;t disrupt the schedule. I&#39;ll be fine on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Braden looked momentarily surprised, ready to offer more help, but Yvonne simply flashed him a polite smile, bowed her head, and walked away. He stood there,silently watching her go, deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Rita&#39;s sour expression, Rocco quickly tried to restore order, urging everyone back to their places so filming could continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the shoot was anything but smooth. Just as Yvonne had anticipated, Rita&#39;s inexperience was obvious-no matter how patiently Braden tried to guide her, she couldn&#39;t slip into character. Scene after scene, she switched between exaggerated innocence and stiff vulnerability, forcing everyone to redo the takes over and over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After severaI failed attempts, even Braden&#39;s patience wore thin. &#34;Ms. Adams, did you even read the script?&#34; he finally asked. &#34;The lead is supposed to be strong, not helpless. That look doesn&#39;t fit the character at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears gathered in Rita&#39;s eyes, threatening to spill,when the sudden sound of rolling wheels drew everyone&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of the humiliating scene Rita had imagined,Yvonne fumbling with dozens of coffee cups, Yvonne appeared with a small cartloaded neatly with drinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the awkward silence, Rocco stood up and clapped &#39;his hands. &#34;Alright, everyone&#39;s earned a break. Help yourselves to coffee!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crew broke out in cheers and swarmed around Yvonne,grateful for the treat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor joined Yvonne, handing out coffee cups, and murmured under his breath, &#34;Smart thinking. Looks like Rita&#39;s run out of tricks for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s smile was bright and genuine as she glanced at him, sharing an unspoken understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the while, Rita stood off to the side, glaring at Yvonne with thinly veiled resentment simmering in her eyes.</p>
