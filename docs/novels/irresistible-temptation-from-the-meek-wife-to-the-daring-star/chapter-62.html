                <p>Yvonne slipped into Julian&#39;s car, shoulders slumped and spirit heavy. Without saying a word, he offered her a towel. She barely patted her cheeks before letting it fall to her lap. She pressed her forehead to the cool glass and watched the world blur past, her eyes dull with sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian watched her quietly, suspicion flickering across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had tipped off Frey about Spencer refusing the chance to study overseas. That was why he&#39;d shown up early. Even so, he stayed back, not wanting to intrude on their goodbye. Still, he couldn&#39;t heIp but think she was taking it harder than necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words came out colder than he intended. &#34;So Spencer leaving is really that big of a deal to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the question left his lips, regret flashed in his eyes. For once, the man who always seemed to have the right words slipped up and exposed his agendas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s head snapped around, and suspicion crept into her voice. &#34;How do you even know he&#39;s going abroad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something clicked for her, and anger quickly replaced her confusion. &#34;Did you do something to make him leave all of a sudden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept his silence, but his expression gave him away. She stared at him, shock and betrayal mingling in her eyes, before swinging her hand toward him. &#34;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;d stoop so low!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer had always treated her kindly. Now, Julian wanted to strip that away too. The injustice of it stung.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before her hand could connect, he caught her wrist, holding her in place. He looked herin the eyes,voice steady but gentle. &#34;Spencer was going to leave eventually. Would you really ask him to stay just for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her anger faltered, her hand falling back to her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t stop there.the youngest neurosurgeon in the country. He stayed in Kumvine because of you, even turned down a chance to study overseas. Did you think the Briggs family would just sit by and let that last forever?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite their differences, he couldn&#39;t deny Spencer&#39;s talent. With the right experience, Spencer would make waves in medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears clung to her lashes. She never realized how much Spencer had given up for her sake. If she&#39;d known,she might have pushed him to chase his dreams abroad too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she could understand the reasons, she couldn&#39;t forgive Julian for making choices for others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, she unfastened her seatbelt and lunged for the handle, only to find the door stubbornly locked.Frustration crept into her eyes as she faced him. &#34;Let me out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a sigh, rubbing his temple. &#34;You&#39;re still upset with me, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, her voice steady.&#34;I need to buy flowers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The real reason for her discharge tugged at her heart. This was the same day her parents had left her years ago. It was never just another date on the calendar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian, lost in his own thoughts and ambitions, likely didn&#39;t care. Spencer, the only one who always remembered, was already on his way out of the country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that realization, a wave of loneliness crashed over her. For another year, she was the only one who would visit her parents&#39; graves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could dwell on it, he leaned across the center console, his presence suddenly overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened, caught off guard. &#34;What are you doing? Stay on your side!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on her, intense enough to make her pulse race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A part of her braced for something unexpected, half-suspecting he&#39;d do something foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she heard a quiet click as he buckled her seatbelt once more. He straightened and faced forward,his voice cool. &#34;No need for that. The flowers are already in the back. I&#39;ll take you straight to the cemetery.&#34; Gradually, her racing pulse slowed, leaving her breathless for a different reason. Embarrassment prickled across her face as she tugged at the buckle, unwilling to meet his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, Julian, you don&#39;t have to come with me,&#34; Yvonne replied, barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, the engine purred to life and they rolled out into the street. Julian kept his hands steady on the wheel, taking extra care with every turn, as if he remembered all too well how things went wrong the last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne gripped the seatbelt with white-knuckled hands, heat creeping up her cheeks. It finally dawned on her just how bold Julian could be when he wanted his way.</p>
