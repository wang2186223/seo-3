                <p>The shocking scene froze Yvonne in place, her ears ringing as if the world had muffled into a distant hum,pierced by raucous cheers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, she turned her rigid neck toward the spot where the figure had crashed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the villa&#39;s second floor, an impeccably dressed crowd gathered, their excitement palpable as someone uncorked a champagne bottle, fueling their wild applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne recoiled in horror, struck by their callousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could they revel with such joy when a person seemed to have died before their eyes?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abruptly, the supposedly lifeless figure sprawled on the ground convulsed in agony, jolting Yvonne with shock, though she quickly discerned the person was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>still alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He labored to lift himself-it was a teenage boy, with slightly wavy, lengthy hair, potentially striking in appearance, though a gash on his forehead,oozing blood,masked his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crimson stream trailed down his cheeks, staining his worn, threadbare garments, giving the deceptive impression of a ghastly, lethal wound that had tricked Yvonne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Yvonne stammered, her throat tight with nerves, poised to ask about his state when raucous cheers exploded from the upper floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Check that out! That bastard is tougher than he looks! He is still alive!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Greville, can the party begin now? Is this woman part of the wager?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s eyes narrowed as she stiffly turned to see Vince and his entourage emerging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince&#39;s eyes glinted with a sly grin. &#34;This is Andrew&#39;s woman. We owe him some courtesy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd groaned in disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;However...&#34; Vince continued, sparking their curiosity with a wicked shrug. &#34;This venue is vast, and I can&#39;t monitor every corner. With him absent, a little lapse is only natural, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group roared in approval, their predatory gazes fixed on Yvonne, as if she were prey ripe for the taking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice boomed from the balcony, &#34;Ladies and gentlemen, let the games begin! The highest bidder can take the two lambs home tonight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos erupted, leaving Yvonne disoriented. What bids? What did &#34;take the two lambs home&#34; mean?What sort of event was this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, she noticed the teenage boy beside her tense at the sight of Vince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sudden burst, he lunged at Vince, growling like a vengeful wolf pup consumed by rage. &#34;You monster! You will pay for my sister&#39;s death!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The teenage boy barely got near before a wall of bodyguards halted him mid-stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince&#39;s mouth twisted into a mocking smile as he scoffed, &#34;Kid, let&#39;s set the record straight. Your sister sold herself for money. She willingly became a prostitute. How can you pin that on me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The teenage boy&#39;s eyes blazed with fury, tears spilling uncontrollably as he wailed in anguish.&#34;Why?Why wasn&#39;t it enough to kill my sister? Why destroy me too? Don&#39;t the poor have a right to exist?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right, the poor have no place in this world!&#34;The smug response came from the haughty guests surrounding them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of Vince&#39;s hand, the bodyguards seized the teenage boy, dragging him towards the luxurious champagne waterfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, his head was plunged into the gushing liquid. His eyes bulged in panic as he thrashed violently to break free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elite guests watched with glee as his struggles weakened, as if death were imminent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s blood ran cold, memories of her own near-drowning in the swimming pool flooding back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, a surge of bravery welled within her,and without a second thought, she charged forward,toppling the champagne structure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liquor flooded the ground, and the teenage boy gasped faintly, like a fish teetering on the edge of survival.</p>
