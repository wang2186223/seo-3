                <p>Rita clutched her forehead, leaning into Julian&#39;s arms and murmuring about dizziness before coaxing him to take her home. The act left Yvonne and Rodger alone in the hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s smile dissolved, her lips unable to shape even a polite curve. Rita&#39;s little performances were always so transparent, and she couldn&#39;t believe Julian didn&#39;t see through them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, no matter how many chances life gave him,he would crawl back to Rita and cast her off like trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sting in her eyes warned of tears, though she forced them back. She didn&#39;t want to reveal too much weakness before Rodger, but he was a sharp man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on her, gentle yet probing. &#34;Yvonne,did you and Julian get into a fight?&#34; he asked softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head moved in a quick denial, but his disapproval was obvious. &#34;Trying to fool me again? Look at you-you&#39;re pale, thinner than before. Tell me the truth, is that scoundrel giving you a hard time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, her fingers brushed her own cheek,realizing the hollowness there. Since the pregnancy, food had lost its appeal, and restless nights had carved shadows under her eyes. With everything pressing down on her, of course she looked completely wrecked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what would be the point of confiding in Rodger?Could he make Julian stay, or force him to care? The answer was already written in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne cast a longing glance toward the doorway,knowingthat if Rodger tried to pressure Julian on her behalf, it would only drive him further away and crush any hope of a willing divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the direction of her gaze, Rodger appeared to realize what was happening. &#34;Is this about Rita?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t respond, and he let out a slow sigh.&#34;Yvonne, I know you&#39;re upset that Rita came back and reunited with Julian. But trust me-there&#39;s no future for the two of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression darkened as old memories stirred.&#34;Everyone in the Powell family carries their pride in their bones. None of us would ever fall for someone who betrayed us before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows lifted slightly as she pressed, &#34;Rita betrayed Julian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until now, she had only heard they were an inseparable pair abroad. She had assumed Julian  returned home because Rodger forced him into marriage, which explained his disdain for her. She never imagined there was more behind their breakup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger gave a firm nod, cleared his throat,and seemed ready to reveal the truth-when the hospital door swung open and Julian strode back inside,catching them both off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s sudden move caught Yvonne off guard,especially wwhen his arm slipped casually over her shoulder as though it belonged there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa, we&#39;ll head home now,&#34; he said lightly,addressing Rodger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s gaze flickered nervously before he gave a stiff nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne shifted uneasily under Julian&#39;s hold and queried in a low tone, &#34;Didn&#39;t you send Rita back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I waved a taxi over for her,&#34; he replied, narrowing his eyes at her. &#34;Didn&#39;t you want to talk to me about something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flustered, Yvonne turned her face aside. Catching the exchange, Rodger&#39;s voice cut in, firm with reproach,&#34;You heartless brat, treat Yvonne properly! Money isn&#39;t everything-start paying more attention to your wife!&#34; Julian, ever the obedient grandson in front of Rodger,inclined his head with practiced submission. &#34;Alright,Grandpa.I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger gave a polite wave of dismissal. &#34;Alright then,the two of you head home. I need some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no way to refuse, Yvonne walked out beside Julian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs at the hospital entrance, his hand remained firmly clasped around hers. She finally wrenched free,her tone sharp and cold. &#34;Rodger isn&#39;t here. You don&#39;t need to keep pretending anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s gaze flicked to her baggy clothes, the result of her weight loss. A shadow crossed his eyes before he sneered disdainfully, &#34;Seems like life&#39;s been hell for you since you walked away from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage exploded in her chest. How dared he throw such a thing back at her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AlL &#39;thanks&#39; to you!&#34; Her eyes blazed with fury as she fixed him with a hard glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian studied her pale but unyielding face in silence for a beat, then spoke abruptly. &#34;Give me a reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She froze, caught off guard. He pressed on, voice low and edged, &#34;Give me one reason strong enough to make me believe you truly want this divorce.&#34;</p>
