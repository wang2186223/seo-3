                <p>Once Yvonne handed over the signed contract,Morton nearly sagged with relief. A sigh slipped out,so heartfelt he almost looked misty-eyed, silently thanking Yvonne for ending his ordeal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he felt free from the burden of this impossible assignment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t have to worry about rent. The Powell Group owns the whole building,&#34; Morton said,managing a genuine smile. &#34;If you run into any roadblocks, just give me a call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then offered his thanks with sincerity and hurried off with his copy before Yvonne could change her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Morton disappeared, a wave of frustration settled over Yvonne. She leaned forward, resting her forehead on her palm as she glared at the contract,feeling like she&#39;d just been expertly outmaneuvered. Two hundred thousand-barely a fraction of what a third-rate star pocketed for a single day&#39;s shoot. How was she supposed to cast anyone decent with that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amateurs, perhaps. Yet turning amateurs into capable actors would cost her more time than she could afford.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made her exhale heavily, a muttered curse for Julian echoing in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what good was cursing? She had taken the challenge, and the only path forward was to fight her way through it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she gathered herself, dusk had already fallen. Rising to her feet, she stretched out the stiffness in her limbs and started back toward the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian might have given her a department of her own,but currently she still worked under Brock. Unlike Trevor, she couldn&#39;t simply walk away. She might have to avoid crossing Brock before her resignation. But luck wasn&#39;t on her side. The instant she stepped into the lobby, she spotted Brock in heated conversation with another employee. She angled her body, hoping to slip by unseen, but his eyes snapped to her at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face twisted with anger, and he barreled toward her. &#34;Yvonne! You dared to hang up on me? Do you realize the chaos you&#39;ve caused today? You-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Step aside. You&#39;re in my way.&#34; Yvonne barely paused, her voice chilly and unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blunt dismissal left him speechless. He turned to the employee nearby, asking in shock and disbelief,&#34;Did she just dismiss me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The employee nodded silently, and Brock&#39;s face flushed with anger. By the time he spun back around,Yvonne was already striding to an elevator where nobody waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock burst out laughing, disbelief written all over his face. &#34;Really, Yvonne? You think you&#39;re taking that elevator?&#34; Yvonne stopped in her tracks, turned with measured calm, and asked, &#34;Is there some sort of issue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of surprise moved through the group gathered by the other elevators.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hasn&#39;t anyone told her that elevator&#39;s off-limits?What&#39;s she doing over there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Probably because she&#39;s disliked by everyone here.I heard she...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While whispers spread, Brock folded his arms and sneered. &#34;That&#39;s the private lift straight to the penthouse. You need a special access card for that one. Even our boss doesn&#39;t have that kind of clearance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne tilted her chin, gave a brief nod as if considering his words, then resumed walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight made Brock&#39;s smirk falter. He sneered to cover it. &#34;Unbelievable. Do you really not know your place? Let me spell it out-this whole tower is Powell property, and Rodger once declared the top floor belonged only to his granddaughter-in-law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth hit Yvonne like a slap. So that was what Rodger left for her. Anger flared in her chest. She saw right through Julian&#39;s scheme- claiming Rodger&#39;s gift as if it belonged to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Brock continued his tirade, &#34;Doesn&#39;t matter how close you are to Mr. Powell, he&#39;d never let the likes of you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never finished the thought. Yvonne had already reached the elevator, pulled a sleek black card from her bag, and tapped it against the panel. A soft beep sounded.The doors slid open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock was frozen to the spot, mouth hanging open,unable to process what he&#39;d just seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps rippled through the crowd, wide-eyed disbelief written on every face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping inside, Yvonne turned at the last moment. A sly smile touched her lips as she addressed the gawking onlookers. &#34;By the way, that top floor? It&#39;s my new office.&#34;</p>
