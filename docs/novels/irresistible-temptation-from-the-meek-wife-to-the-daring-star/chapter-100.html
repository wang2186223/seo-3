                <p>Julian&#39;s threat to blacklist Vince from the industry was no mere warning-it was a devastating blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince knew this meant not only the entertainment world but every other sector would turn its back on him. It was a calculated move to strip him of all prospects, leaving him no place to stay in Kumvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed with dread, Vince scrambled toward Julian, his mind racing until he seized on a faint hope.&#34;Mr. Powell, I&#39;m tied to Warren Pictures. You and Mr.Pearson are close, aren&#39;t you? For his sake, please...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, invoking Andrew was a grave mistake.Julian&#39;s face darkened instantly, a cold, mocking chuckle escaping his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andrew, who had been treading carefully, lurched forward, tripping in his haste, and delivered a furious kick to Vince&#39;s chest, his voice thick with righteous anger. &#34;Shut up with your lies! Warren Pictures has already terminated your contract!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The swelling on Andrew&#39;s face slurred his words slightly, and Yvonne, who had been frustrated with him, couldn&#39;t suppress a flicker of amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian was likely the one who had left that mark on Andrew, wasn&#39;t he? Only Julian would dare to do such a thing, after all. Yvonne was certain of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After berating Vince, Andrew turned to Yvonne with a fawning smile. &#34;Yvonne, do you think this punishment is sufficient?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Yvonne nodded absently, at a loss for words. Julian let out a sharp, dismissive huff, took her hand, and led her toward the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the club&#39;s entrance, a sleek luxury car idled.Julian&#39;s grip on Yvonne&#39;s wrist was firm as they approached, but she wriggled free, murmuring,&#34;You&#39;re hurting me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened, pent-up emotions boiling over as he faced her with a stern look. &#34;Do you have any idea what kind of place this is? How could you come here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s mind flashed to the chaotic scenes inside the villa-the raucous cheers, the bloodied teenage boy crumpled on the floor. Her face paled, fear creeping in, but she refused to back down in front of Julian,jutting out her chin. &#34;Well, you&#39;re here too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her defiance caught him off guard, leaving him momentarily speechless. He reached into his pocket,pulling out a pack of cigarettes to steady his nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could light one, Yvonne&#39;s sharp voice cut through. &#34;No smoking!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of cigarettes brought back the memory of Vince exhaling smoke in her face, filling her with revulsion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian, who rarely smoked and never in Yvonne&#39;s presence, had only grabbed the pack in his agitation,craving the calm nicotine might offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her command, he slipped it back into his pocket, exhaling heavily as he looked at her. &#34;This club is notorious for its wild, shady dealings. It is backed by powerful people, operates on the edge of the law,and is full of dangerous chaos. You walked into this blind-it&#39;s not safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian couldn&#39;t help but feel a wave of relief that he had come here to discuss a project tonight and spotted Andrew at the entrance. That was how he learned Andrew had brought Yvonne here and then abandoned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he regretted not landing another punch to even out Andrew&#39;s swollen face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Julian&#39;s gentler tone, Yvonne felt a sudden rush of vulnerability. The fear she had suppressed surfaced, her voice quivering. &#34;I get it now. Vince...he&#39;s nothing like his public persona...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words faltered, choked by emotion. Julian drew her into his arms, his hand softly patting her shoulder. Unable to hold back, Yvonne&#39;s tears spilled over, her quiet sobs shaking her frame. She had been terrified, her hands trembling as she had brandished that video to fend off her attackers.Without Julian&#39;s arrival, she didn&#39;t know how she would have survived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clinging to him, Yvonne let her tears flow freely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the soft night sky, Julian gently smoothed her hair, his gaze brimming with unspoken tenderness.</p>
