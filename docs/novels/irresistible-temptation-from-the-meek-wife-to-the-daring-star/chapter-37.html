                <p>Yvonne&#39;s cheek brushed lightly against the back of Julian&#39;s hand, soft and delicate,almost silken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting second, his mask of cold detachment slipped. He nearly reached for her hand-until she jolted awake to what she was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snatching her hand back, Yvonne edged away, her gaze sharp with suspicion. &#34;How did you get in here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time,she could chalk it up to him stealing her key. But tonight, she&#39;d been at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened as the warmth of her touch vanished, the fragile calm between them collapsing back into tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s fingers curled at his side, betraying the sting of disappointment he refused to admit. His reply came out icy. &#34;You think it&#39;s hard for me to get a key?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her anger flared. &#34;That&#39;s trespassing! You barged in without permission!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mocking laugh left him. &#34;Permission? I don&#39;t need an invitation to walk into my own wife&#39;s home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word &#34;wife&#34; hit her like a slap For a moment, she went silent, stunned. Then the day&#39;s headlines rushed back, and her lips trembled into a bitter smile as tears welled. &#34;Julian, how long are you going to keep playing with mne? Isn&#39;t this enough already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows furrowed. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne drew in a shaky breath, fighting to keep her voice steady. &#34;I saw the news. You&#39;ve already made it official with Rita. Stop humiliating me. I can walk away with nothing; I won&#39;t disturb either of you. Just don&#39;t drag this out by refusing to divorce me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her composure cracked, tears spilling as she looked at him with eyes full of hurt, fragile but pleading.&#34;Please... isn&#39;t that enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian froze,lher words lodging in his throat. He stared at her, grief and prottest burning in his chest, yet no words would come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Last, Juliam broke the silence, his voice low.&#34;What if I told you the headlines were nothing but lies?Would you evem believe me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne blinked, her breath catching. Disbelief colored evely word. &#34;Those photos aren&#39;t fake I can tell theyiereal</p>

The paparazzi snapped it, and the rest spiraled into what you saw online.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne didn&#39;t answer right away. Suspicion lingered,yet deep down she knew Julian had never wasted energy on lies where she was concerned. He had no reason to. And that truth unsettled her most of all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would Julian ever bother spinning lies for a woman he didn&#39;t love? The thought cut Yvonne deeper than she cared to admit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a heavy silence, her voice rasped out, raw and trembling. &#34;But Rita&#39;s child... it&#39;s yours, isn&#39;t it? I saw you with her at the hospital for her prenatal check-up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t keep dodging it. The truth had to come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s brow furrowed as realization dawned. At last,he understood the source of her torment-she had been carrying the belief that Rita&#39;s baby belonged to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated, his words careful, measured. &#34;I can&#39;t reveal much about her pregnancy, but the child isn&#39;t mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Her wet lashes lifted, eyes searching his face with disbelief. A sigh slipped from him, weary. &#34;You&#39;re making this more complicated than it is. My connection with Rita isn&#39;t what you imagine. Don&#39;t let it eat at you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question clawed at Yvonne&#39;s throat-then what exactly was she to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before the words could leave her lips, Julian shrugged off his jacket, rolled his neck with a weary stretch, and spoke in a tone that carried quiet command. &#34;I&#39;m worn out. I&#39;ll take a shower. Bring me a towel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath caught, and she bolted upright, eyes wide.&#34;Hold on! You&#39;re staying here? This is my apartment!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian paid her no mind as he walked straight into the bathroom without another word. Yvonne clung to the blanket, feeling a knot of worry tightening in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What on earth was he thinking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she tried to make sense of it all, his phone began ringing from inside his jacket. Yvonne paused,taking it out and eyeing the screen. The name &#34;Rita&#34;flashed in bold letters. Yvonne picked up and brought the phone to her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s voice was gentle, almost like a whisper. &#34;Julian,I can&#39;t fall asleep...&#34; Without thinking, Yvonne drew in a slow breath. She answered in a chilly tone, &#34;If you&#39;re having trouble sleeping,call someone else. Don&#39;t bother my husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went silent.</p>
