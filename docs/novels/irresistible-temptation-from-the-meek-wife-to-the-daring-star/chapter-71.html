                <p>It was deep into the night when Julian finally returned home. The villa stood hushed beneath the nightsky,its usual hum of servants gone, Rodger&#39;s retreat to bed left the corridors draped in a hushed, almost otherworldly silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Julian spotted the bedroom light glowing softly through the crack in the door, the sharp edge of his weariness dulled. That simple warmth washed over him, smoothing away the day&#39;s irritation and replacing it with a rare comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, he even felt grateful for Rodger&#39;s arrangements-grateful for the quiet life they&#39;d carved out here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After their painful time apart, he had come to understand how precious it was to return home late and find someone waiting, a lamp still burning on his behalf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He eased open the door. A cheerful nursery rhyme floated through the air, light and playful against the stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne, dressed in fitted yoga clothes, had slumped against the bed, her chest rising in steady rhythm,already surrendered to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian silenced the music with a brush of his hand, then leaned over to tuck a blanket around her shoulders.A faint smile tugged at his mouth as he studied her peaceful face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It amused him to discover that Yvonne&#39;s bedtime music had shifted to lullabies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint fuzz shadowed her otherwise smooth cheek, and Julian felt a ripple stir through him. Watching her sleep, he thought Yvonne looked as gentle and innocent as a baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost without realizing it, his hand lifted, fingertips grazing her face in a tender stroke. The skin beneath was soft and warm, a sensation that lingered pleasantly against his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She twitched at the tickle, her brows knitting briefly, yet she didn&#39;t wake. Instead, she-reached out in her sleep, tugging Julian&#39;s head into her arms as if cradling something small, her fingers ruffling his hair. With a drowsy murmur, she whispered, &#34;Snowy, don&#39;t be naughty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stiffened instantly, completely at a loss, caught against the warmth of her chest.Awkwardness tightened his breath, but he dared not move, letting her mistake him for that mischievous puppy as her hand drifted lazily over his hair again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after a long stretch did Julian manage to shift carefully, adjusting his body until he had her tucked securely in his embrace. With a steady, soothing rhythm, he patted her shoulder, settling into the familiar comfort of holding her close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne instinctively nestled closer in her sleep, and the two drifted through the night tangled in each other&#39;s arms. She slept straight through until daylight poured across the room, nudging her awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stretching lazily, her hand brushed against something firm. Her thoughts stalled as she twisted around, only to find Julian&#39;s chest exposed beneath the loose collar of his pajamas, his muscles stark against the morning light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight left her breathless, her head light and her heart racing. Dazed, she lifted her gaze to meet Julian&#39;s.He was propped on one elbow, watching her with a quiet smile curving his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning,&#34; he murmured, his voice low and warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne blinked, still stunned. &#34;Why are you here?&#34; she asked, confusion lacing her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t he spent the night with Rita?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s thoughts churned, unable to make sense of it-he didn&#39;t look as though he had just slipped back home at dawn. Could last night&#39;s photo have been nothing more than another one of Rita&#39;s calculated tricks?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian, oblivious to the suspicion flickering in her eyes, assumed she was still foggy from sleep. He drew her against his chest again, his lips brushing close to her ear as he murmured, &#34;What do you feel like having for breakfast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth of his breath skated across her skin like a spark of static, sending a shiver racing down her spine. Flustered, she stammered, &#34;A-anything&#39;s fine.&#34; With a small nod, Julian slid out of bed, and soon the steady hiss of running water drifted from the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne remained a little disoriented, almost certain she hadn&#39;t yet woken from a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had things between her and Julian shifted to this kind of ease? They looked every bit like a long-married couple, steady and affectionate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The irony wasn&#39;t lost on her-they had been separated, divorce proceedings already in motion, yet here they were, playing the role of a perfect pair for Rodger&#39;s benefit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, with Rodger not at the scene, Julian still kept up the act. Wasn&#39;t he taking his performance a bit too seriously?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dragged a hand over her face, pushing aside the jumble of thoughts clouding her mind, and swung her legs out of bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no time to indulge in confusion. After reassuring Rodger today, she still had to return to the office and endure the covert stares, the sharp gossip, and the constant scrutiny waiting for her there.</p>
