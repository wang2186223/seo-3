                <p>Across the living room, Rita lounged on the sofa, idly lifting her hand to admire the glossy finish of her newly painted nails, her lips curved in smug satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne made her way down the stairs with unhurried grace, dressed in soft, casual loungewear that still carried the air of elegance. Her expression was perfectly composed, the serene smile of a woman in command of her home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Adams, such an early visit,&#34; she remarked smoothly. &#34;What business brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita tilted her chin, and with Julian gone, the sugary facade evaporated. Her smile sharpened, her eyes flashing with malice as she delivered her words like a knife.&#34;I came to ask you to divorce Julian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s gaze cooled, a faint narrowing of her eyes betraying her irritation. A laugh almost escaped her-low,scornful, incredulous at the sheer gall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, divorce was her purpose as well, but for a mistress to march into her house and demand it? That was goddamn outrageous. Holding to that thought, Yvonne&#39;s chin lifted, her voice edged with frost. &#34;And if I don&#39;t agree? Ms Adams, stop deluding yourself and face the reality.Without my consent, a divorce will never happen. And as long as that stands, you&#39;ll always be nothing more than the pathetic other woman. And the other woman sure as hell doesn&#39;t get to talk to me that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s jaw tightened, but a sly smile soon curved across her lips. Her voice carried a dangerous calm.&#34;It&#39;s you who should face the reality. The unloved wife is the real outsider, wouldn&#39;t you agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s gaze hardened into ice, yet Rita didn&#39;t flinch.With a spark of defiance, Rita leaned in slightly, her words deliberate. &#34;In fact, there&#39;s another reason l came today... I know you&#39;re pregnant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit Yvonne like a lightning strike, and her hands curled into fists before she could stop herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s smirk deepened as she pressed the blade in further. &#34;I also know why you&#39;ve kept your pregnancy from Julian-because you understand he doesn&#39;t love you, and he&#39;d never want this child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The most guarded secret in Yvonne&#39;s heart was dragged out and trampled by the woman who had stolen her husband&#39;s devotion. Shame cut through her so sharply she felt ice spreading through her veins. She forced her spine straight, lifting her chin to hold on to the lastfragile thread of composure, determined not to crumble in front of Rita.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Rita&#39;s voice came again, merciless and taunting.&#34;On your third wedding anniversary, Julian was with me-that&#39;s the real reason he came home so late...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut your mouth!&#34; Yvonne&#39;s shout cracked with fury though her trembling voice betrayed her, and the wave of nausea in her stomach surged violently. She couldn&#39;t let another word reach her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Rita pressed on, her voice sharp with triumph,&#34;That night, he proposed to me. We spent the night together, and my child was conceived right then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She studied Yvonne&#39;s face with undisguised delight,savoring the moment as the usually composed woman trembled on the edge of collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s eyes burned red, her body quivering as she clenched her teeth, dignity splintering under the weight of humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nevertheless, she lifted her chin, forcing a brittle smile and carrying herself with the poise of the lady of the house. &#34;So what?&#34; she muttered evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unexpected response knocked Rita off balance for an instant. Yvonne&#39;s voice turned cool, almost scornful. &#34;You clearly don&#39;t understand how high society works. Men often keep mistresses, even father children outside their marriage. But illegitimate children are never acknowledged. Do you honestly think Rodger, with his reputation for fairness and uncompromising principles,would ever recognize your child as one of his own?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s face tightened, her composure cracking, while Yvonne released a slow breath, her lips curving into a subtle, derisive smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t fool yourself into thinking you could climb higher just because a man favors you. In this circle,affection never lasts. As long as I&#39;m Julian&#39;s wife,don&#39;t even dream of getting your ass into the Powell family,&#34; Yvonne sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with the satisfaction those words brought,no comfort followed. She bit back her tears with sheer determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Rita, her loss was undeniable, but surrendering in shame was more than she could endure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita&#39;s features contorted with anger, but her eyes flicked to the sapphire bracelet glinting on Yvonne&#39;s wrist. A sudden laugh slipped from her lips, laced with feigned regret. &#34;That bracelet is gorgeous. But l&#39;ve never cared for blue. Honestly, knowing that something | dislike ended up on you is almost  comforting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s gaze snapped to Rita, disbelief flashing across her face. &#34;What the hell are you getting at?!&#34;</p>
