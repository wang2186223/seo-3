                <p>Julian&#39;s palm pressed against Yvonne&#39;s forehead, the warmth of his hand at odds with the irritation in his tone. &#34;You&#39;re burning up. Do you have a fever?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could even form a reply, her body lifted off the ground. A startled gasp slipped from her lips as she instinctively clung to his neck to keep from falling. Her mind swam in a fog, and it took long moments before she pieced together what was happening</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder the wvorld had felt so heavy all day. She had chalked it up to stress, but now the truth was undeniable-she was feverish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without pause, Julian adjusted his hold and strode toward the hospital doors. &#34;You need a doctor. I&#39;m taking you for a check-up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hazy thoughts sharpened in an instant, panic rushing in. If she went through an examination, he might uncover the pregnancy she had worked so hard to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation fueled her resistance. She pushed against him, her voice rising. &#34;No! I don&#39;t need a check-up. I&#39;m fine.Put me down, Julian. I just want to go home!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s sigh came out heavy with impatience.&#34;Yvonne,stop being childish. Only kids throw tantrums about seeing a doctor when they&#39;re sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip didn&#39;t falter; her struggles were no match for his strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Illness made her defenses crumble, and in that vulnerable moment, frustration spilled over. Her eyes shimmered, her voice breaking. &#34;I don&#39;t want your help!We&#39;ve been married three years, and not once have you cared when I was sick. Don&#39;t start pretending now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tears stunned him, rooting him in place. For the first time, the sight of her hurt carved through his usual composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something shifted in his expression as he softened.&#34;Alright... if you don&#39;t want to see a doctor, then we won&#39;t. I&#39;ll take you home instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Yvonne like a heavy burden finally cast aside, and the fever&#39;s grip soon pulled her under.Her breathing steadied as she slipped into sleep,cradled in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian lingered, studying her face in silence, before shifting and carrying her toward the waiting car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered her carefully into the passenger seat,leaning close as he drew the seatbelt across her chest. Just as the buckle clicked, she stirred in her sleep, her lips brushing faintly against his cheek. Her voice,fragile and pleading, broke through the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julian... please, don&#39;t hurt our...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes froze on her face, his expression unreadable as the words lingered in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engine came alive, and the car rolled onto the open road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Yvonne had been awake, she would have noticed immediately that he wasn&#39;t driving toward his estate.Instead, he was heading straight for her own apartment-a place she had never once told him about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they arrived, Julian lifted her with surprising gentleness and carried her inside. The moment her back met the bed, Yvonne&#39;s lashes fluttered. As the familiar walls came into focus, she jolted fully awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows knit, voice edged with suspicion.&#34;How do you know where I live? And how did you get in? Have you been spying on me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s tone remained calm, unshaken. &#34;This apartment belongs to the Powell Group. I&#39;ve known about it sinte the day you moved in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set a glass of water on the nightstand, placing a tablet beside it. &#34;If you won&#39;t let a doctor check you,then at least take this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s hand instinctively moved to her stomach,her eyes flickering with unease. The reminder cut through her haze-pregnant women couldn&#39;t take medicine so casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne forced a smile, her voice light but strained.&#34;I&#39;m already feeling better. There&#39;s no need for medicine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s brows knitted as he stepped in, lifting his hand to check her temperature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, she slapped it away, only to hear his cold laugh. &#34;You&#39;re burning up, and you expect me to believe you&#39;re fine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw tightened, but no argument came. Instead, she turned her face aside stubbornly. &#34;I said I&#39;m not taking it,and I won&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence stretched between them. For once,Julian didn&#39;t press, and that alone startled her enough to glance back at him. Before she could speak, a sudden coolness spread across her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, she reached up, but his hand caught hers and held it firmby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move. It&#39;s just a cooling patch. If you refuse medicine, then this will have to do,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s eyes widened, disbelief flickering in them.Since when did Julian show patience, let alone compromise?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smoothed the patch into place, then lifted his gaze to hers. Slowly, he leaned closer, his breath brushing her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Won&#39;t see a doctor, won&#39;t take medicine,&#34; he murmured, his voice low and probing. &#34;Tell me,Yvonne-what exactly are you so afraid of?&#34;</p>
