                <p>The hospital entrance lay eerily quiet beneath the weight of midnight, the silence broken only by the unspoken tension between Julian and Yvonne as they faced one another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Yvonne dropped her gaze, unable to hold his eyes any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm raged inside her chest, sharp and relentless,begging for release. She could have screamed, could have wept like a woman shattered by love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that would strip her of the little dignity she had left, and it was for dignity&#39;s sake that she had chosen divorce in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in a slow breath, she curved her lips into a brittle smile. Her tone came out feather-light,though her heart bled beneath it. &#34;Because I don&#39;t love you anymore. I&#39;m exhausted,Julian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coldness in his face deepened,his jaw tightening until his teeth ground together. &#34;I want a real reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is. What&#39;s wrong? Do you really believe you&#39;re so irresistible that I&#39;m doomed to love you until the day I die? That I should cling to a marriage that feels like  nothing but emptiness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her defiance twisted something inside him, unearthing the shadow of Spencer in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she reached for someone else just to escape the emptiness?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury seared through Julian at the thought, burning away every trace of composure. A bitter laugh slipped from his throat. &#34;So be it. I&#39;ll give you what you want.In the end, this was always just business. Anyone can fill the role of my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words sliced into her, draining the color from her face,though the night mercifully hid it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How pathetic she must have seemed-fighting for freedom, only to find her heart splintering when he gave it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest felt hollow, like a barren wasteland where nothing living could survive, yet she forced herself to stand tall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a fragile smile, Yvonne answered softly, &#34;Alright then, Mr. Powell. Tell me when you&#39;d like to sign the papers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s stare bored into her, dark and unreadable, as though a storm churned behind his eyes. Then,just as quickly, the intensity vanished. He looked away with chilling calm. &#34;Two conditions. First, the divorce waits until my grandfather regains his health.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne tilted her head in agreement. Rodger&#39;s fragile state couldn&#39;t endure such a blow, and she had already intended to shield him from the truth until he recovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Second...&#34; Julian&#39;s gaze slid back to her, his voice deliberate and heavy. &#34;You sign with TR Entertainment and make five million within three months.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath caught, shock flashing across her face.&#34;Five million? In only three months? That&#39;s impossible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp laugh escaped him, dripping with disdain.&#34;Impossible? If you can&#39;t even manage that, what right do you have to walk away from the Powell family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her throat tightened, words failing her. The arrogance in his tone stung, yet part of her knew he wasn&#39;t exaggerating. In the Powell household, five million was less than her usual monthly allowance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the demand wasn&#39;t about money. Hewas setting the bar high on purpose, daring her to fail. Withouthis backing, where could she find such resources, such connections? &#34;If you can&#39;t deliver, then don&#39;t waste your time dreaming...&#34; His words drifted out casually, meant to dismiss her entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the spark that lit her fire. Straightening her spine, Yvonne cut him off, her voice steady and sharp.&#34;Fine. I&#39;ll do it. But remember this, Mr. Powell-if I succeed, you don&#39;t get to take your promise back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed, a cold smirk tugging at his lips.&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He missed the subtle tremor in her stance, the way her body seemed ready to give out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing a hand to her temple, Yvonne fought against a sudden wave of dizziness. Two days without proper sleep and meals, and the crushing weight of their confrontation had left her on the edge of collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined not to let Julian glimpse her weakness,Yvonne pivoted on her heel, intent on walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she moved, however, a piercing hum filled her head, her sight wavered, and her body lurched to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the ground could rise up to meet her, strong arms caught her mid-fall, pulling her against a chest that carried the steady, grounding scent of wood and earth.</p>
