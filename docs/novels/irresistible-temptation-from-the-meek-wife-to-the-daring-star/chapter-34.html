                <p>Inside the reading room, Yvonne sat hunched over the thick script, her focus unshakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The project was an adaptation of a once-popular novel, one with a rabid fan base that could turn on the production at the slightest misstep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The problem was clear: the novel, though beloved,had aged poorly. Twists that once captivated now felt illogical, even laughable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As director, it fell on Yvonne to reshape those flaws into something coherent,all while honoring the spirit of the original.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pondered on the end of her pen for a moment,then leaned in, scribbling notes into the margins,jotting down every flash of inspiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from her, Edwin poured coffee with exaggerated care, his grin stretched too wide, his words of praise flowing endlessly. His flattery was suffocating, but Yvonne understood-it wasn&#39;t about her. It was about Brock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That trust, misplaced or not, weighed on her shoulders She needed to prove she could deliver What Yvonne didn&#39;t notice was the figure lingering at the doorway-Brock&#39;s assistant, motioning Edwin out for a whispered exchange</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Edwin returned, the warmth in his smile had curdled into something sharp. He cleared his throat,his voice suddenly laced with condescension.&#34;Yvonne,there&#39;s no need for you to keep studying that script.Since you&#39;re new, I&#39;ve arranged other work for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne blinked, caught off guard by the sudden shift but she forced a smile as she stood. &#34;Alright. What would you like me to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked over her, and a smirk twisted his lips.&#34;You&#39;re still a newcomer, after all.Head down to the studio and handle the grunt work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body went rigid, disbelief clouding her face.&#34;Grunt work? In the studio?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze dropped to the script in her hands, and she forced another smile, though it trembled. &#34;There must be some mistake. This production is set to start casting in just a few days. Shouldn&#39;t I be preparing for that instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In all her years, she had never heard of a director being ordered to sweep floors and fetch coffee on set. The absurdity of it stunned her Edwin let out an exaggerated groan, his eyes rolling so far back it almost looked painful. &#34;You&#39;re out of the picture. Someone else will be directing from now on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s mouth fellopen as she tried to process his words.&#34;What happened? Why am I being replaced?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp glare, Edwin retorted, &#34;Why do you even care? Go do whatever grunt work they assign you at the studio, or just hand in your resignation if you can&#39;t handle it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grip tightened around the script, frustration burning beneath her calm exterior. She could take challenges in stride, but this situation was simply unfair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the urge to protest, Yvonne forced herself to stay collected. She was not about to make enemies on her very first day. After a pause, she nodded and replied, &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll head over now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The director&#39;s role was what she wanted from the start, and she knew she wouldn&#39;t be stuck doing meaningless tasks forever. Yvonne had confidence in her skills-if anyone gave her a real chance,she would prove herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed the script back on the table and pushed herself to her feet. As she reached the threshold,Edwin&#39;s voice, dripping with sarcasm, cut through the  air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Using connections to climb up,huh? Mr. Powell&#39;s wife is still in the picture. Did you honestly think you could snag him away and play the mistress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne stopped in her tracks, completely taken aback.&#34;What are you even implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, Edwin rolled his eyes again and stalked off, radiating disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone, Yvonne felt a storm of emotions swirling inside her. At that moment, she could no longer deny that the strange treatment she received was tied to Julian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the accusation made no sense to her. She had never tried to pursue Julian that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, two employees wandered by, their voices carrying into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you catch the headlines? Mrs. Powell is gorgeous -she and Mr. Powell actually look good together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just read that she used to model for some international label. Honestly, I wish I had her luck!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought Mr. Powell was the type to keep his private life locked away. Is he finally letting everyone know about his wife?&#34; Their chatter drifted away, leaving Yvonne standing in place, numb and shivering as a strange emptiness crept over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled out her phone and was instantly greeted by a flood of notifications. On a whim, she tapped one alert. There it was-a headline featuring a picture of Julian standing beside Rita.</p>
