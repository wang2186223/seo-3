                <p>Sunlight spilled through the hospital window,painting the stark room in pale gold. The brightness made Yvonne squint as her lashes fluttered open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, she tried to raise a hand to block the glare, but something stopped her. Her gaze dropped,and for a moment, her thoughts went blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slouched uncomfortably at the side of her bed was Julian, his tall frame folded awkwardly into the chair.One hand propped his head while the other wrapped firmly around hers, as though he hadn&#39;t let go all night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The steady warmth of his palm seeped into her skin,leaving her oddly dazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he really stayed by her side until morning?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Julian stirred. His browNs knit together, his eyelids twitching faintly as he began to wake. Yvonne&#39;s heart lurched. She snapped her eyes shut,feigning sleep, but it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice came low, touched with a faint smile.&#34;Morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lip trembled before she pulled her hand back sharply. Her words came out cold. &#34;Why are y/ou still here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian didn&#39;t answer right away. Instead, he leaned closer, the back of his hand brushing lightly against her forehead. His voice was husky, laced with sleep.&#34;How do you feel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unexpected gentleness caught her off guard.For a fleeting second,her heart softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the kind of care she had yearned for throughout their three years together, care he had never once shown her. Though she had sworn to leave him behind, she couldn&#39;t help but drink it in for just a moment. But the memory of last night came rushing back, slicing through the warmth. Her chest tightened, and with sudden resolve, she pushed his hand aside. &#34;I don&#39;t need your pity,&#34; she said coldly. &#34;Keep your false concern to yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s hand dropped. He lowered his gaze, and a shadow flickered through his eyes, something torn between regret and restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her rejection stung, but he couldn&#39;t deny he had earned it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long silence, he spoke again, his tone softer.&#34;The one who pushed you into the pool has already been found. She has paid the price for what she did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne lifted her chin, her gaze locking firmly onto Julian&#39;s. &#34;Are you really going to tell me it wasn&#39;t Rita?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s mouth tightened into a thin, hard line. &#34;She didn&#39;t push you herself. But she was the one who orchestrated it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blunt confession knocked the breath from her chest. Every word she had rehearsed crumbled on her tongue. A hollow laugh escaped instead. &#34;And what does her punishment look like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s brows pulled together, his voice dropping low. &#34;She&#39;s carrying a child. But I give you my word-she&#39;ll never cross your path again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s eyes widened before narrowing, disbelief flooding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was it? That was the so-called punishment? To sweep Rita out of sight so she could scheme in the shadows instead? Was he really asking her to believe this counted as justice?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worse still, Rita wasn&#39;t the only one expecting a child. Did he even realize their own baby had nearly been lost at Rita&#39;s hands the day before?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every part of her screamed to throw the truth in his face, but the words lodged in her throat. She forced in a breath, willed her temper to steady, and spoke coldly.&#34;Get lost.&#34; Her emotions, already frayed from the pregnancy and the terror of nearly drowning, could no longer withstand his hollow promises. His presence only scraped against her raw nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How foolish she felt, remembering that for one brief moment she had been softened by his false tenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t let your anger make decisions for you,&#34; Julian replied quietly, almost as though he were pleading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The calmness in his tone only poured fuel on her rage, making her want to scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I&#39;m angry! And if you can&#39;t stomach it,then give me the divorce I&#39;ve been asking for!&#34;Yvonne&#39;s sneer cut like a blade. Her eyes burned into Julian, her whole presence bristling like a wall of thorns.Every word out of his mouth only dug deeper into her fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian drew in a long breath, preparing to respond,but the sharp creak of wheels at the doorway silenced him. Both of them turned at once. Rodger entered,pushed forward by Paula, a trail of suited bodyguards following close behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face was dark, his gaze slicing through the tension thick in the room. &#34;What&#39;s going on here?Were you two fighting?&#34;</p>
