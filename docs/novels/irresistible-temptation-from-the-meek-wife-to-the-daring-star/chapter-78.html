                <p>Standing outside the film site, Yvonne turned to Trevor with a faint, grateful smile. &#34;I appreciate you stepping in, but please hold back next time. It&#39;ll only damage your reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone on set already branded her the other woman, her name smeared beyond repair. If Trevor spoke up for her, he&#39;d be crushed under the fallout with her. This was the reason Yvonne had held him back from telling the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how many explanations she gave, the verdict was already written-she was the other woman. To their eyes, Trevor was nothing more than her friend, and his defense would be brushed aside just the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor gave a casual shrug, his expression as unbothered as ever. &#34;I couldn&#39;t care less what people think.I&#39;m not planning to stick around here anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Yvonne&#39;s voice wavered, trying to keep up with what he had just said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor shoved his hands deeper into his pockets, tilting his head back so the sunlight spilled across his face as he squinted with lazy ease. &#34;I&#39;ve decided-I will no longer work with Rocco.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words dropped as lightly as if he were commenting on the weather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s jaw slackened in shock, and for a moment she had no words. When she finally looked down, guilt tugged at her voice. &#34;I&#39;m truly sorry. You wouldn&#39;t have lost your job if it weren&#39;t for me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor groaned dramatically, rolling his eyes, &#34;Lost my job? Listen carefully.I kicked Rocco out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tossed his head with a sharp laugh. &#34;His so-called artistic vision is a nightmare. Everything he directs turns into trash, and being forced to film that junk day after day was driving me insane, you get me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Yvonne&#39;s guilt lingered in her eyes, Trevor dragged a hand through his hair and added more sincerely,&#34;I&#39;ve been itching to quit for a long time. My team already clashed with him on a past project. This director switch got dumped on me last minute, and the contract locked me in. But I can&#39;t stand it anymore. This isn&#39;t on you-none of it.&#34; Yvonne&#39;s voice wavered as she pressed.&#34;What about the penalty for breaking the contract?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lashes trembled as she dared a glance at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her perspective, the photography team put in the most effort for the smallest gains, scraping by on modest paychecks.Trevor had never struck her as wealthy. If he walked out now, the penalty would be crushing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost unconsciously, she began calculating how much she could contribute, already weighing how far her savings could stretch to help cover the cost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Trevor only shrugged, unfazed. &#34;That penalty&#39;s nothing to me. Worst comes to worst, l&#39;ll just head back and run the family business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows shot up. &#34;Family business?&#34; she echoed,startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dipped his chin in an easy nod, then let out a low laugh. &#34;You didn&#39;t actually think I was broke, did you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne had, in fact, always assumed he came from. a modest background. His scuffed jeans and constantly half-lidded eyes radiated a lazy,carefree energy that fit the picture of a struggling artist she had painted in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her stunned expression, Trevor broke into loud laughter, doubling over as though the whole thing was a joke at her expense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening with a wide grin,he announced,&#34;My family owns a pretty profitable mining business. Not quite on the scale of the Powell Group, but I&#39;ve never had to worry about money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted in a small, disbelieving&#34;oh,&#34; which only seemed to fuel his delight. &#34;We even have a jewelry venture with the Powells. I&#39;ll pick out a massive diamond for you one day,&#34; he teased, eyes sparkling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then how did you end up in photography?&#34; Yvonne blurted,still baffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, mines and cameras belonged in entirely different worlds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping his gaze, Trevor replied in a languid drawl, &#34;It&#39;s my passion. I&#39;ve loved it since I was a kid. My parents hated it, thought I was throwing my life away, and tried to drag me back into the family business.I couldn&#39;t stand it, so I ran off to chase the life I wanted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression soured, brows knitting as he added with disdain, &#34;Didn&#39;t think mny first gig would be with someone as brainless as Rocco. Working with him has been a nightmare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s lips curved into a softer smile, the heaviness in her chest easing.&#34;So what&#39;s next for you? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re really going back to run the family business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not a chance.&#34; Trevor tipped his head back, shielding his eyes with a hand while grinning toward the horizon. &#34;My team and I are heading out to Uglana. We&#39;ll be filming the great animal migration. Far more exciting than putting up with some idiot director who doesn&#39;t know shit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her laughter slipped out, warm and genuine. &#34;Then I.hope the wilderness treats you well. Good luck out there.&#34;</p>
