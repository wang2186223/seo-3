                <p>Yvonne dragged herself through the front door, her steps heavy as if every ounce of strength had been drained from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kicking off her shoes, she stood still for a moment,her eyes roaming the dark, empty house. The corners of her lips curved into a hollow smile, one that carried no warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only now did she truly see how foolish she had been.This house had always been lifeless, just like Julian&#39;s heart. She had spent years guarding a place that was actually cold, silent, and meaningless,becoming little more than an object of pity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t surprise her that he wasn&#39;t home. He had spent the day at Rita&#39;s side, celebrating her pregnancy Most likely, he was still with her now, wrapped in tender moments that belonged only to them,imagining the family they would build together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every day before today, Yvonne would have already cooked a full dinner, set the table, and left the lights on,waiting for him with foolish hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But tonight, she didn&#39;t bother. She didn&#39;t even turn on the lights as she walked barefoot into the hollow living room, her body moving on autopilot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she reached the sofa, an unexpected hand shot out of the shadows, pulling her against a firm chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her startled cry filled the room just as a lamp flickered on, bathing Julian&#39;s face in soft, golden light. His features looked carved from stone, flawless and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing a finger to her lips, he whispered, &#34;It&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She froze, stunned by the sudden closeness. No matter how many times she told herself to stop caring,her heart still betrayed her, fluttering at the sight of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian let her go as quickly as he had pulled her in. The fleeting warmth vanished, leaving behind the same indifference as his voice turned cold, almost reproachful. &#34;Where have you been all day? I tried calling you over and over, but you never answered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reality slammed back into her chest. The question was almost laughable. Shouldn&#39;t it be her demanding to know where he had spent his day?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to scream the truth at him, but the words never left her mouth. Instead, she curved her lips into a faint, steady smile and replied, &#34;Yeah.&#34; Yeah? What was that supposed to mean? He was about to press further, but then he caught her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in her calm indifference made his irritation vanish. His words came out gentler, uncertain.&#39;you all right? You look pale... are you sick?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne dropped her gaze to the floor, realizing that the concern she once craved from him no longer carried the same weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhaustion pressed down on her, leaving no room to play the forgiving wife. Her voice was faint, almost detached. &#34;I&#39;m worn out. I need to rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned toward the stairs, but before she could take more than two steps, Julian&#39;s arm wrapped around her and pulled her back sharply against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body jolted from the force, and instinctively her hands flew to shield her stomach. Anger flared hot in her chest.&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34; she snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s eyes bore into her, his brow furrowing. &#34;You&#39;re pregnant, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath caught.He knew? But how?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wild question flickered through her mind-if he had discovered her pregnancy, then would he choose her or would he still cling to Rita? &#34;I...&#34; The admission trembled on her lips, but the sudden shrill ring of his phone sliced through the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian picked up his phone and answered the call.A soft, tearful voice came through the receiver,trembling with pain. &#34;Jules, I slipped in the bathroom,and my stomach hurts so badly. Can you come over?The baby...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s face hardened instantly, urgency sharpening his tone. &#34;Don&#39;t move. I&#39;m on my way right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended, and without hesitation he shoved Yvonne aside, striding toward the door with long,determined steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her vision blurred as tears welled, the sting cutting deep. One plea from Rita, and he could abandon her without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bitterness unlike anything she had felt before clawed up her throat. For once, she wanted to force the truth out of him, to know where his loyalty lay-was it ever with her, or had it always been with Rita?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed forward, fingers clutching his sleeve desperately. Her lips parted, but before she could beg him to stay, his voice snapped like a whip. &#34;Whatever it is, save it until I get back!&#34; Her restraint shattered. Her voice shook violently as she cried out, &#34;Where are you going? Who was that woman? You&#39;re my husband, Julian. How can you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words she wanted to hurl at him caught in her throat. In that instant, it struck her-maybe she had been wrong all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two months of routine dinners and fleeting gestures had tricked her into believing in something that was never real. She had let herself dream of a marriage that only existed in her imagination, forgetting that Julian had never once offered his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their marriage had always been a transaction,nothing more than a carefully staged illusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s hand moved with a cold precision as he pried her fingers away from his sleeve. His eyes, sharp and merciless,pinned her down like a blade. &#34;Yvonne, stop deceiving yourself. I told you from the start-I don&#39;t love you. Whatever I do is none of your concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart hollowed at the cruelty in his tone. Her chest tightened painfully at his bluntness. She loosened her hold, a broken sob slipping past her lips as she whispered, &#34;I&#39;m sorry... I went too far...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian lingered only long enough to cast her a silent,cutting look. Without another word, he turned and walked out, the door slamming behind him with finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The echo of that sound told her everything-whatever fragile tie had existed between them had just snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s chilling stare refused to leave her thoughts,replaying like a cruel reminder she couldn&#39;t escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach twisted, and she stumbled toward the bathroom, hand pressed over her mouth until she collapsed in front of the toilet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing but water spilled out-she had eaten almost nothing all day, yet her body convulsed as though punishing her further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The spasms wracked her frame, and tears blurred her vision. With trembling fingers, she rested her palm against her flat belly, a broken laugh escaping through the pain. &#34;Little one, you couldn&#39;t have chosen a worse moment to arrive. I&#39;m the only person in this world who wants you.&#34;</p>
