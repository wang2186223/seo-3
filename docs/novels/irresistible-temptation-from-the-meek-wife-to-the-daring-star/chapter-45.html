                <p>The cameras rolled again for a scene that would mark a turning point in the story. Rita, despite her reluctance, was pushed into it after the scriptwriter and director explained every angle in detail,leaving her no room to back out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The setup was simple but intimate-the heroine would stumble into the pool, and the hero would dive in after her. Beneath the shimmering water, a kiss would seal the bond between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Rita checked her reflection in the mirror and fixed her makeup, Yvonne had been sent to help the props team, busy verifying that every piece of equipment around the pool was safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Engrossed in the work, she didn&#39;t notice the tall figure stepping quietly into the set&#39;s entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian, fresh from a nearby meeting, suddenly remembered that Yvonne was working here. On a whim, he decided to stop by without giving anyone an advance notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes swept the crew as he entered, and when he failed to spot Yvonne, a faint crease formed between his brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Rita who noticed him first. &#34;Julian!&#34; she called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abandoning her makeup chair, she rushed over,slipping her arm around his with a girlish smile. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me you were coming? I would&#39;ve been ready to welcome you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commotion drew Rocco from behind the monitors. His eyes lit up at the sight, and he hurried forward. &#34;Mr. Powell, what an honor! As expected,you&#39;re every bit as distinguished and accomplished in person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s tone cut through the air like frost. &#34;And who exactly are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock,standing a step behind, chimed in quickly with a strained smile, &#34;Mr. Powell, thisis Rocco Duncan-the director of our film.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s expression grew even colder. &#34;Strange.I was told Yvonne was directing this project.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words left Rocco and Brock stunned. They exchanged uneasy glances, unable to believe that even with Rita, Julian&#39;s wife in every rumor, clinging to him, Julian openly acknowledged Yvonne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought gnawed at them both. Did this man truly care nothing for how his reputation looked in front of the entire industry?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Against the weight of money and influence, no one dared to push back. Brock forced a stiff smile and explained, &#34;Ms. Ellis believed she wasn&#39;t experienced enough to helm such a large project just yet, so she chose to step back as assistant and let Mr. Duncan direct.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian considered the words carefully. It did sound like something Yvonne would do-humble, willing to bear the brunt quietly. His eyes softened, and he was about to ask after her when Rita, sensing his attention slip away, squeezed his arm tighter and said sweetly, &#34;Julian, I&#39;m about to start filming. Stay and watch me, won&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side of the set, Yvonne was still occupied with the prop crew when a voice nearby exclaimed, &#34;Look, Mr. Powell came to see Rita!They&#39;re such a perfect match!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words made her pause. She raised her head and immediately caught sight of the pair drawing everyone&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian, effortlessly striking, stood with Rita hanging onto his arm, bright and lively beside him. He didn&#39;t push her away-instead, he leaned closer, saying something that made her beam. They looked every bit the enviable couple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill spread through Yvonne&#39;s chest, heavy and suffocating, as if she&#39;d just fallen into the cold po01herself. The ache gnawed at her heart. How could the man who had held her so brazenly the night before now stand so openly affectionate with another woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her certainty wavered. Was Rita telling the truth all along? Which Julian was the real one-the tender man in the dark or the indifferent figure on display?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like she was trapped inside a maze where every turn betrayed her, where lies and half-truths blurred together until she couldn&#39;t tell who to believe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s gaze swept across the crowd, as though he were searching for someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic gripped Yvonne. She tried to rise discreetly,but her legs were stiff from crouching too long. A wave of dizziness struck, and she stumbled.Before she could steady herself, a shove came from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next instant, water exploded from the pool in a deafening splash.</p>
