                <p>Pulling up to the villa, the car rolled to a gentle stop.Yvonne sat rigid, her gaze locked on the scenery outside, lips pressed together in a silent protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile tugged at his lips as Julian asked, &#34;Are you still angry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head turned slowly, her eyes searching his. &#34;Isn&#39;t there any room for us to negotiate about the budget?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a beat, he hesitated, then shifted his gaze aside with cool indifference, a gesture that only deepened her unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s tone grew urgent as she continued, &#34;Just think of it as a temporary loan. I promise,the moment this film turns a profit, you&#39;ll get every cent back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had crunched numbers, trimming costs wherever she could, yet even then, filming with just two hundred thousand was a dream too thin to hold.Still,she refused to let the dream go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope flickered in Yvonne&#39;s eyes as she looked at Julian. She had never once asked him for anything.But this time, she wanted his support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Julian&#39;s face gave nothing away.Eventually, he quietly undid his seatbelt, got out, and opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me get dinner started. You and Grandpa can relax for a bit,&#34; he said, without glancing back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart sank, her body stiffening as she watched him walk away. Her teeth caught her lower lip,and disappointment filled her eyes until they shone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dinner that evening carried the weight of unspoken tensioh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne could hardly bring herself to smile at Rodger.After forcing down a few bites, she laid her fork aside and rose to her feet. &#34;I&#39;m done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, she hurried upstairs. Another glance at Julian&#39;s face, and she feared she would burst, letting her anger spill in front of Rodger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian didn&#39;t bat an eye,taking his time with his meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger, on the other hand, looked ready to burst. HHis eyes darted between the stairs and Julian, mustache bristling, cane poised with indignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You idiot! I gave you the perfect chance, and you still managed to drive her off again?&#34; he snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the cane never struck, it hovered threateningly, as though the next words out of Julian&#39;s mouth would decide if it came down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian pressed his fingers against his forehead with a weary sigh, then gently guided the cane back to its place by the wheelchair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa, please trust me. Everything I&#39;m doing is to keep Yvonne close,&#34; said Julian, his tone steady and sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Rodger&#39;s brows furrowed with doubt. &#34;Really,&#34; Julian replied, his eyes calm and unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually Rodger let out a heavy sigh, shaking his head. &#34;Alright, I won&#39;t meddle in your business. But hear me, boy-if Yvonne ever walks away because you let her down, I&#39;ll be the one to make you pay!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back upstairs, Yvonne slipped into her room,quietly closed the door, and hurried over to her vanity. She pulled open a drawer and grabbed a small box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perching on the bed, she tipped the box over and watched a handful of bank cards and some jewelry scatter across the covers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving up was out of the question. Even if it meant dipping into her own savings, she would see the film finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being Julian&#39;s wife meant money was rarely an issue.In the last three years, she&#39;d hardly stepped out or splurged, so Yvonne felt sure she&#39;d built up a healthy sum. That confidence faded fast as she checked card after card, her stomach tightening with every low balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her shock, all her liquid funds barely added up to a few tens of thousands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did the truth strike her-she had always been spending through Julian&#39;s supplementary card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Living cushioned as a wealthy wife, she had never thought of saving, and so her funds were nearly nonexistent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret pressed down hard, the weight of financial dependence suddenly unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The little cash she had couldn&#39;t carry the project, and her modest jewelry collection, never being one for extravagance, would barely make a dent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s refusal to support her left her at a dead end.Where else could she possibly find the money?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes fell on the supplementary card shoved into the corner of the box, and an idea sparked. Ever since asking Julian for a divorce, she hadn&#39;t touched the money in that account. Maybe he&#39;d forgotten all about it.</p>
