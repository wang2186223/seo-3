                <p>Yvonne&#39;s face still carried that faint, bewildered look.Under that gaze, Spencer felt like a pathetic liar,weaving justifications to serve his own desires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shame prickled in his chest, but at this moment,he convinced himself it was the only path forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat and said carefully, &#34;Julian isn&#39;t refusing divorce because he loves you. He&#39;s acting out of fear. It&#39;s a man&#39;s possessiveness-he might not want you, but he sure as hell doesn&#39;t want anyone else to take you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her teeth pressed into her lower lip, and though she wanted to reject his reasoning outright, she couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer&#39;s words hit uncomfortably close to the truth.Julian had only changed after witnessing her draw closer to Spencer. Softening his tone, Spencer leaned in slightly nervous hope flickering in his eyes. &#34;If you want proof, there&#39;s one clear way to test it. You and I... we could confirm it by being together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s eyes flew wide, and she cut him off before he could even finish. &#34;That can&#39;t possibly happen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp sting of regret pierced Spencer as he realized he&#39;d rushed too far. He forced a casual shrug, masking the ache in his chest with a wry smile. &#34;Just tossing the idea out there. If it makes you uncomfortable, forget | said anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her gaze, teeth pressing into her lip.She wasn&#39;t naive-she could tell whether his words had been lighthearted or spoken with sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in her heart, Spencer had never been more than a cherished friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian already filled every corner of her soul, leaving no space for anyone else. She couldn&#39;t allow Spencer to foster false hope, nor could she afford to string him along. Her tongue lingered on the edge of honesty, but Spencer seemed to sense the unspoken rejection.Before she could say a word, he hurried on with a gentler tone. &#34;The day after tomorrow marks your parents&#39; death anniversary. I ordered flowers. Let me go with you, alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chance to respond slipped away as the emergency room door banged open. Julian appeared in the doorway, his expression carved from ice. HHis voice cut through the air like a blade. &#34;Dr. Briggs,your company won&#39;t be necessary. I&#39;ll take my wife myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian grew tense when Spencer didn&#39;t emerge after the surgery light turned green and the nurses had already left. Unease coiled in his chest, and though he hadn&#39;t intended to linger, his steps slowed near the door. Through the crack, he caught Spencer&#39;s voice-calm,coaxing Yvonne to divorce him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for Yvonne&#39;s sake, Julian would have stormed in and made Spencer regret every word. Spencer, however, didn&#39;t rise to the unspoken challenge.His eyes narrowed briefly before he forced a wry smile, turning back to Yvonne. His voice dropped to something almost tender. &#34;Yvonne, I meant no harm. Your parents were always good to me, and before they passed, they asked me to look out for you. I only wanted to honor their memory by going with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s lashes trembled, her eyes glistening as she gave a faint nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Spencer faced Julian, his composure sharpening into something more defiant. &#34;Mr. Powell,Yvonne means a great deal to me. I can&#39;t stand to see her endure this kind of misery. These last three years have been hell for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone hardened, every word deliberate. &#34;During your marriage, I doubt you&#39;ve gone with her even once to pay respects to her parents. Why interfere now,of all times?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s fists tightened, his knuckles paling as his eyes narrowed with simmering restraint. He finally understood that Spencer wasn&#39;t just meddling-Spencer had deliberately struck at his weakest point,cloaking it as concern for Yvonne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two men locked gazes, neither raising a hand,yet the tension between them crackled like static in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian let out a frigid sneer, his voice edged with menace. &#34;You&#39;re nothing but an outsider-so keep your concern to yourself. Starting now, I will be by her side for every visit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clash of words made Yvonne&#39;s chest sink with weariness. She longed to break their standoff, but a sudden throbbing pain pierced her skull. With a muffled groan, she pressed her hand to her temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian noticed instantly, the hard lines of his face shifting as he abandoned Spencer and hurried toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer rushed forward too, both men reaching for her at once, their hands hovering protectively as identical words tumbled from their mouths. &#34;Are you all right?&#34;</p>
