                <p>Yvonne&#39;s every move had Rita practically buzzing with anticipation. She wished more than anything to force that pill into Yvonne&#39;s mouth herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Yvonne lost the baby, she&#39;d no longer be a problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right before the pill reached Yvonne&#39;s lips, a hand shot out and seized her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne jumped, glancing over to find Julian standing there,his face unreadable. He gave her wrist a steady shake until the pill tumbled from her grasp and hit the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Rita, Julian said without much emotion, &#34;I&#39;LL take her to the hospital and get things checked out.She shouldn&#39;t take any medicine until we know exactly what&#39;s happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance flashed across Rita&#39;s features, though she managed to plaster on a gentle smile. &#34;Of course,you&#39;re right. It&#39;s safer that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Yvonne traced her wrist where Julian had touched her, warmth still lingering, her feelings twisted up inside. Maybe he was worried about her. The idea barely had time to settle before she brushed it away, a bitter little smile on her lips. Why let herself get fooled again?Most likely, Julian just wanted to put on a show for Rodger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a shake of her head, she forced herself to let it go, not realizing that Julian&#39;s gaze lingered on her for a long moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to lighten the mood, Sharon suggested they all sit down for lunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharing a table with Rita left Yvonne with no appetite.An uncomfortable heaviness settled over the meal,making the atmosphere feel stifling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she could, Yvonne rose from her seat,snatched up her bag, and turned to Rodger to say goodbye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger raised his gaze, his tone full of concern as he glanced at Julian, who was still deep in conversation with Rita. &#34;Are you planning to visit the hospital by yourself? Wasn&#39;t Julian supposed to go with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swallowing her annoyance, Yvonne decided not to call Julían out. She offered a patient reply.&#34;Of course Julian&#39;s coming with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then called over to him, making sure her words carried. &#34;Honey, it&#39;s time to head to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her call him &#34;honey,&#34; Julian grew noticeably tense.Even knowing she was only acting, he still felt his heart skip a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked away from Rita and approached Yvonne,picking up her bag as if it were the most natural thing in the world. &#34;Come on, let&#39;s get going,&#34; he said,his tone gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they bid farewell to the Powell family and walked toward the door, they appeared the picture of a devoted couple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strolling through the garden, they heard hurried footsteps behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita caught up, her face drained of color as she quietly pleaded with Julian, &#34;Julian, I don&#39;t feel well. Can you drop me home first? I really don&#39;t want to go to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s eyes shifted to Yvonne, clearly torn. After a moment, he spoke up. &#34;I&#39;ll have the driver take you to the hospital, Yvonne. I need to get Rita home first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne had expected this, but it still stung. She forced a casual smile. &#34;Go on.It&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no more time, Julian turned to walk away with Rita. Left standing by herself, Yvonne fought back tears.She blinked fast, but the tears spilled over anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to stay positive, she reminded herself that at least there would be no need to come up with lies about her pregnancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing some solitude, she set off for home on foot,hoping the walk would help her settle down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she was leaving the neighborhood, her phone vibrated. An unknown number had sent her a video,the preview showing Julian&#39;s familiar profile behind the wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused,she opened the message and tapped on the video. The clip began with Julian driving, while Rita&#39;s voice floated in from the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julian, what if Yvonne really is pregnant? Would you take responsibility for the child?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That question made Yvonne freeze. She paused the video, her heart beating fast. Her finger hovered over the screen, torn between curiosity and dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Julian truly want her to have the baby? She found herself needing to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a steadying breath, she hit play once more.</p>
