                <p>The sudden appearance of Rodger and Jordy shattered the intense disagreement that had settled between Julian and Yvonne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s expression shifted in an instant, his lips curving into a warm smile as he slipped an arm around Yvonne&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa,&#34; he said smoothly, voice laced with forced calm, &#34;Yvonne&#39;s upset because she thinks the gift l chose isn&#39;t impressive enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the words flowed easily from his mouth, his eyes flicked toward her with a sharp, unspoken warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne almost laughed at the sheer artistry of his performance. Compared to him,she felt like a clumsy novice, managing only a stiff smile and a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s booming laughter filled the air, his gaze twinkling with teasing warmth as it landed on her.&#34;What more could I ask for than seeing the two of you so harmonious? But if you really want to give me the best gift, then bring me a strong great-grandchild soon.&#34; Without meaning to, Yvonne&#39;s hand drifted to her stomach, her eyes lowering as a shadow of sorrow crossed her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She carried that very child inside her, yet deep down she doubted Julian wanted it to exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the shift in her expression, Julian quickly interjected, eager to steer the moment away. &#34;Let&#39;s not linger here. Everyone must be waiting inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group moved into the lavishly adorned living room,where the younger generation of the Powell family had already gathered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they entered, Nadine Powell, Julian&#39;s aunt, glided forward with a warm smile, slipping her hand into Yvonne&#39;s and looking her over with concern. &#34;How are you holding up, dear? You look thinner than before.Has Julian been considerate enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian, standing just behind, looped an arm around Yvonne&#39;s waist and replied with mock indignation,&#34;Aunt Nadine,how could I ever fail to take care of her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Yvonne recognized it for the empty act it was,her chest gave a faint flutter. She tilted her head upward just as he looked down, and for the briefest second, something softer seemed to linger in his eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, a gentle voice drifted in fromn the doorway. &#34;Julian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every head in the room turned, revealing Rita standing meekly just behind Sharon Powell, Julian&#39;s mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere thickened at once, the cheerful chatter collapsing into uneasy silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s expression hardened, his eyes narrowing on Sharon.His voice thundered across the room. &#34;This is a family gathering. Why would you bring an outsider here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Sharon&#39;s cheeks flushed with embarrassment. &#34;I only ran into Rita during a yoga class. She said she wanted to offer you birthday wishes...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger cut her off with a sharp glare. &#34;I don&#39;t need empty greetings from a shallow woman like her,who only chases after wealth. Have you all forgotten the disgrace she caused us back then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one dared answer. The Powells exchanged silent,knowing looks. Yvonne alone stayed bewildered,her thoughts racíng.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What disgrace? What had happened back then?Wasn&#39;t it Rodger who had pushed Julian into marrying her in the first place?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon&#39;s eyes flicked briefly toward Yvonne but  quickly turned away. Her tone softened as she said,&#34;There was a misunderstanding before. And Rita didn&#39;t just come to offer her wishes. She&#39;s a close friend of Dr. Jarrod Carter, the renowned heart surgeon. His team has been working on a new specialty medicine that could ease your chronic heart ailment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Nadine&#39;s and Jordy&#39;s faces changed in an instant. Their cool disdain melted into eager anticipation as their gazes fixed on Rita. Even Julian&#39;s guarded expression faltered, surprise flashing across his eyes as he looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s failing heart had long weighed over the family, a shadow no physician had managed to lift.Age only worsened the condition, stealing his strength and leaving the Powells anxious with every passing year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For them, the promise of a new specialty medicine was more precious than gold. If it truly existed, they would pay any price to secure it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, the family crowded around Rita, hope flickering in their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian stepped forward, his voice urgent. &#34;Rita, how do you know Dr. Carter? Can this specialty medicine really work for my grandpa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Encircled by the crowd, Rita gave a timid smile and answered in a gentle voice, which only deepened Yvonne&#39;s sense of being alone and set apart from everyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her teeth pressed into her lip as she watched. To Yvonne, it felt like Rita was the one who truly belonged, while her own place in the Powell family existed only because she carried the title of Julian&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea haunted her. If they ever discovered Rita was carrying Julian&#39;s child, she was certain the family would welcome Rita far more than her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger,however, wasn&#39;t swayed by talk of medicine or promises of cures. Instead, his expression darkened,and he struck the armrest of his wheelchair with a sharp smack to silence the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fixing Rita with a stern glare, Rodger asked, &#34;Tell me,what is your real reason for coming back this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita flinched at his words, clutching at Julian&#39;s sleeve as tears brimmed in her eyes. &#34;Rodger, I only wanted to see Julian again. I don&#39;t have any other motives...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julían placed a hand on her shoulder, his voice gentling as he leaned in to comfort her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight made Yvonne&#39;s stomach twist. She clamped a hand over her mouth and stumbled out of the room,rushing to the bathroom to vomit. The Powell family was caught off guard, and Nadine leaned in to whisper softly, &#34;Yvonne&#39;s condition looks like the early signs of pregnancy, like morning sickness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s eyes narrowed at once, his expression unreadable as a storm of thoughts crossed his mind.</p>
