                <p>Yvonne froze for a heartbeat before giving her head a small shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The film was supposed to be a massive production backed by an investment in the hundreds of millions -Brock&#39;s prized project. How could the funding have simply vanished overnight?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A possible explanation stirred in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor didn&#39;t make her wait. His voice dripped with gloating satisfaction as he announced, &#34;Julian pulled the investment. Now the company&#39;s in total disarray.Brock&#39;s scrambling like a headless chicken, begging anyone who&#39;ll listen for help. Shame you didn&#39;t see the panic on his face-it was priceless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news didn&#39;t shock her in the least. Under circumstances like these, Julian would hardly risk letting Rita step into the spotlight again. That movie had been built around her, and without its leading actress, there was no reason for him to keep pouring money into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor leaned forward, his eyes glinting with amusement. &#34;Want to know why Julian cut the funding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne,uninterested, nearly blurted out Rita&#39;s name when Trevor lowered his voice and continued, &#34;It&#39;s because of you. At the shareholders&#39; meeting,Julian tore into Brock, demanding why you weren&#39;t kept on as the director as originally promised, and why someone else had been shoved into the role instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath cauight in her throat. That couldn&#39;t be true. Why would Julian defend her so openly? He&#39;d always been careful to keep their relationship hidden from outsiders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor&#39;s expression shifted, his eyes narrowing with scrutiny. His tone lost its teasing edge. &#34;Yvonne,what exactly is going on between you and Julian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, like everyone else,he had assumed she was nothing more than Julian&#39;s mistress. But after spending time with her, he no longer believed she was that kind of woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, with everything that had happened, his doubts had hardened into certainty. A man of Julian&#39;s stature would never go to such lengths for a mere mistress-would he?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne lowered her gaze, staying silent for what felt like an eternity before she finally looked up at Trevor and spoke softly. &#34;If I told you I was his wife... would you believe me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor&#39;s eyes went wide, shock flashing across his face. He needed several moments to process it before blurting out indignantly, &#34;Then why do you let Rita parade around like she owns the place? How can you stomach her arrogance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter smile tugged at Yvonne&#39;s lips, yet no words followed. How in the world could she put into words that Rita mattered more than she did to Julian?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reading the pain in her silence, Trevor wisely dropped the subject. After a pause, his tone grew grave. &#34;I believe you. But not everyone will. You should brace yourself. The rumors running through the company lately... they&#39;ve been vicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression sobered instantly. She understood all too well. Once she returned to work, countless questioning eyes would be waiting. Until she and Julian openly acknowledged their marriage, the gossip would never die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne let out a steady breath and gave a small nod.&#34;Got it. I appreciate the reminder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, dwelling on rumors seemed pointless now. She had already braced herself to confront whatever storm awaited at the company. What truly weighed on her was the thought of returning to the Powell estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How on earth could she possibly keep her pregnancy hidden from the entire Powell family while still ensuring the baby was properly cared for? That challenge felt far more daunting than surviving a storm in the middle of the ocean. A few soft words of comfort slipped from Trevor&#39;s lips before the call faded to silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, Yvonne forced herself into calm. She ordered another meal and followed the doctor&#39;s regimen to the letter-eating on time, resting when told, the picture of a perfect patient that medical staff admired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When dawn broke, she didn&#39;t wait for Julian to arrive and went ahead to process her discharge on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hospital entrance, Spencer walked her out. His usual composure was there, but he seemed oddly drained. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, hinting at a sleepless night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, his voice stayed gentle as he offered a faint smile. &#34;Yvonne, you need to take care of yourself.Don&#39;t forget your prenatal vitamins, all right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sincerity in his words gave her pause. Why did it sound as though he were bidding her farewell? She studied his weary eyes with concern. &#34;Spencer,what&#39;s going on with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a beat, he hesitated, then curved his lips into a wry smile. &#34;I&#39;m leaving the country.&#34;</p>
