                <p>Julian lingered with Yvonne a little longer, letting her voice fill the quiet air while he mostly listened, at rare moments showing his astonishment with a fleeting spark in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her parents&#39; gravestones, Yvonne spoke only of the bright moments in their marriage,painting pictures of laughter and small joys while leaving all the shadows unmentioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recounted everyday details-incidents so minor Julian had long forgotten-but in her telling, they sounded like priceless keepsakes she had been guarding in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s gaze grew more complicated the longer she spoke, and for the first time, he truly grasped how much he had overlooked her in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they made their way back to the car, silence settled between them. They walked under the same umbrella, yet the only rhythm was the soft crunch of their footsteps on the wet path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before they reached the cemetery gates, Yvonne suddenly halted. With a wistful curve of her lips, she looked at him and murmured, &#34;Thank you-for what you said in front of my parents, and for being here with me today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Julian hadn&#39;t truly meant those words, Yvonne still felt grateful he had spoken them. She couldn&#39;t bear the thought of her parents, even in death, believing there was no affection left in her marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she offered him only formal gratitude, Julian&#39;s brows drew together. That wasn&#39;t what he&#39;d wanted.His words hadn&#39;t been meant to earn politeness-he had wished to see her smile at him again, as she once had,without hesitation or guarded distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers pressed a little tighter against the umbrella&#39;s handle, though his expression stayed cool.&#34;Don&#39;t mention it. You played along for my grandfather&#39;s sake-consider this my way of paying you back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remark pierced her more than she cared to admit. So, as she had expected, his kindness had been nothing more than a gesture for the sake of the dead. Lowering her gaze, Yvonne hid the sorrow in her eyes, unwilling to let him glimpse how much his indifference still wounded her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, they had crossed the gates of the cemetery and reached the car. Julian held the door open,his voice gentle but firm. &#34;I&#39;ll drive you back to the Powell estate. You need to rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne hesitated, her hand lingering on the door frame. Her lips pressed into a thin line. &#34;Can&#39;t we wait a few days? I don&#39;t have the energy to pretend in front of Rodger right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression shifted, the light in his eyes hardening, Leaning down, he braced one hand on the door,the other on the roof, effectively caging her in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his face close enough that she could feel the weight of his gaze, Julian&#39;s voice dropped, rough and edged with danger. &#34;So you despise me that much now? You can&#39;t even bring yourself to pretend anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, returning to the Powell estate had been Yvonne&#39;s happiest moment. She would lean into Rodger&#39;s approval, cling tightly to Juian&#39;s arm, and flash him a radiant smile, brimming wwith pride and contentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it really possible for love to vanish in a heartbeat?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought struck Julian with a dull ache, and he searched her face, silently begging for her to deny it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Yvonne turned her head, deliberately avoiding his gaze. Her voice was cool, almost detached.&#34;We&#39;re about to divorce. There&#39;s no point in discussing this anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed him back. &#34;Weren&#39;t we heading to the Powell estate? Let&#39;s go. I&#39;m exhausted-I need to rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian staggered back, momentarily disoriented. Yvonne slid into the car, adjusted the seat with a faint scrape, then pulled her coat over her face, shutting him out completely as she drifted into sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cozy hush of the car surrounded her, pulling her into a deep sleep. When her eyes·fluttered open again,the car was still gliding smoothly down the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere along the ride, the coat slid off, leaving her uncovered beneath the muted glow of the dashboard lights. Yvonne turned her head, catching a glimpse of Julian&#39;s sharp profile-his jaw set, his focus absolute, every line of his face strikingly handsome in the muted light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, she let her gaze linger on him in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car began to slow, rolling to a gradual stop. Without glancing back, Julian&#39;s deep voice cut through the quiet, carrying a tone of cold certainty. long as this marriage hasn&#39;t ended, you&#39;ll keep up the act. You&#39;ll make everyone believe you still love me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did he turn to face her, his expression resolute, his words firm and commanding. &#34;Exactly as you did before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, Yvonne&#39;s teeth sank into her lower lip.</p>
