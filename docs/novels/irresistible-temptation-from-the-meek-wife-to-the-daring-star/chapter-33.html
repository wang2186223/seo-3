                <p>The moment Yvonne stepped into TR Entertainment&#39;s headquarters, she sent a polite message to the HR representative who had contacted her, ready to begin the onboarding process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This job may have been tied to Julian&#39;s demands, but no one here knew she was his wife. She had no intention of pulling strings or using shortcuts; she wanted to go through the same channels as any other new hire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reply told her to wait for a few minutes. But instead of the HR staff, someone else arrived to meet her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From across the lobby, a man in a tailored suit strode forward,surrounded by assistants and staff. His rimless glasses framed a smiling face that carried the polished charm of a seasoned executive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stopping in front of her,he extended his hand warmly.&#34;You must be our new director, Ms. Yvonne Ellis,correct? Brock Fuller, General Manager of TR Entertainment. A pleasure to finally meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Yvonne blinked but quickly recovered, shaking his hand. &#34;It&#39;s an honor, Mr. Fuller.&#34; Still, confusion twisted inside her. First days usually began with paperwork and HR briefings-not a personal welcome from the general manager himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock&#39;s enthusiasm didn&#39;t falter. His gaze lingered on her with a spark of admiration as he turned to those behind him. &#34;Take a good look at Ms. Ellis. Beauty and talent combined. I can already see her future filled with accolades and blockbuster hits. TR Entertainment truly struck gold in bringing her on board.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff echoed their agreement, nodding and murmuring praises. Yvonne&#39;s skin prickled with discomfort. The praise felt too heavy, too rehearsed.She wanted to shrink into her seat and disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s shadow loomed in her thoughts. Had he already spoken to them about her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she wrestled with the unease, Brock leaned closer, his tone warm and confident. &#34;I&#39;ve gone through your resume in detail-it&#39;s impressive. As it happens, we&#39;re preparing a major project, a blockbuster with a budget over one hundred million. I believe it&#39;s a perfect fit for you. Shall I have the script sent over for you to review?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s thoughts tangled into knots. Julian had thrown down an impossible challenge-earn five million on her own. If that was his test, why place a massive project in her lap? Was this his twisted idea of balance, or did Brock truly believe in her abilities?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t unravel it, but the chance was too good to hesitate over. Her lips curved into a grateful smile as she said warmly, &#34;Thank you so much, Mr. Fuller!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock dismissed her thanks with an easy wave before turning to his aide. &#34;Edwin, show Ms. Ellis the script.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin Happer stepped forward at once, his tone brisk but friendly. &#34;Of course. Ms. Ellis, please come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still reeling from the unexpected turn, Yvonne followed him out of the lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she was gone, Brock&#39;s practiced smile melted,his eyes narrowing with calculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of his assistants, unable to hide his confusion,Leaned closer. &#34;Mr. Fuller, I&#39;ve read Yvonne&#39;s file. Yes,she&#39;s well-educated and has won a few minor awards,but she&#39;s still relatively green. Is it really worth giving her this kind of spotlight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock&#39;s gaze flicked to the man, his voice deliberately slow. &#34;You don&#39;t get it, do you? Do you know who insisted she be recruited here?&#34; The assistant blinked, shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was Julian,&#34; Brock replied, his tone carrying weight. &#34;The head of Powell Group-and our largest investor.He personally put her name forward. Does that sound like a woman we can treat as ordinary?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant&#39;s jaw dropped. &#34;Then... is she an illegitimate daughter of thePowell family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock slapped the man lightly across the back of the head. &#34;Idiot! When has Julian ever gone out of his way for any woman? She&#39;s not some hidden child. She&#39;s his wife. The Mrs. Powell the media&#39;s been chasing shadows over. And we&#39;d be fools not to curry favor with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant rubbed his head sheepishly, still looking bewildered. Just then, his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, and his expression shifted in shock.Handing it to Brock, he stammered, &#34;Mr. Fuller... in light of this, do you still think we should keep pleasing Yvonne?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock&#39;s eyes dropped to the phone screen, and the color drained from his face. He staggered back a step,so rattled he nearly lost his footing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blazing	across the display	was a bold headline: &#34;Powell Group&#39;s CEO Seen at Baby Boutique with His Wife-The Enigmatic Mrs. Powell Finally Unveiled!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the headline sat a photograph. The angle cut off most of Julian&#39;s features, but his identity was unmistakable. Beside him stood a woman with a gentle smile, her gaze fixed on him with unmistakable tenderness.</p>
