                <p>Snowy sprawled on its back, paws in the air, when a sudden chill crept over the room and froze it in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in her script, Yvonne flipped another page,only to notice a shadow stretching across the bed. She looked up to find Julian standing there, watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze narrowed and settled on Snowy. &#34;It&#39;s getting late. Snowy shouldn&#39;t be in here. Put the dog back where it belongs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian would never let the dog steal his spot on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching his meaning, Snowy gave a dramatic whimper and stared up at Yvonne with pleading eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle smile, Yvonne scooped Snowy into her arms. &#34;It&#39;s all right, sweet thing. You can stay with me tonight.&#34; Julian&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;If Snowy takes this bed,where exactly am I supposed to sleep?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snowy nuzzled closer to Yvonne, trembling as if it could feel Julian&#39;s icy glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Yvonne remembered that they were staying at the Powell estate-separate rooms weren&#39;t an option for Julian here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scanning the room, she pointed at the sofa. &#34;That couch is free. Or you can take the floor if you&#39;re not picky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression darkened instantly, and in the blink of an eye, Snowy was snatched from her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dangling by the neck, the pup whimpered, eyes wet as it reached for Yvonne with tiny cries that pierced her chest. She jumped up, trying to grab it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julian, what do you think you&#39;re doing? Stop scaring Snowy!&#34; she snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his long stride kept him ahead, holding the dog out of her reach. With a stony face, he strode to the sofa,opened the ornate kennel, placed Snowy inside,and latched the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The little pup pawed and whimpered at the entrance,desperate to win some sympathy. Julian&#39;s stern look shut that down in an instant, and Snowy slunk back to its bed without another peep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that, Yvonne&#39;s fury boiled over. &#34;How can you be cruel to even a dog?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian didn&#39;t flinch under the accusation. Instead, he strolled back to the bed at his own pace, stretched out his long frame, and casually claimed half the mattress. With one brow lifted, he said coolly, &#34;I&#39;m claiming my side of the bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re being completely ridiculous!&#34; Yvonne snapped, her patience fraying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritated, she grabbed for his pillow, though the gesture itself looked no different from the antics of a bickering child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her fingers brushed the pillow, his hand shot out and closed firmly around her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, she jerked, trying to pull away. But a sudden cool weight pressed against her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she lifted her arm, an ice-blue diamond bracelet glittered there- the very one she had once thrown aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her ears rang, a dull buzzing drowning out the room.She didn&#39;t know what game Julian was playing,but Rita&#39;s cutting words from that day came rushing back, mocking her own foolishness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s face hardened. She stared Julian down,her voice cold. &#34;What exactly are you trying to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted you to have it back. It was meant for you,&#34;Julian answered quietly, his eyes holding hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian had waited for the right time to return it, and after scrolling through her recent shopping history that evening, he decided now was as good a moment as any.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s reaction was swift and sharp. She ripped off the bracelet and hurled it straight at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breathing came in angry bursts, eyes rimmed with red, humiliation written all over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through clenched teeth, she spat, &#34;Am I supposed to thank you for tossing me what someone else has already rejected, like I&#39;m some rubbish bin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bracelet bounced harmlessly off Julian&#39;s face,leaving him shocked and speechless.</p>
