                <p>A shiver coursed through Yvonne, her thoughts scattering into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian tilted her chin upward, his gaze sharp. &#34;Maybe I should summon a doctor right now and uncover exactly what you&#39;re hiding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath steadied as she forced herself to regain control. Gently brushing his hand away, she answered evenly, &#34;You&#39;ve barely been home these past three years, so you wouldn&#39;t know. I once had a traumatic accident at a hospital. Ever since, I can&#39;t stand the idea of medical treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crease in Julian&#39;s brow deepened-he hadn&#39;t known that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But since you insist, I&#39;ll see a doctor,&#34; Yvonne continued, her voice calm, decisive. &#34;I have one I trust.I&#39;Ll call him here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Julian hesitated. Then he gave a curt nod, unwilling to push further. Deep down, guilt gnawed at him-three years of neglect had left him little ground to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne pulled out her phone, her tone softening as she dialed. &#34;Spencer, I&#39;m suffering a fever. Do you have time to come over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s head snapped up, eyes darkening as her words sank in. He swallowed the anger rising in his throat,his expression tightening. He should have known-of course she would call Spencer. Who else could she lean on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely ten minutes passed before the doorbell rang.Julian&#39;s face soured as he strode to open the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing in the hall was Spencer, crisp in a tailored suit despite the late hour, gold-rimmed glasses glinting beneath the light. To Julian, he looked like a showy peacock, smug and shameless, circling what wasn&#39;t his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold laugh escaped Julian, ready to spill venom, but Spencer swept past him without a glance, heading straight for Yvonne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yvonne,how did you end up with such a high fever?&#34;Spencer&#39;s voice softened with concern as he bent toward her. &#34;Is it because you&#39;ve been living alone with no one to look after you? Do you want to move in with me instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian shoved the door closed, the echoing slam reverberating through the apartment-a sharp reminder that his presence loomed over them both. Neither Yvonne nor Spencer flinched. Their silence carried the weight of unspoken agreement: Julian didn&#39;t matter in this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice, soft and steady, broke the air. &#34;Not that bad.Thank you for worrying about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer only shook his head,already pulling open his medical kit. With calm precision, he began checking her over, his focus entirely on Yvonne, as though Julian were nothing more than a shadow in the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours crept by. At last, Yvonne swallowed the medicine Spencer prescribed and slipped into a deep,fevered sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the two men stepped out of her room, Julian&#39;s gaze hardened into ice. &#34;The examination is finished.Dr.Patel,you can leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer met his stare directly, refusing to yield.&#34;Leave? This isn&#39;t your place, Julian. This is Yvonne&#39;s apartment. As her friend, it&#39;s only natural I stay and look after her. The real question is-what about you?She doesn&#39;t seem so eager to have you here, does she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sneer twisted Julian&#39;s mouth. &#34;You seem to forget she&#39;s my wife. I don&#39;t need permission to be in her home. Tell me, Dr. Briggs-the Briggs Group is up for that outstanding-enterprise award this year, isn&#39;t it?What would your grandfather think if he learned you spent the night at another man&#39;s wife&#39;s apartment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer&#39;s jaw clenched, fury flashing in his eyes. &#34;If you were half the man you claim to be, you&#39;d stop chaining Yvonne to a life that only hurts her. Husband or not, you&#39;ve given her nothing. You don&#39;t deserve her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s retort came like a whip crack. &#34;Whether I deserve her or not isn&#39;t your decision. Until the day l sign those divorce papers, she is still my wife!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air thickened, their locked glares sparking with hostility. Then, breaking the moment, Spencer&#39;s phone buzzed. One glance at the screen altered his expression. He cast Julian a sharp look, then turned away to answer the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, Spencer ended the call with a hardened expression, slipping his phone into his pocket before fixing Julian with a stern look. &#34;I left some light food for Yvonne. When she wakes up,make sure she eats it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started toward the door but paused halfway,glancing back over his shoulder. &#34;She deserves to be looked after-don&#39;t forget that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian answered with a derisive snort, bristling at the audacity. To him, Spencer was nothing more than an intruder with no right to lecture him about his own wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door clicked shut behind Spencer, leaving the apartment wrapped in silence. Julian strode back into the bedroom, his gaze landing on the thermos set neatly on the bedside table. A cold laugh escaped his lips. Without hesitation, he scooped it up and tossed it straight into the trash.</p>
