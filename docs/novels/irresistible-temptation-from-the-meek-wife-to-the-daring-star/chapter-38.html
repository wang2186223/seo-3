                <p>The line went dead after a short silence, and the abruptness of it made Yvonne&#39;s lips curl in satisfaction.Getting even right away had never felt so gratifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s earlier words echoed in her mind, and they gave her the confidence she needed to strike back without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cast a glance toward the bathroom, and her chest softened in spite of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was his explanation a hint that he still cared for her?Or had he only said it to keep her from complaining to Roger?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>rvonne&#39;s thoughts twisted in every direction as she set the phone back down, caught between believing Julian and doubting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could sort through her confusion, the bathroom door swung open. Steam drifted out, and Yvonne froze in disbelief, her wide eyes locked on the sight before her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian stepped into view with nothing but a towel slung low on his hips, his chest and shoulders as striking as if they had been carved by an artist&#39;s hand What unsettled her even more was the realization that the bath towel he was using was hers. The sight of that pink towel on such a serious man was so ridiculous that it almost robbed her of words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flustered, Yvonne covered her face with her palm,peeking through her fingers as she stammered,&#34;Why are you using my towel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian lifted a brow and spoke as if he were entirely innocent. &#34;You didn&#39;t bring me one, so I had to use yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rushed into her cheeks, and her voice cracked between outrage and embarrassment. &#34;That&#39;s my towel. Take it off right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes glimmered with a playful spark, and Yvonne&#39;s stomach dropped in alarm. By the time she realized what he intended, it was too late. Julian&#39;s hand moved to the edge of the towel as though he would actually undo it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne blurted in a panic,&#34;Stop! Don&#39;t move. I&#39;ll grab you something to wear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without givinng him another glance, she rushed out of the room, her footsteps quick and uneven. A moment later, she sfumbled back in with a plain T-shirt and a pair of men&#39;s shorts clutched tightly in her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s gaze darkened the instant he saw them. His voice carried an edge as he asked, &#34;Why do you have men&#39;s clothes here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question sank deeper, and his tone turned heavier,almost accusing. &#34;Do these belong to Spencer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The implication stung, and his jaw tightened with fury at the thought of another man leaving his belongings in her home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of shrinking back, Yvonne rolled her eyes,exasperated. &#34;Why would Spencer&#39;s clothes be here?These are yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian blinked in surprise, his stern face slipping into confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne hugged the bundle of clothes to her chest,her voice dropping into something soft, almost wistful. &#34;When we just got married, I bought matching outfits for us. You never wore them, though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t reproaching him. Her tone carried no bitterness, only a quiet acceptance of the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when she had packed to leave, she hadn&#39;t taken much from his place. Yet somehow, those couple outfits had found their way into her suitcase. Maybe she hadn&#39;t been ready to let them go. She remembered the bright, buzzing happiness of their early days, when she bought sets of everything -pajamas,toothbrushes, even mugs-dreaming of a life where they&#39;d share the smallest details together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Julian had never noticed any of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he stood wordless, his face unreadable. After a long pause, he plucked the clothes from her hands with an almost careless gesture and said, &#34;You&#39;ve got good taste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remark jolted Yvonne from her drifting memories.She blinked, dazed, her chest tight with emotions she couldn&#39;t quite name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian made no fuss as he started pulling on fresh clothes, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The towel slipped away, and the sudden flash of his private part left Yvonne&#39;s cheeks burning</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after everything they had shared before, she still couldn&#39;t stop herself from whipping her head aside, her voice sharp and flustered. &#34;Can&#39;t you at least change in another room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re married. There&#39;s nothing left for us to hide from each other,&#34; Julian answered with an icy calm that carried an irritatingly smug edge, completely  unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s teeth clenched as her patience frayed. &#34;Fine.Then you can enjoy the sofa in the living room tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows drew together, a frown tugging at his expression. &#34;You expect me to squeeze in with that mutt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s temper flared hotter.&#34;My puppy has a name.It&#39;S-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never got to finish. In the blink of an eye, Julian was right behind her, his fingers closing firmly around her hand. The sudden contact made her yelp, and as she stumbled backward, she dragged him down with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mattress caught them both, and Julian ended up above her, their bodies pressed close. Silence stretched between them as their eyes locked,breath brushing breath, the unspoken tension louder than words.</p>
