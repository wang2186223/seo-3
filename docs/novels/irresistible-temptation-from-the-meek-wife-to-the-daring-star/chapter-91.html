                <p>By the time Yvonne opened her eyes the next morning, Julian was nowhere to be seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand drifted across the sheets, the cool emptiness telling her he had been gone for hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, his absences had been constant. Even on nights he stayed over, she rarely woke to find him by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She convinced herself his sudden tenderness had been nothing but a performance for Rodger&#39;s sake,and after their fight last night, he must have decided the show wasn&#39;t worth keeping up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze dropped to the floor as she pushed away the sting of disappointment and headed to wash up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger was missing too, no doubt wasting time with a neighbor over another round of chess. Unbothered,Yvonne finished her meal quickly and set off for work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words Julian had thrown at her the night before still echoed, sparking a fire inside her and fillingher with determination to build her team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arriving at TR Entertainment, she found the elevator lobby packed with silent employees, all waiting in line with unreadable faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her appearance sent a ripple through the crowd,whispers breaking out as she walked past, each conversation buzzing just beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she swiped her card for the exclusive elevator,the buzzing grew louder-some voices tinged with envy, others with bitterness, and a few dripping with sarcasm. But she just ignored them all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the spacious top floor, she slipped into her office,flipped open her laptop, and got straight to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had posted recruitment ads the day before,and resumes were beginning to arrive. Each one she read with meticulous care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This team would carry her name. Every person had to meet the standards she demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden vibration from her bag caught her attention. Yvonne fished out her phone and glanced at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor had sent a photo-a beaming selfie of him and his crew, everyone clutching a flight ticket and grinning ear to ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, his voice message followed.&#34;Yvonne, we&#39;re heading out now! We&#39;ll come see you when we get back. Take care!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne suddenly had an idea. She had spent enough time with Trevor and his group to know their work far surpassed what most in the industry could offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she was being honest, their fees were modest.With Trevor being both wealthy and easygoing, no other team would give that level of quality for such a price. The flight details showed thei plane would be taking off in half an hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne steadied her breath, pressed down on the voice message button, and spoke quickly,her tone laced with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trevor, you still have a passion for filmmaking, don&#39;t you? If I asked you to join my team and shoot movies with me,would you stay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, everyone was on the top floor of TR Entertainment, inside the studio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photography crew wandered through the space,marveling at the sleek, high-end equipment, their voices breaking out in bursts of admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in a smaller office tucked to the side,Yvonne and Trevor sat across from each other,coffee cups in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor took a slow sip, his eyes narrowing as he studied the elegant furnishings. A wry chuckle escaped him. &#34;So... he&#39;s the one who gave you all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Yvonne&#39;s reply was blunt, without hesitation.&#34;But don&#39;t get the wrong idea. For the entire film,he only put in two hundred thousand. Nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, that&#39;s what I&#39;d call petty,&#34; Trevor remarked with a teasing smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne gave a faint smile, though her expression carried a trace of unease. &#34;So,you should know-you won&#39;t make much working with me. And it&#39;s going to be exhausting...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had only meant to test his reaction, unsure if he&#39;d even consider it. Instead, Trevor had shown up with his entire team, ready to dive in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not here for the paycheck,&#34; Trevor cut in, his shoulders lifting in a casual shrug,lips curved with genuine amusement. &#34;Truth is, I&#39;ve always wanted the chance to work with you. I once read the script you left notes on. Those ideas convinced me this collaboration would be worth it.&#34; On Yvonne&#39;s very first day at the company, Brock had arranged for her to review a stack of scripts.She had scribbled her thoughts in the margins, only for the project to later be passed to Rocco. Her annotated copy ended up forgotten in the reading room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By chance, Trevor had been there that same day to sign a deal with the crew. He spotted the annotated script, assumed it was the director&#39;s work, and signed without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never once did he expect the director would later be replaced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing him say this now, a weight lifted off Yvonne&#39;s chest. She smiled in earnest and reached out her hand. &#34;Then let&#39;s make this collaboration count.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trevor clasped her hand firmly, his grin widening.&#34;Absolutely. I&#39;m looking forward to it.&#34;</p>
