                <p>A group of security guards closed in around Yvonne,beads of sweat forming on her brow as confusion overwhelmed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t foreseen this scenario and was unprepared for how to navigate it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a relaxed voice called out from behind,&#34;It&#39;s a misunderstanding. She&#39;s my friend, here to meet me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards halted instantly, and Warren Pictures staff bowed respectfully toward the voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Pearson,&#34; they chorused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right, back to your posts. Everything&#39;s fine,&#34; the man directed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir!&#34; The guards surrounding Yvonne promptly dispersed. Turning, Yvonne saw a man sauntering toward her in a flashy floral shirt and sunglasses, his face radiating cocky confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flashed a smirk and reached to touch her cheek.&#34;Yvonne, what brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before his hand made contact, Yvonne swatted it away,eyeing him warily. &#34;Andrew, what are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was Andrew, a friend of Julian, infamous in Kumvine as a shameless womanizer. Yvonne had always viewed him with disdain, convinced his bond with Julian stemmed solely from their shared privileged upbringing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my family&#39;s company, so naturally, I&#39;m here,&#34;Andrew replied with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed by her rejection, he knew better than to cross her, fearing Julian&#39;s wrath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had come to Warren Pictures for a shareholders&#39;meeting, reluctantly dragged in by his family, and spotted Yvonne entangled with security.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re not here for me, then what&#39;s the deal?&#34;Andrew asked, his tone smug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his attitude, Yvonne saw an opportunity,knowing Warren Pictures was his family&#39;s business.&#34;I&#39;m here to mneet Vince. Can you make an introduction?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t sure why Vince had set up a meeting only for the receptionist to deny it, but she chalked it up to a possible oversight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Vince, Andrew&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;Why are you looking for him? He&#39;s not a good guy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That Andrew, a notorious playboy, would call the respected actor Vince a bad guy struck Yvonne as petty jealousy. Still needing his help, she chose honesty. &#34;I&#39;m producing a film and want him for the starring role.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andrew laughed, his tone mocking, &#34;I thought you were sharp. Why this sudden lapse in judgment? Do you even know what Vince is like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, Yvonne bristled. &#34;Of course I do. Vince is a celebrated actor, known for mentoring newcomers and his warm personality.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Done with the exchange, she turned to leave. &#34;Since you won&#39;t help, I&#39;ll reach out to Vince myself later in another way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind her, Andrew&#39;s eyes narrowed, a cunning smile forming as he called, &#34;Hold on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she glanced back, he lowered his voice,speaking enticingly, &#34;There is an interesting party tonight. Would you like to come and see for yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne spun on her heel and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andrew, slightly embarrassed, cleared his throat and hurried after her, flashing a wide smile. &#34;Don&#39;t run off! I wasn&#39;t done. Vince will be at that party.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne stopped, turning to eye him skeptically.&#34;I don&#39;t trust your intentions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you say that? You&#39;re Julian&#39;s wife-l would never do you wrong,&#34; Andrew said,putting on an innocent face. &#34;Some things are better seen than heard,that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
