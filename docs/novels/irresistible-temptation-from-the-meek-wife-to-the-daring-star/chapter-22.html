                <p>The reply in Yvonne&#39;s inbox carried the logo of a rising force in the industry-TR Entertainment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly dug into their background and was startled to learn they had been founded only three years earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite their short history, the company&#39;s expansion had been explosive, putting them shoulder to shoulder with older,well-established media giants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Countless celebrities had ridden TR Entertainment&#39;s wave to stardom, though the whispers about their contracts painted a harsh picture-crippling penalties for breach, but rewards so dazzling that few dared to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of all the resumes she had scattered into the void without a single reply, this was the only company that called back. Yvonne wasn&#39;t sure whether to chalk it up to luck or fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After wrestling with her doubts, she steeled herself.This chance might never come again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, the standards were notoriously high, but the resources they provided could relaunch her career and,  more importantly, help her cut ties with Julian once and for all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne fired off her acceptance for the interview and immediately scoured every corner of the internet for information about the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By nine o&#39;clock the next morning, she arrived at TR Entertainment&#39;s headquarters. A sleek black trench coat draped over her frame, sunglasses covering her eyes, she cut a sharp figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reception area overflowed with nervous faces,each one likely vying for the same opportunity.Confidence carried her most of the way, yet a twinge of unease crept in-she had been gone from the spotlight for far too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out her documents to review, she was interrupted by a sudden swell of chatter that swept through the waiting area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman&#39;s squeal pierced the noise. &#34;Oh my God,he&#39;s gorgeous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of confusion crossed Yvonne&#39;s face as she lifted her gaze. Julian strode into the room in a perfectly cut suit, his expression sharp and unyielding,with a wall of bodyguards closing in around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes found hers without hesitation, locking onto her like a force she couldn&#39;t break away from. The noise in the waiting room dissolved into silence.Only the pounding of her own heartbeat filled her ears, and all she could see was the man closing the distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian? Why here, of all places?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body refused to move, her fingers tightening around the stack of documents as though they could anchor her in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s eyes brushed over her briefly, then slid away as if she were no more than a stranger. He continued down the hall without hesitation, not sparing her a second look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An emptiness swept through Yvonne, a sting that settled deep in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around her, the waiting area erupted with chatter,voices laced with awe and excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was Julian, wasn&#39;t it? The CEO of the Powell Group.What on earth is he doing here? He&#39;s unbelievably handsome!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard Powell Group just signed a partnership with TR Entertainment. He&#39;s not only gorgeous, but he&#39;s also powerful and rich. His wife must be the luckiest woman alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Totally! Everyone says he worships her. He shields her from the press, and nobody&#39;s ever even seen her photo. That&#39;s what true love looks like. I&#39;d give anything to marry someone like him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd buzzed with admiration, painting a picture of perfection, never realizing the woman they envied was sitting in their midst, silently choking on bitterness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne hadn&#39;t expected the illusion to run so deep.Julian&#39;s PR machine had worked wonders, selling the world a love story that didn&#39;t exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In reality,his silence about her wasn&#39;t devotion-it was distance. He never let her stand beside him where the world could see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lingered on the interview room door, and a heavy breath slipped past her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she remembered Julian&#39;s stake in this company, her resolve faltered. She hadn&#39;t come searching for another chain. She wanted distance,a clean break, and working here would only keep her tethered to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That truth settled heavily on her shoulders, and she made up her mind. This opportunity wasn&#39;t hers to take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing herself to her feet, Yvonne prepared to leave it all behind. The door to the interview room swung open just then, and an HR staff member stepped into the waiting area,voice ringing clear. &#34;Ms. Yvonne Ellis?Please come in for your interview.&#34;</p>
