                <p>The heavy scent of spilled liquor dissipated, leaving a chilling tension in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; Yvonne inquired, seemingly unaware of the menacing stares fixed on her.Kneeling to assist the young man, her tone brimmed with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The frail, disheveled teen shook his head, gazing up at her with eyes reflecting both bewilderment and dread-bewilderment that anyone would defend him in such a merciless place, and dread because the harsh truth loomed. They were like cornered prey amidst ravenous beasts, just him and her, who seemed ill-equipped for a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, escape felt like a distant dream, and her presence only meant another soul doomed to his grim fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely stepping into adulthood, the teenage boy&#39;s courage wavered, tears streaming down his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne, at a loss for how to console him, paused in silence before facing Vince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the cost to free him?&#34; she demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, she knew reasoning with these callous elites was futile; they only valued gain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, Vince&#39;s eyes narrowed, and with a subtle gesture, a bodyguard beside him hesitantly extended a hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince pressed his lit cigar into the guard&#39;s palm,snuffing it out. The guard&#39;s face glistened with sweat from the agony, yet he stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To these affluent elites, the poor were mere playthings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince&#39;s voice was icy. &#34;No amount will free him now.You might even lose yourself here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, a wave of bodyguards advanced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Vince might hesitate to defy Andrew alone, this gathering was a sacred tradition among the elite.Since Yvonne, brought by Andrew, had broken their unspoken code, they deemed her accountable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trembling teen gripped Yvonne&#39;s hand,pleading,&#34;Miss, abandon me and escape. These people are monsters!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne gently tousled his hair, then faced the crowd,drawing her phone. Its screen showed a recording in progress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With unwavering resolve, she declared, &#34;I&#39;ve captured everything that just happened. None of you wants this online, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pandemonium erupted in the space. Most attendees were high-profile figures, celebrities like Vince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne locked eyes with one and said, &#34;Robin Hardy,you just signed with a luxury brand, didn&#39;t you? A scandal now-imagine the contract penalties ruining your career.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, the named celebrity turned pale instantly. She then turned to another. &#34;Adrian Morphew, a world-famous philanthropist, what a shock to find you here...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mustached older man looked panicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne steadily named others, each mention stoking their panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling calmly, she added, &#34;I assure you, every face in this video is unmistakable, leaving no room for denial.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd&#39;s alarm morphed into rage, many directing their fury at Vince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vince, fix this! You hosted this event-if that video leaks, you&#39;re finished too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince&#39;s expression darkened as he glared at Yvonne,then flashed his trademark charming grin. &#34;Let&#39;s see if you can leave this place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised a hand with a casual wave. &#34;Seize that phone!&#34; A horde of bodyguards surged toward Yvonne and the teen. Grabbing the boy, Yvonne spun to flee but tripped, her ankle twisting as she fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards surrounded them. Vince approached with a sinister smirk. &#34;You bitch, I&#39;ll make you regret this!&#34;His hand rose to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that instant, a commanding voice boomed. &#34;I dare anyone to lay a finger on her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes turned as the villa&#39;s main gate burst open,a man striding in, flanked by his own bodyguards.</p>
