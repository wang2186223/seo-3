                <p>Yvonne&#39;s brows knit together.&#34;So sudden-why now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer&#39;s lips curved, but the bitterness behind his smile betrayed him. Not long ago, he had refused the hospital director&#39;s invitation to join a prestigious neurology research project overseas. Somehow, his grandfather, Frey Briggs, had learned of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frey rarely meddled, but when it came to Spencer&#39;s future, his stance was ironclad. He had wasted no time applying pressure, forcing Spencer into a corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ultimatum had been clear. If Spencer rejected the opportunity, Frey would arrange a marriage for him without his consent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he accepted and returned triumphant, however, Frey promised the Briggs family would stay out of his personal life-even if that meant allowing his ties with Yvonne, a married woman, to remain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Spencer&#39;s mind, there was no doubt. Julian had engineered this behind the scenes, manipulating Frey into action. The thought made his blood boiI, though he was powerless to fight it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept those truths buried. He didn&#39;t want Yvonne to see him as a man shackled by his family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he masked his turmoil with a careless shrug, his smile light as air. &#34;It&#39;s only a research project. Six months at most, and I&#39;ll be back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, silence stretched between them. His eyes lingered on her, heavy with something unspoken,before he reached out to ruffle her hair with rare tenderness.&#34;|just hope that by then, you and Julian will have settled everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gesture startled her. She edged back, forcing a polite smile. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about me. I&#39;ll manage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand fell to his side, empty, disappointment flickering across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of white outside caught his eye. Parked by the curb was a Range Rover-Frey&#39;s men, waiting to take him to the airport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the moment of farewel pressed closer, Spencer drew in a steadying breath and asked, hls voice laced with hope, &#34;Yvonne... if I comé back and you&#39;re no longer with Juflan, would you ever consider giving me a chance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression faltered, the question catching her off guard. A sigh stirred inéide her chest, heavy and complicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to wound him, yet she also couldn&#39;t give him the answer he longed for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer caught the hesitation in her face and already knew what her answer would be, but he couldn&#39;t bring himself to hear it aloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clung to a fragile hope-if Yvonne said nothing, then maybe, just maybe, he still had a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could respond, he cut in with a forced smile, &#34;I was only joking. Don&#39;t take it so seriously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding a hand ihto his pocket, he pulled out a business card and placed it in her palm. &#34;This is a friend of mine.I&#39;ve told him about your situation. If you need help while I&#39;m gone,reach out to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze wavered as she looked down at the card. A photograph of a bespectacled young man with a round face sat in the corner-Rich Thorpe, another surgeon like Spencer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest tightened with both gratitude and guilt. &#34;Spencer...&#34; she whispered softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t let her finish. With a wave of his hand, he strode toward the waiting white Range Rover, his steps brisk, his posture light as if he carried no weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before climbing inside, he turned back, flashing her a wide smile.&#34;Don&#39;t forget your promise to me-take care of yourself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne stood frozen, her eyes following Spencer as he climbed into the car. He waved with a carefree ease,as though partings meant nothing at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her own hand in response, but he never turned again. All she had left was the imprint of his bright smile lingering in her mind. The vehicle rolled away, wheels kicking up dust that blurred into the gray sky. The weight of farewell pressed heavily on her chest, and before long, raindrops began to fall, soft and cool against her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting her head back, she let one bead of water land in her palm, her heart twisting with quiet sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goodbyes had always unsettled her. Whether they marked the end of life or simply the distance of separation, they never failed to hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An umbrella suddenly appeared above her, shielding her from the rain. A tall figure stepped in close, his shadow falling naturally across her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s voice came steady, calm, carrying no trace of hesitation. &#34;Let&#39;s go home.&#34;</p>
