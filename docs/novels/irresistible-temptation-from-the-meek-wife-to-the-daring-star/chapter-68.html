                <p>Julian&#39;s features hardened into a somber mask, though the flush of embarrassment still slipped through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For as long as he could remember, he had chased excellence-always top of his class, always the genius others admired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet here, at the simplest tasks of the kitchen, he kept failing where others thrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a beat of silence, he forced steadiness into his voice, as though reclaiming a fragment of dignity. &#34;Next time,I&#39;ll make it better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cooking wasn&#39;t something that could be mastered in a single attempt. He believed that with repetition, with persistence,even this arena would eventually bow to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without realizing it, he had already resigned himself to being the one who would cook for Yvonne in the days to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corner of Yvonne&#39;s lips curved despite herself. She lifted another bite from the platter, only for Julian to intercept with a frown, his hand halting her midway. &#34;Don&#39;t bother with that. I&#39;ll get Morton to pick up some proper food and bring it by later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne ignored·his warning, chewing and swallowing without a flicker of emotion. Arching one brow, she quipped, &#34;Well, it&#39;s not a total disaster-at the very least, the nutrition&#39;s balanced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s face twisted with a mix of pride and humiliation. He lowered himself into the chair, scooped up a bite, and forced it into his mouth. The bitterness made his brows knot instantly, but when he saw Yvonne eating as though it were a delicacy, he clenched his jaw and swallowed the mess instead of spitting it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she set her utensils down, satisfied, Julian had already begun stacking plates. He carried them into the kitchen and calmly turned on the tap to wash them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light mood faltered a moment later when a sharp pang twisted in her stomach. She covered her mouth,retching softly, and the discomfort reminded her she couldn&#39;t forget her prenatal supplements. She cast a glance toward the kitchen, where Julian was still wrestling with the dishes, before slowing her steps. Pouring herself a glass of water, she discreetly pulled a pill bottle from her bag, tipped a few into her palm, and swallowed them with a careful sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over her at the thought of Rodger granting the servants a week off. With fewer eyes in the house, the chances of anyone noticing her medication-and letting it slip to Rodger or Julian-were slim.That would have been far too troublesome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she turned, she was struck motionless. Julian stood in the doorway, pink apron still tied around his waist, dishwashing gloves dripping with suds, his gaze locked on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Yvonne instinctively tucked her bag behind her and forced a nervous laugh. &#34;All done in there?What brings you out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was going to ask what happens if I use too much soap...&#34; His voice was quiet, though his eyes were fixed on the pill bottle sitting openly on the coffee table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression darkened slightly as he asked, &#34;You&#39;re on medication? What kind is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Yvonne realized she had hidden her bag too hastily-the medicine bottle still sat exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snatched it up, her pulse quickening, and when she caught sight of the harmless vitamin label, a wave of relief steadied her nerves. Trying to look casual, she gave the bottle a little shake. &#34;Vitamin C. Is there a problem with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian stayed silent, his eyes locked on her with unnerving intensity. The heat of his stare unsettled her, and she instinctively looked away. Her throat tightened, but she forced out a light cough before murmuring, &#34;I&#39;m exhausted. I&#39;ll get some rest now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, she spun around and made for the stairs, her steps quick and unsteady,betraying the edge of panic clinging to her retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s suspicions solidified-the bottle had to contain something far more serious than Vitamin C.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tugged off the sudsy gloves, pulled out his phone, and immediately called Morton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the line clicked alive, his voice was clipped and icy.&#34;Morton, are the lab results for that medication back yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Powell, I was just about to update you,&#34; Morton answered promptly.&#34;The tests finished a moment ago-I&#39;ve already sent the report to your inbox.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian ended the call without another word. Opening the fresh email, he scanned the report, his expression hardening as a shadow settled across his eyes.</p>
