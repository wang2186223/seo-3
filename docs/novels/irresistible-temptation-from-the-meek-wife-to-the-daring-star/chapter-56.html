                <p>Both Julian&#39;s and Yvonne&#39;s expressions flickered with nervousness for a split second. But Yvonne quickly masked it with a soft smile, slipping her arm through Julian&#39;s and leaning against him with practiced warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Rodger and teased lightly, &#34;Yes, we were quarreling. He stayed with me the whole night,and now I&#39;m angry he doesn&#39;t look after himself.What if I get better only for him to fall sick?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger narrowed his eyes at Julian, suspicion lacing his tone. &#34;Is that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s gaze wavered, landing on Yvonne with a layered, unreadable look. She met it coolly, her eyes sharp with silent warning-play along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing his lips into a faint smile, Julian steadied himself and guided her back against the pillows. His hand brushed her forehead with a tenderness that looked natural enough. In a voice lowered to near a whisper, he murmured, &#34;I&#39;m not that fragile. What you need is proper rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two, still simmering from their spat a moment earlier, carried a tension that made their performance feel strained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, with their backs turned, Rodger didn&#39;t catch the fleeting bitterness in their expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian forced a pleasant look onto his face before turning toward Rodger. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Grandpa.Yvonne and I are doing perfectly fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s doubtful gaze lingered, pressing Yvonne to deflect with a quick smile. &#34;Rodger, what brings you here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came for a follow-up,&#34; he replied curtly, then shot Paula a sharp glance. With a huff, he added, &#34;If I hadn&#39;t happened to see Paula carrying food, I&#39;d still be in the dark about Yvonne&#39;s condition. Were you planning to keep this from me forever?&#34; Julian&#39;s face flushed with embarrassment, and Yvonne instinctively darted him a startled glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sudden hospitalization was something Paula couldn&#39;t have possibly known about on her own-Julian must have been the one who asked her to prepare the meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger remained oblivious to the silent exchange and turned his full attention to Yvonne. His voice softened with concern as he asked, &#34;How did you end up falling into the water like that? You didn&#39;t hurt yourself,did you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the words left his mouth, his expression hardened again. He shot Julian a sharp glare and scolded, &#34;What were you thinking? You can&#39;t even manage to take proper care of your own wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne gave an awkward little laugh, just about to step in to defend Julian. But before she could, Julian lowered his head, his tone steady and sincere.&#34;This was on me. I didn&#39;t protect Yvonne the way I should have. It won&#39;t happen again.&#34; For a moment Yvonne froze, as though a needle had slipped into her heart, her eyes shimmering with a thin glaze of tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t tell if Julian&#39;s tenderness was sincere or just another performance meant to placate Rodger-and deceive her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger, on the other hand, seemed satisfied.He gave a pleased nod and told Paula to bring out the meal prepared specially for Yvonne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The salad and toasts appeared, perfectly made,worlds apart from Julian&#39;s earlier attempts in the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s expression tightened as if the sight reminded him of his own lackluster cooking. Turning aside, he muttered, his voice edged with irritation, &#34;You&#39;re still recovering. Greasy food isn&#39;t good for you, so l had Paula make something light instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne quietly agreed. Her stomach felt weak, and she had no appetite for anything heavier. Meanwhile, Rodger jabbed Julian lightly with the tip of his cane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian turned his head, brows knitting in confusion,until he noticed Rodger tilting his chin toward Yvonne. Realization dawned, and Julian&#39;s shoulders stiffened.He hesitated a beat too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger, clearly annoyed, gave him a sharper prod that made Julian grunt under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound drew Yvonne&#39;s attention. She lifted her gaze, eyes questioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian pressed his lips together, stepped closer, and smoothly took the spoon from her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden jolt of surprise made her blink. &#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With quiet determination, Julian met her eyes. &#34;When you&#39;re sick, it&#39;s my responsibility to take care of you.&#34;</p>
