                <p>Rodger lingered at the doorway, making Yvonne wary of resisting too hard. She subtly pressed her palms against Julian&#39;s chest and hissed under her breath, &#34;What on earth are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quiet.&#34; Julian&#39;s thumb brushed over her lips, silencing her. He bent closer, his voice a hushed breath against her ear. &#34;&#39;Grandpa&#39;s watching.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heat of his words grazed her skin, raising goosebumps along her arms. Her fingers clenched reflexively,and she forced down a nervous swallow. &#34;Even so, you had no right to kiss me like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He eased back just enough to meet her gaze, his tone calm but firm. &#34;It wasn&#39;t for me-it was for him. If we look swept up in each other, Grandpa won&#39;t question a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s eyes darted toward the doorway, catching sight of Rodger&#39;s wide, satisfied grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian cupped her cheek lightly, his thumb grazing the warm flush there. A teasing glimmer lit his eyes.&#34;That blush of yours is impossible to miss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mortified, Yvonne pushed him away, her ears burning hotter by the second.&#34;Fine then-cook by yourself!&#34;she snapped, flustered, before hurrying off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian watched her retreat, lips curving into an amused, knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not much later, a strange scorched smell began to waft through the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s nerves tightened-this wasn&#39;t just making toasts anymore. Was Julian about to set the place on fire?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right as her worry spiked, her phone buzzed with a message from him. &#34;Dinner&#39;s ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible he&#39;d really managed to make a meal?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still doubtful, she headed for the dining room. The table was neatly set, complete with four dishes and a soup. But the food itseIf looked like a catastrophe-some parts were scorched black, others dyed with unsettling colors. No matter how carefully it had been plated, none of it looked safe to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s mouth twitched as he took in the sight. Then, with a dramatic slap to his forehead, he groaned,&#34;Ah, I just remembered! I have an invitation for a game of chess. I&#39;m terribly late-don&#39;t bother waiting for me to eat!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, he wheeled himself out at surprising speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s sudden exit left Yvonne sighing in disbelief. She still couldn&#39;t wrap her head around how easily he&#39;d slipped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze drifted to Julian, who sat stiffly with his lips pressed into a thin line, his expression shadowed with the awareness of how disastrous his cooking truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unexpected flicker of sympathy rose in her chest. Not wanting to crush what pride he had left, she pulled out a chair and settled at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casting her eyes over the bizarre spread, she searched for the faintest silver lining before finally blurting out, &#34;Well... it&#39;s certainly something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s stare pinned her in place. &#34;You mean that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question tightened around her like a trap. For a moment, she was back at the memory of choking down his meal, reminding herself that this situation wasn&#39;t all that different-and maybe, just maybe, she could endure it again..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding onto the thought, she lifted a slice of potato, paused wit it in her fingers, then quietly set it back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking for a distraction, she inquired, &#34;Where are Jordy and Sharon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger might have excused the servants, but surely he couldn&#39;t have dismissed Julian&#39;s parents as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordy&#39;s absence made sense-being a chief diplomat, he spent much of the year overseas-but Sharon was another matter. She was supposed to be home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian hesitated, then replied in a low voice, &#34;Dad&#39;s away on business. As for Mom... Grandpa sent her and Aunt Nadine on vacation about a month ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In other words, Rodger had spent a month planning this down to the last detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne pressed her fingers to her forehead, torn between marveling at Rodger&#39;s scheming and being stunned that he had discovered their discord an entire month ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s eyes flicked to the potato slice left on her plate, his voice tinged with expectation. &#34;Why aren&#39;t you eating?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Yvonne forced herself to lift the piece and chew. Her face puckered almost instantly in sheer distaste. &#34;How can you still be this bad at cooking? It&#39;s just as bad as the toast disaster from before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of panic crossed Julian&#39;s face before he straightened stubbornly. &#34;What toast? I never made you any.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting down her fork, Yvonne&#39;s lips curved with quiet amusement.&#34;Oh,come on. I don&#39;t know anyone else capable of making something this terrible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s expression darkened, his pride crumbling beneath the jab.</p>
