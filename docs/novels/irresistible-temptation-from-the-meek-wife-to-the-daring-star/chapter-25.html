                <p>Yvonne&#39;s lips curved in a bitter smile as she stared at the email. Julian had left her no exit, deliberately hemming her in until she had no choice but to crawvl to TR Entertainment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp, derisive snort escaped her. Rolling onto her side, she snatched up her phone, unblocked Julian&#39;s number, and jabbed the call button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line buzzed in long,hollow tones before cutting off without an answer. Of course-this was him retaliating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw tightened. Instead of calling again, she flicked through her contacts and landed on Morton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he picked up, Yvonne&#39;s voice was rigid,brimming with rage. &#34;What the hell is Julian playing at?Did he tell those companies to turn me down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morton hesitated, his tone careful. &#34;Mrs. Powell...I strongly suggest you don&#39;t confront Mr. Powell directly. The résumés you sent-they all ended up back in my hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s blood boiled, her grip on the phone turning white-knuckled.&#34;Where the fuck is Julian? Put him on. I want him to answer me right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morton cleared his throat before answering, &#34;I was about to tell you-Mr. Powell&#39;s at the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne halted in shock, her eyes widening.&#34;What?Why is he in the hospital?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of the man who always seemed sO vigorous suddenly collapsing seemed ridiculous. Then,an unsettling guess came to her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morton&#39;s voice carried through the line, heavy with gravity. &#34;Rodger was rushed into the emergency room.He fell seriously ill without warning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone slipped from her trembling fingers,clattering loudly against the floor. Heart pounding, she snatched it up again, fighting to steady her breath.&#34;Which hospital?&#34; she demanded, her voice shaky but determined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morton&#39;s voice came steady through the phone. &#34;I&#39;ve already sent you the address.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne ended the call without another word and darted out of the apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the cab speeding toward the hospital, she clasped her hands tightly together, whispering silent prayers for Rodger&#39;s safety For three long years, Rodger had been her shield and her comfort. In her heart, he was no less than a real grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the taxi stopped at Kumvine Hospital, she hurried inside, following the directions Morton had forwarded. The scent of disinfectant clung to the VIP wing as she made her way down the hushed corridor.She reached the room at last. Just as her palm touched the handle, the sound of laughter spilled out through the narrow gap in the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne froze, peering through the crack. Inside, Rita stood beside Julian at the bedside, her words drawing a hearty laugh from Rodger. Julian&#39;s lips curved into the faintest of smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight struck Yvonne like a blade. They looked like a picture-perfect couple, standing shoulder to shoulder as if they were the ones keeping vigil for family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She froze at the doorway, feeling like an intruder who didn&#39;t belong. Hovering there, she wavered, unsure if she should step in or retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew the moment she entered, the air would tighten with awkwardness. Perhaps it would&#39;ve been better to stay away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her throat burned as teas pricked her eyes. She  loosened her hand from the doorknob, ready to slip away unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then Rodger spotted her and called out cheerfully,&#34;Yvonne, come inside!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All three heads turned at once. As expected, Julian&#39;s faint smile evaporated, replaced by his signature frost His brows knitted, his gaze hardening the moment it landed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he really couldn&#39;t stand the sight of her? The realization stabbed through her chest. Still, she couldn&#39;t turn down Rodger&#39;s invitation. Forcing a strained smile,she stepped into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rodger, how are you? What happened to make you fall ill so suddenly?&#34; she inquired, her concern soft but genuine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger flicked his wrist carelessly, his tone light. &#34;It&#39;s nothing serious, just an old ailment. No need to fuss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rita leaned in with a gentle smile, her voice sweet.&#34;Yvonne, don&#39;t worry. I already gave Rodger the special prescription Dr. Carter developed. It&#39;s been working wonders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yvonne&#39;s chest tightened. Rita wasn&#39;t simply reassuring ler-she was showing off. Pregnant with Julian&#39;s child and now posing as Rodger&#39;s savior, it was only a matter of time before Rita pushed her aside and took her place as Julian&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined not to reveal her unease, Yvonne curved her lips into a polite smile. &#34;Thank you, Ms. Adams.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Julian, her emotions surging, though she hid every flicker of it for Rodger&#39;s sake. Her tone softened. &#34;Honey, can we talk for a moment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s gaze lifted toward her, a faint nod just beginning-when Rita suddenly pressed a hand to her temple and stumbled straight into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julian... I feel so dizzy,&#34; she murmured weakly,her voice dripping with fragility.</p>
