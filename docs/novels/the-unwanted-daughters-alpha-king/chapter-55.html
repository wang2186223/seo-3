                <p>I looked at Rhys expectantly. He looked drained from the day, but I still felt I deserved an explanation. I was feeling a lot of things, some of which I wasn’t sure were warranted, but I needed to know for myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s kind of complicated and long.” He said after a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I have time.” I answered dryly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You do.” He replied with a hint of a smirk. “Okay. So, I killed my other fiancés because they had ulterior motives, and when I discovered them, a lot of times it was safer to just it like that. Some tried to poison me and take over my throne, several slept with my twin, Caleb as a back-up plan, some were just trying to gain power and weren’t good at it, and a couple of them actually had plans to overthrow the whole kingdom. But Allison, she’s not a good person, but she also didn’t do any of those things. Her family arranged our meeting. They were seeking power, and her pack wasn’t under my protection, nor was it an ally of any kind. She told me of her families plans, ultimately betraying them, and helping me reclaim their pack as a part of mine. That’s why I let her live because she was honest with me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay...” I said slowly, not satisfied with the information given to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I know that might seem like a mistake,” Rhys added quickly. “And maybe it was, but at the time, I couldn’t justify killing her. She has become more and more obsessive with time, but back then she stood by my side through everything, and I felt like it was a felt like it was a fair exchange.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made some sense, kind of, but it didn’t make me feel any better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Did you ever love her?” I asked hesitantly, not sure I wanted to know the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Alpha King surprised me by smiling at the question, and I felt confused till I heard the hint of laughter in his voice. “No, Gracie. No, I never loved her. She might love me, though I think her illusion of love is a bit twisted, but I have never had any feelings toward her romantically. And I will never reciprocate those feelings she has. She isn’t the one I want.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Then why is she here?” I asked, but the question was barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That is something that I should have warned you about, and I’m really sorry. Everything has just happened so fast, and I just didn’t think about it.” He paused, pulling me in closer to him. “Every time I have brought someone home after her, she has shown up. Usually, she tries to intimidate them and let me know that she’s still around. And if her head, she’s the better option, no matter who they are. I have warned her that she is not to come near you, Grace, and that if she tries anything again, I will not be so lenient. You are the most important thing in the world to me, Grace. If she tries anything, there will be hell to pay for her.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you think that will actually keep her at bay?” I asked. She seemed like she really loved him, and if it was me on the outside, I don’t know what I wouldn’t do to prove my love. I was already struggling with that aspect, and I wasn’t even on the outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Honestly?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. Yes. I needed him to be honest with me. Not just now though, but always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No.” He answered, lifting me so that I was sitting on his lap facing him. “I don’t think it will keep her at bay. I think she will disregard everything I have told her and probably make a mess of things. But then we will at least know what’s going on instead of being blind to whatever she ends up planning.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged.  I didn’t think his plan was going to go the way he was thinking it would, but I wasn’t going to be the one to tell him that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Until we know what’s going on with her, Grace, just promise me you’ll be careful, and let me know if you have any problems, okay?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, but doubt had sort of settled in soul. Would he believe my word against hers if anything did happen? Or would I be in trouble and accused of lying? I felt overwhelmed by everything that was happening. A new mate who had an ex-fiancé, who may or may not be planning to kill me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You still feel like you&#39;re in turmoil.” The Alpha King said with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t know what to say.” I told him honestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What are you afraid of?” He asked, his hand cupping my face, his thumb tracing my jaw line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That you’ll realize how pathetic I am and chose her.” I answered honestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze for a moment before saying, “Gracie, you are not pathetic. You are literally one of the strongest people I have ever met. I have chosen you. We have always been destined for each other. That’s why none of my other relationships have ever worked out. I wasn’t meant for them. I was meant for you. And only you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words sounded nice, but I wasn’t sure I believed them, even though I wanted to. I gave him a small smile as a ‘I’m trying to believe in us’ offering, even though I wasn’t exactly sure where I stood with everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s going to be okay, Gracie.” He said softly as he rested his forehead on mine. “I promise.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in that moment, I chose to believe in his promise as we sat there on the ground in the garden, just breathing each other in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few minutes of silence, Rhys phone buzzed, and he pulled it out of his pocket, and read whatever it said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Perfect.” He said aloud, but I don’t think he was talking to me as he texted whoever it was back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then slid his phone back into his pocket and smiled at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Come on,” He said, nudging me with his knee to get up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Where are we going?” I asked as I brushed the dirt off me, then took the hand he was offering me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I found you a mentor, and we’re going to meet him.”</p>
