                <p>I had never been with a female during the heat before, so I hadn’t really known what exactly to expect. But for 3 days, Grace’s body craved all things sexual. She had been ravenous and bold, taking what she wanted at times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For three days, we didn’t leave our room. Leon brought all our meals to the door, and sat them out there for whenever, we needed to refuel. Sawyer stayed on another level of the house, so he wouldn’t be tempted by the scent of her heat. And we had only had brief moments of peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace’s temperature was starting to go down as she tiredly kissed up and down my body, making me feel blissful. Her lips met mine for only a couple of moments, and it lacked the hunger she had had before. She then laid her head back on her pillow, and it didn’t take long for her to fall asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been three days of heaven. Grace had started being bolder by day two, taking lead sometimes, something I had not been expecting. I could still taste her lips on mine. But I was exhausted. I had asked Leon over the mindlink if he was always this exhausted when his wife’s heat finishes, and he just laughed at me, and said ‘congrats on becoming a real man’.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he teased me, Leon and Sawyer were both able to help manage pack things while I was incapacitated. I also made sure they let Arlo know that we would have to pause Grace’s tutoring sessions. When I wasn’t engaged in sexual activity, I was sleeping or eating, and I usually had to make a choice between the two, there was never quite enough time for both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing Grace would be asleep for quite a while due to her own exhaustion, I made my way downstairs to my office. I was always grateful for Leon and Sawyer for being able to pick up the slack, I hated being away from my duties. It always felt like I was letting down my people, even if that wasn’t true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started with my emails and then made my way to the stacks of paperwork on my desk. Even with Leon and Sawyer helping, there was so much that hadn’t gotten done. Mostly things about pack alliances that they would need my decisions on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hey,” Leon popped his head into my office, a look of surprise on his face. “I didn’t know you were back.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace is sleeping,” I told him. “It seems like she’s back to normal. I mean this is the longest she’s slept.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Good, good,” Leon said absently, and I noticed the worry on his face. “So, we have a little bit of a situation going on.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s wrong?” I asked. My mind immediately jumped to the Red Blood pack, maybe something had happened on that front. Or what if something happened to our prisoner, Ethan? My mind raced through every possibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We have a visitor.” He said allusively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. “A visitor that’s more of a problem than Allison?” I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you remember when we went to meet with the Witch, Sandra, at that diner?” He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I do...” I answered slowly, not liking where this was going. “Why?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She has returned. She’s in my office right now.” Leon said nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“When did she get here?” I asked through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“About an hour ago,” He said, and I knew he was nervous to tell me. “I thought you were still with Grace, and I didn’t want to bother you, but she told me you were done, which is why I came to find you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She told you it was over?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes “</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“God damn,” I muttered under my breath before saying, “Well okay, lead the way.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed Leon to his office, just a couple doors down, and I saw the witch sitting in a chair that was far too big for her. She still looked young, but not quite as young as she had the last time, but definitely still looked like a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Sandra,” I greeted her cooly. “What brings you here?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ran her hand through her hair, but she looked far less confident than she had the last time we met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I have important information for you.” She said simply, but she was lacking the confidence from before. She almost seemed afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What kind of important information?” I asked, narrowing my eyes at her as I took Leon’s usual chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I can unbind the girl you asked me about before. I have a way to break the restraints.” She said, but her voice shook as she said those words, and I felt like I was being played for a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growled angrily. “Last time I saw you, you told me you couldn’t help me, and then you left abruptly, disappearing without a trace.” I snapped at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sandra flinch at my words and looked frantic and serious all at once, her eyes darting around the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You have no idea, Alpha King Rhys, the gravity of this situation.” She pleaded with a little bit of bite in her voice now. “Things are so much more complicated than they seem.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you in trouble?” Leon asked her. Neither of us seemed to be able to get a good read on what was going on which made me a little anxious. The little witch seemed really on edge and we both were wondering if we should be too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I will be when I tell you what I need to.” She answered, her eyes flickering back and forth between Leon and I now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well then let’s hear it.” I snapped at her, ready to get this over with. I didn’t know what she was going to say, but I knew I would have to try and keep my wolf in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I can help unbind her...” The witch said before taking a deep breath and adding, “Because I’m the one who did it in the first place.”</p>
