                <p>By the time I finally made my way back to Grace’s bedside, I was exhausted. Every time I thought we were ‘through the worst of things’ life seemed to laugh at us and give us a new challenge. I didn’t want anymore challenges. I just wanted my happily ever after or whatever with Grace. But I had a feeling that was a long way off… Allison might be gone, but we still had the very real threat of Kinsley and Adrian. And I worried there was more to be worried about. Everything was happening so fast, I could barely keep track of all the incoming, threats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace,” I whispered. “Grace, can you wake up for me?” I pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I think she’ll be out a while,” Sawyer said tiredly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But she’s stable?” I asked for like the hundredth time. I had been mindlinking him pretty much non-stop since I had left several hours ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes,” Sawyer answered patiently. “But we won’t really know the extent of the damage until she wakes up.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But we don’t know when that will be?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No Rhys, I don’t know when that will be.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt like a child. My mate was hurt, and it was all my fault. I should have never allowed Allison to live... And I should have seen the trouble she was causing every time she came back when I brought a new bride... A part of me wondered if she had set any of them up with false evidence and I just fell for it every time without question because I just couldn’t get myself to care about them. She might not have been a part of all of them, but she almost definitely had here hand in some. The thing is... it never worked for her. I never once went back to her or led her on. I don’t know why she would have expected it work this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Have you heard from Leon?” I asked after I tried to mindlink him, but I hadn’t made contact for the 5th time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No...” Sawyer said slowly. “I tried to mindlink him awhile ago, but I never got a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed and leaned forward to rest my head on the bed. I had rarely ever felt so overwhelmed in my life. Even when my parents died, it was like it was just another thing that happened. I had dealt with many enemies in my time, but nothing like this had ever happened. Now, I found myself worried about Grace and Leon. I couldn’t get my mind to stop racing, but I needed it to stop. I needed it all to stop. Or at the very least slow down a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You should go rest Rhys,” Sawyer said after a while. He had gone to check on several other patients, but was now back, “It’s late.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No. I’m not leaving her again.” I responded simply. All I could do was stare at her. She looked so pale lying on the sterile white sheets. All the strength that she had gained in the past weeks seemed to be gone. I knew that wasn’t necessarily true, but it scared me, nonetheless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sawyer left the room again with a sigh, but when he came back, he had a plate of food and some water for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“At least eat something,” He advised as he placed them on the table next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m not hungry.” I answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She wouldn’t want you to not take care of yourself, Rhys. I wasn’t really asking.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes but grabbed the plate from him and began to eat. I hadn’t realized how hungry I was until I was actually eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So, what happened with Allison?” Sawyer asked trying to keep his voice casual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I got her to confess and then I fed her to the rogues.” I answered, not feeling the slightest bit guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You fed her to the rogues?” Sawyer frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yep. I gave her 30 seconds to run, and then I let them hunt her down.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Good riddance,” Sawyer gave me a slight smile. He was clearly tired too. I had been running him, Arlo and Leon all into the ground lately. I would have to be careful not to burn them out. We needed to solve our problems fast, so I could let them rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door drew both of our attention as Arlo walked in with a report sheet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What did you find at her house?” I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We found hundreds of wolf poison plants at Allison’s house. Far more than we expected. We have burned them all, and we are currently searching the house for anything else we should be aware of.” Arlo reported.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hundreds?” Sawyer whispered in shock. “I knew she was crazy, but I didn’t realize she was that crazy!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded in agreement. “Thank you for the update and let me know if anything else is found.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’ll be the first to know,” Arlo replied, heading back toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Arlo?” I called him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes, my king?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Did you see any proof that she has a job somewhere within the pack?” I questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No sir,” He answered. “I had one of the guards talk to neighbors to know if they knew anything, but they stated that they rarely saw her leave.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes in frustration. How could I have been so blind? I should have demanded proof of the job she wanted before ever letting her back in. Clearly her intentions were much more sinister. Were all those plants just for Grace or was there more to her whole plan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do we think she was working alone?” I asked before my thoughts could completely run wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Permission to speak freely?” Arlo asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Granted.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace seems to have many enemies. Each with their own agenda. It is very plausible that she was working with someone.” Arlo answered uneasily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Her enemies are my enemies,” I growled. “And they will regret messing with the Alpha King!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could say anything else, the door burst open, and Ethan came raging in, shouting, “WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO MY SISTER?”</p>
