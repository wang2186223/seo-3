                <p>Leon and I walked back to the packhouse in silence. I never really liked making plans about anything outside of my office, but if we hadn’t gone to the garden, I fear we would have fallen asleep a long time ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Is Grace okay after everything that happened?” Leon asked when we made it the stairs where we’d separate for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I mean, no. Not really. She was about as good as she can be. But I’m hoping that with a good night’s sleep, she will feel a bit better today. She’s worried I won’t accept her if she’s a Lycan, but I have no way to prove that I will until she’s unbound and becomes a Lycan.” I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Just keep being there and supporting her. She’ll come around.” Leon smiled. “I’m going to go sleep for a couple of hours as long as the girls let me, then I’ll be ready to work some more.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thanks. See ya later.” I said. I wanted to say something about Heather, but what could I say? It was my fault I let my brother’s behavior go on as long as it had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way upstairs, lost in my thoughts, but also exhausted. I knew I needed to talk to Grace, but a part of me wanted to sleep for a few more hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I opened the door to our room, I was surprised to see Grace was awake, sitting up in our bed, wrapped in a blanket, her fingers taping anxiously on the pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hi,” I said in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hi.” She said, looking up at me, and I hated that I could see the anxiety in her eyes. “Where were you? You’ve been gone a while.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry, love,” I kissed her forehead, kicked off my shoes and joined her in the bed. “I didn’t mean to be gone so long. I couldn’t sleep, so I went to talk to Arlo and then I went to see Ethan because I thought he might know something, and then I went to Leon because I needed to talk some things out, and we’ve been in the garden for the last few hours trying to come up with a plan.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You could have talked to me...” She said with a frown, so I leaned over and pecked her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s why I’m here now, my love.” I told her. “Because we have a lot to discuss. I’m sorry I didn’t realize you were awake yet. I would have come back sooner, if I had realized.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s fine,” She sighed, relaxing into my touch as I caressed her face. “What did you learn?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well, I suppose the biggest thing I need to tell you is we think we figured out part of Kinsley and Adrian’s plan. We discovered that you don’t have to be born to be a Lycan, all it takes is a bite, similar to vampires. We think they might be creating an army of Lycans.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh god, that’s a terrifying,” Grace gasped, burying her head into my shoulder. “If my pack was Lycan already though, where are they getting people from?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We were thinking about that too. Obviously, there are some werewolves who were among your pack, and since Adrian married in and they combined pack, I’m not sure if he was Lycan before or if he was changed and brought his whole pack to change.” I explained, choosing my words carefully. “We also think that might have been why they were in neutral territory yesterday. Perhaps they were trying to get new recruits.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are they giving new recruits a choice or are they just forcing it?” She asked quietly as she touched her neck in memory of what they had once taken from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m not sure, my love,” I whispered, feeling unsure as I took her hand in mine as we laid there just looking at each other. “I think that might be why they are so intent on getting you back... You’re a true Lycan. The newly created Lycans might be feeling resentful toward Adrian and Kinsley and would need a true leader, which would be you. You were born Lycan, and a leadership role of that sort would fit you perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No,” She said firmly, refusing to look at me. “I am not made to be a leader. I don’t even think I’m fit to be a Luna of any sort, let alone your Luna. No one in their right mind would want me to be a leader of any sort.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Gracie, you are beyond powerful. You have endured more than anyone should ever have to. You should embrace your strength and who you are.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up, taking me by surprise, and I sat up wondering what just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I am not meant to be a leader.” She repeated, her voice shaking with something I didn’t understand. “I’m going to get breakfast. I’ll see you later.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then she was gone. I sighed. I didn’t know what I had done wrong, but Leon and Sawyer’s past words of be patient with her were screaming at me and my wolf who was howling at the way she left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laid there for a while, waiting for her to come back, but she didn’t. So, I made my way down to the dining room, but she was long gone. I tried to ask if anyone had seen where she went, but no one seemed to know. I checked the garden because I knew it was her favorite place, but I didn’t see her there or any of her usual spots. I eventually mindlinked Sawyer to find her and keep an eye on things from a distance and made my way to my office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I attempted to get some work done for a while, every now and again dozing off at my desk. I kept checking in with Sawyer on Grace, but he said she was avoiding everyone and just sort of pacing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was finally deemed late enough for dinner, I made my way up to the floor I shared with Grace and Sawyer. I knew with her being in the mood she was in, she wouldn’t want to eat downstairs, and it was no surprise when she walked in with her plate in her hand, mumbling to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace? Are you alright?” I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She startled, looking up at me with wide eyes as her plate hit the counter and snapped right in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh.” She looked down and then at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Sorry, my love, I thought you realized I was here.” I told her as I got up to help with the mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart began to race when I noticed her hand was bleeding. I grabbed her hand in mine and began to ask, “Are you al-”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn’t finish my sentence as her hand began to heal itself immediately right before our eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up at me, stunned, and I knew I mirrored her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’ve never seen a wound heal like that.” I told her as I grabbed a piece of ceramic and cut my own hand, causing her to gasp, but I wasn’t worried as my skin began to close the same way hers had. “See? The healing is proof of your Alpha lineage, Grace. You are so much more than they ever wanted you to believe.”</p>
