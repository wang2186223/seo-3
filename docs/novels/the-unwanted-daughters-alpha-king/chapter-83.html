                <p>I sat in my office and waited for Allison to arrive. I had asked her to meet me once I had all of my ducks in a row and my plans were secured. If this didn’t lead to a confession, then I wasn’t sure what would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the picture of Grace that Heather had given me earlier today. It was of her smiling in the garden, her favorite place to be. Sawyer had run into her and asked her to surprise me with it. He hadn’t known that Grace was going to be nearly poisoned to death and in a coma when I received it, but I was glad to have it. It made me feel calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I carefully placed the frame in my desk drawer. I was sure if Grace knew what I was about to do, she wouldn’t necessarily be happy, but I knew she would be safer once Allison was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door pulled me out of my darkening thoughts, and I yelled for them to come in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rhys?” Allison’s sing-song voice called out. “You asked to see me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I did.” I beckoned her forward as I leaned against the desk and offered her a seat. “Do you want something to drink?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Sure,” She looked at me slightly apprehensively as I poured us both a glass of whiskey. I had rarely ever had allowed her in my office before, even when we were dating, so I could see how this was a little unsettling to her, but I knew soon enough she would fall into my trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I just wanted to check in with you. You had mentioned a few weeks ago that you got a new job, how is that going?” I pretended to care as I set down the whiskey glasses and sat down in my chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh,” She gave me a fake smile as she picked up her glass. “It’s wonderful. I’m so glad you gave me the opportunity to stay in the pack.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Of course,” I told her calmly, even though I was dying to just simply rip her head off. “We may not be together anymore, but I still want you to be happy.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Speaking of happy,” She took the bait and began to open up a little. “I worry that you are making a mistake with that new bride you brought back. I just don’t think she’s making you happy. You’ve been so stressed since I’ve been back.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“And you think it’s because of Grace?” I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well it appears that way,” She stated, shooting back her whole glass before walking over and straddling my lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her touch revolted me, but this was all a part of the plan. I just had to endure it for just a little while longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Let me remind you of how it feels to be taken care of by a real woman.” She breathed as began to kiss my neck and run her fingers over my skin the way I used to like from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Wait,” I said, wanting to stop this before it got too far out of hand. “I can’t… I can’t do this to Grace.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn’t stop though. “I don’t think you have to worry about that anymore.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What do you mean?” I asked dumbly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Don’t you want me?” She asked seductively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Of course,” I lied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Then it will be just our little secret. I knew you would regret that bitch and come back to me, so I took care of it for you. You don’t need to worry about it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Like with wolf poison?” I asked ready to make my move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes,” She answered before she even realized what she was admitting to. Her eyes grew wide when she realized I had played her as she attempted to scramble off my lap, but I held her wrist tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You attempted to kill my mate?” I demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She should be dead by now.” She pleaded desperately. “So now you can have me, isn’t that what you wanted?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“HOW DARE YOU ATTEMPT TO HARM MY MATE!” I shouted as I yanked her behind me, all but dragging her through the packhouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Please, Rhys I can explain! I love you!” She cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I was having none of it as I threw her into the car and made sure she couldn’t escape. She not just hurt Grace. She had tried to murder her in cold blood. There was no coming back from this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Where are we going, Rhys?” She asked timidly, but I didn’t bother giving her an answer. She would see soon enough what her fate was, and maybe then she would realize how bad she fucked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we reached the pack border, I yanked her from the car and threw her on the ground. I could see the rogues on the other side eagerly eying their fresh piece of meat and my own guards eying us wearily, ready to jump in if anyone crossed anymore lines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison looked around, noticing both the large group of guards nearby and hungry looking rogue, her eyes growing wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rhys, please,” She begged, gripping at my jeans in desperation. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to kill her. I made a mistake. Don’t do this!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You have 30 seconds,” I answered coldly. “I suggest you run.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave me one last desperate look and realized I was not going to change my mind, so she took off running. When her 30 seconds were up, I motioned to the rogues that she was all theirs, and they chased her down within no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her screams had no effect on me as they filled the air and echoed around the forest. I could see blood flying through the air, raining down on the rogues who were just gnawing on her limbs now that they had gotten pieces of her free. Others didn’t care if she was dead or alive, all they cared about was that she was a woman, and they could have their way with her. I couldn’t look away. Her screams eventually ceased, and I knew it was over even as the rogues continued to rip at her. I felt her death had come too quicky, but I hoped she felt a pain 10 times worse than whatever pain she had caused Grace to have. I held no remorse. I was the Alpha King for a reason, and as I said earlier, no one messes with my family and got away with it. Nobody messes with my mate and makes it out alive.</p>
