                <p>The room was bigger than I expected. There was a sitting area, and a mini kitchen, and on the other side of everything, his huge bed sat. I wasn’t sure if red was his favorite color or just the color he chose for his room, but there was a lot of red... Everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood nervously as he opened the door to his room back up and called in a servant by the name of Eloise. She was an older woman, but she had a kind face, at least I hoped she was kind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You called, my King?” She asked politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes. Run Grace a bath, please.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, and immediately moved toward what I assumed to be the bathroom. I couldn’t help but feel panicked inside. Did he want to bath with me? Was I ready for that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I will go to the other bathing chamber down the hall. When she’s done, come and draw mine up please.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eloise nodded again, and didn’t say another word. She filled the bath with all sorts of things that I didn’t know, and she laid out my pajamas for after. They looked new. They were red and silky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn’t start to undress until I heard the door shut behind her. I was very much looking forward to this bath. I felt filthy from being out in the garden all day, but really I just loved being able to feel clean. After a good portion of my life not being able to bathe regularly, I was excited to have this opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The water felt like heaven. I would have given anything to not move from it ever again. I laid my head back and enjoyed the feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I startled at the voice, forcing myself to look around to figure out where I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace, tap twice if you&#39;re okay in there.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly tapped, realizing I had fallen asleep in the bath, and that the Alpha King was back already. I wondered how long I had been asleep, and I wondered if he would be mad I took so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly washed up in the cool water and got out. I dried my hair with a towel, put on my new pajamas and walked out to the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Alpha King was sitting on the bed surrounded by papers, looking incredibly attractive. His hair was still wet, and his robe sat loosely on his shoulders, revealing his bare chest. I couldn’t help but be in awe of what I was seeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked like he left me space on the bed, but I hesitated. Was this really what he wanted? A wolfless, traitor girl?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He noticed my hesitancy and gestured for me to come to bed. I walked slowly over, but when I got to the bed, I froze, partially hoping he’d change his mind. Instead though, he just smirked. He looked amused at my hesitation, but I didn’t know what there was to be amused by. Then suddenly his arms were around my waist, and he was pulling me into the bed gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laid down uneasily and tossed and turned for a few minute before turning back to him. He was still very engaged to his papers, and I wondered what it was that he was possibly working on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The longer I laid there, the more I thought about the girls before me. Had they slept in this bed too? Had he rescued them the way he had me? When did he turn on them, and would it be the same for me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could lose my courage, I grabbed my chalkboard and started thinking about how to ask. I quickly drew a picture of a girl, then an arrow and then another girl with an X through her. I could see Alpha King Rhys staring over my shoulder as I drew once he heard the chalk against the board, but he waited till I was done before saying anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows furrowed as he looked on, and I fidgeted with my hands nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you asking about the girls before you?” He said after what seemed like an eternity. I nodded, still feeling hesitant about asking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So you’ve heard all the rumors then?” He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded again, not looking up from my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Gracie, you know I won’t hurt you, right?” He lifted my chin, so I was looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn’t know how to answer that. Did I believe he wouldn’t hurt me? I wanted to... But wanting to and doing are two different things. And he had a history....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Every girl before you, Grace, didn’t deserve to be by my side. They all just wanted me for the power. Each and every one of them either betrayed me, or wanted my status or my wealth. None of them wanted me for me. And I deserve to be wanted for me. I never loved any of them.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked away, unsure of what to make of that. Did that answer my question? Kind of. But how does one even betray the Alpha King?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace,” He brought my attention back to him. “Can I tell you something really important?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, and my stomach started to do little backflips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Me and my wolf think you might be our true mate... The way you make me feel... Well I’ve never felt anything like it. It’s like I want to burn the world down for you. I think I would do anything you ever asked of me. We can’t be sure because you don’t have a wolf, but Grace, you make me feel like no one else has ever made me feel before.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cheeks flushed at his words, and my insides felt like they were burning alive. What could a girl possibly say back to that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in, pulling me against his chest. I trembled nervously, but I also felt safe. My heart raced, but maybe this time it was in a good way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as quickly as I had felt safe, I didn’t. My head began to scream at me, the pain nearly unbearable. I was going to be sick as my vision went in and out.</p>
