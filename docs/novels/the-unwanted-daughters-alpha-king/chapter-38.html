                <p>“You want to give me an heir?” The Alpha King frowned as he read my board.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded at him, fidgeting under his scrutiny. The intensity of his gaze was enough to let anyone squirm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You want a baby?” He asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time I hesitated, but shrugged. No, not really, but what choice did I have? I needed to secure my place here, and the only way I could think of was to have the Alpha King’s baby. No one besides the child would be more valuable than the mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s a wild offer, Gracie, for someone who doesn’t actually want a baby.” He said finally, reading me like a book. “Where is this coming from?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no idea how to explain to him why I needed this. He didn’t seem happy about the proposition either. There was surprise, guilt and anger all in his expression which he was trying to mask and failing miserable at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed my board again trying to put my thoughts into words and pictures even though I had no idea how to convey them. Every single piece of me wanted to stay. But I didn’t know my purpose here. The Red Blood pack had been cruel, but I knew what to expect. I knew not to make a mistake, or I’d pay for it. I knew that beatings were a regular thing, and one day I was probably going to die by their hands. But nothing prepared me for quiet days. Living with Alpha King Rhys was unpredictable at best. I had no idea what to expect. I kept waiting for everyone to turn on me, but yet, I was in Alpha King Rhys’ office without explicit permission, and he hadn’t been angry to see me here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I want to stay, and you need an heir.” I wrote on the board finally, knowing that I couldn’t convey anything else that was racing through my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace, honey, you do not need to prostitute yourself out in order to stay.” Alpha King Rhys said after a long moment, staring straight through to my soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No?” I wrote and frowned in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Need to earn my keep.” I wrote out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Alpha King thought for a long moment. I wanted to run my hand through his chocolate brown hair, but I pushed that urge back down, waiting for his answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Gracie,” He asked finally. “Are you looking for a way to ensure that I can’t just kick you out when you think I am bored and tired of you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded slowly. That was exactly what I was afraid of. And I would have no place to go if that happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well first off,” He started in a matter-of-fact tone, “I would never do that. Second, I understand, that this is scary for you. However, you do not have to sell your body and give me a baby to stay. I also understand that you are in need of something to make you feel more comfortable about staying. And as I told you before, I am interested in you being my mate. I told you before we left for your old pack, you were my chosen mate. And I would still be interested in that if you are. For a year, we can live as companions, partners, chosen mates, whatever you want to call it. And after the year, if we have decided to choose each other, then you can bear my heir.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What if you find your mate?” I wrote on the board.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of amusement crossed his face. “Look, I have not found my mate in 10 years, Grace. Trust me, I’ve looked. And I’ve tried to have other women, and I’ve tried to get married before, but none of them have even compared to you, Gracie. I’m interested in you staying.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated. Everything he was saying sounded wonderful. I wanted that life he was offering to give me. But could I actually be that person for Alpha King Rhys? Was I brave enough to jump right in? Was I even good enough to be considered for this? Alpha King Rhys took my silence as a sign that I needed more convincing, so he started talking again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I promise in this year, Grace, that I will make sure you are well taken care of. That your needs are always met, even if I was to meet my mate or if you wanted to end things between us for whatever reason. I promise to protect you and teach you self-defense, so you don’t have to live in a constant state of fear. And we’ll continue searching for the one who marked you to the break the bond. And I vow to make sure you get a real education and teach you to read and write. I know that you are so smart and have so much potential. The way you communicate is amazing, and you’ve come so far in it, but you can do so much more Grace, and I want to help you get there. I want to give you the life you deserve.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It all sounded amazing. I wanted to believe in this. Was it worth the fallout if none of it came true? I mean, I had learned a lot already... He had made sure that I was with people who could help me... And he hadn’t let me down yet, and I had been here for a while now. He could have easily left me in enemy territory, but he didn’t. He was here. Standing in front of me. Not even mad that I was sitting in his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded at him slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So, you’ll stay?” He asked, his voice hopeful, which surprised me a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded again, feeling slightly uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“And you agree with our terms? Is it what you want?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded again, giving him a slight smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled at me, and I didn’t have any idea why he seemed so satisfied with himself, but I was more than just a little happy that I was able to stay now.</p>
