                <p>I knew I was in for it when my back hit the wall. His hands pinned me against it, and I felt my breath hitch with excitement and anticipation. I needed this. I needed him. I needed this, even though I knew I shouldn’t. Even though it was a bad idea. A really bad idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips met mine anyways. A gentle kiss that I couldn’t help but return. But it didn’t stay gentle. He deepened the kiss, and the urgency between us increased. I reached up, and pulled him even closer to me, entangling my fingers in his hair. There was no such thing as close enough. I needed him closer. His hands ran up and my sides, sending shivers down my spine. There was nothing I wouldn’t give this man right then and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then we were moving. He pulled me to the shower area, and turned it on, while only breaking our contact slightly, not that I let him go far before pulling him back to me. I pulled the hem of his shirt up and over him, revealing his glorious body underneath, and shuttered with anticipation. He took the opportunity of me being distracted to grow his claws and shred my tank top off of me. Under normal circumstances, I think I would have been scared, but in this moment, I found it hot as hell. I climbed immediately out of my leggings not wanting him to destroy those too and stood before the man in just my bra and underwear. I knew Alpha King Rhys probably liked a confident woman, but that was not me, and I didn’t know what to do next, so I took off my bra, slower this time and then he stopped me, pulling me into the now warm shower with him and lowered my underwear, all while never breaking eye contact with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands scaled my body, and I didn’t know how even breathe anymore. I was on sensory overload but in a good way for once. He spread my legs and kissed up them, alternating which one he was giving love to until he reached my private areas. No one had ever kissed me down there, but I thought I might passout from the amazing feeling. His tongue glided over my clit, teasing me for what I wanted. And just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore, he started to suck it in the most fabulous way. I was so close. Oh my god, this must be what heaven feels like!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I startled and looked around. I was still in the training room, and Alpha King Rhys was still holding me. None of it had been real... All a sick creation of my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you alright?” He asked, I could only assume, again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, my face flushing with embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Then why aren’t you moving?” He questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed but started to actually try now. The quicker I could move past that glorious fantasy, the better it would be for me. It wasn’t real even though it felt so freaking real. I was training so that I could protect myself better which meant I needed to be focused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After not being able to break out of the hold, Alpha King Rhys directed me to what I should do. Twist my arms and find the small gap of fingers and pull down as hard as I can. If I only being held by one arm, use it to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After an hour and a half, of breaking out of holds, and different sorts of binds, I was exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alright,” Alpha King Rhys sighed with just a little bit of sweat on his brow, unlike the very large amount of sweat dripping from mine. “I think that’s enough for today.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second the words were out of his mouth, I bolted out of there. I couldn’t be around him right now. Not after such a vivid fantasy. No, I needed to be alone right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I threw open the door to the top level of the packhouse, not slowing down. I refused. Not till I was safely in my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hey Grace, where’s the fire?” Sawyer teased as I ran by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn’t acknowledge him. I couldn’t. No. I needed a shower. Wait, no I couldn’t shower. Not after all the dirty things I had imagined in the shower. No. I needed a bath. Yea, a nice hot bath to soothe my racing thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace?” He called out this time in concern, but I was already to my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My bath was enough to help settle me down, but Alpha King Rhys was in the room waiting for me when I walked out. I was glad I had brought clothes into the bathroom because I wasn’t sure what I would have done otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You know Grace, I know you were aroused at the gym, I could smell it. It’s nothing to fear. You probably reacted so strongly because you’ve never really experienced intimacy before.” He said calmly, not really looking up from whatever he was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cheeks heated again immediately, and I had no response for that. What was I to say? I was daydreaming of you touching me in all the ways you never will? Goddess, this was mortifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Now, I respect your wishes, Gracie.” He said sternly, “But I don’t want anyone else to touch you for the next year. Are we clear?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, solemnly, afraid he would annul our agreement if I didn’t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Good. Now I have some work to do. I’ll be in the office if you need anything.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded again, unsure what to do with my new free time. I ate lunch by myself with the pack, and did some studying with Alana in between her chores, and suddenly day became night, and I had been lost to time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said goodbye to Alana and made my way back upstairs with my dinner place. After the bit of a crazy day, I didn’t feel like being around a lot of the pack. I just wanted to be alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, to my surprise, Sawyer had the same idea and came up with his plate about 5 minutes later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you okay, Grace?” He asked after we had been sitting in silence for about 10 minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and tried to act as normal as possible, even though my mind was reeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You look troubled... Is my brother giving you a hard time?” He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head no, but stood up, aware of my abruptness. I rinsed my dish in the sink, and quickly signed goodnight, before disappearing to my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crawled into bed with aching muscles and a racing mind. I was nearly asleep when Alpha King Rhys came in and crawled in bed beside me, tugging me close to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I only want you, Grace.” He whispered as he gently stroked my hair and kissed my cheek. “And I hope I’m the only one you want too.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn’t have a response, but the moment was ours. It felt right. Like we had laid in this bed, just like this, a million times before. And I drifted off into a peaceful sleep.</p>
