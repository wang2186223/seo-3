                <p>“I didn’t become the Alpha King by being weak,” I replied to Ethan’s side comment as Grace began to spiral again. “Sometimes, people need to be reminded of who’s in charge and who’s not to be messed with.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew my words wouldn’t ease Grace’s fear, but there was truth in my words. I wanted her to accept me for everything I was: the good the bad and the ugly. I was the Alpha King. I was known for being cruel, and Grace knew this. And one day, I hoped she’d grow to accept me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace was quiet the rest of the way home, and I let her sit with her thoughts. As much as I wanted to talk to her, Ethan was annoying me. So, the quicker we could get away from him, the better. It’s not like he had even really done anything, but his existence was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I have some work to finish when we get to the packhouse, do you want to come with me?” I asked Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately felt her panic at thought of being separated, and it made me feel slightly better. It was nice to know that even if she was slightly afraid of who I really was, being separated from me was worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’ll go where you go.” She said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I can stay with you, if you want to get some rest, I mean,” Ethan offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace stiffened slightly and shrunk into me slightly. I pulled her into me tighter as she told Ethan, “No thank you, I just want to be with Rhys right now.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan seemed slightly put off, but he smiled at her anyway. “I get it, just let me know if you change your mind.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded as we entered the house. Ethan headed to his own room, and Grace and I headed up to the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was early in the morning, and I was exhausted, but I did have a little bit of work to do. Grace and I could rest all day if I finished what I needed to, I wouldn’t have to stress or rush back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got to the office, Grace immediately curled up in one of the larger chairs I kept in the corners. I went to the closet and pulled out a blanket for her, tucking it around her. I started to work, but despite what I thought would happen, she did not fall asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you are alright?” I asked when I noticed she was just staring at the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m fine,” She answered a little too quickly, and then refused to look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace,” I dragged her name out, “Tell me what’s wrong.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, but finally reluctantly told me, “My stomach hurts. It just feels tight, but it’s nothing to worry about.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. “Point to where it hurts?” I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gracie pointed lower abdomen, which I thought was weird for stomach pain. I quickly mindlinked Sawyer asking if lower abdomen pain was something I was supposed to be worried about. But then I smelt it, she was bleeding ever so slightly, and I felt really dumb, and told Sawyer not to worry about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh babe,” I said as I pulled her onto my lap. “Did you start your period?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face immediately flushed. “I don’t know.” She stuttered. “I just don’t really feel well.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn’t know? Had she never had a period before? I mean, it made sense, I guess. She had never been properly cared for or had proper nourishment. She had been severely underweight when she had arrived here, and I knew all of these things tended to have an effect on the body. It was also possible that the wolf poison and her heart stopping could have had some weird sort of effect on her causing it to randomly start. She had been getting healthier until this most recent skirt with death...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately called Alana to bring so painkillers to our bedroom and I helped Grace up and back to our room. I immediately started the shower, so I could help her clean up. When we were done, I guided her back to the bed before dimming the lights and turning on some calming music. She took the pain meds that Alana had left on the side table for her, and I climbed into bed and began to massage her abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh that feels nice.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Good. Don’t worry about anything baby, I’m going to take good care of you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel her pain through the bond, slowly start to diminish. And even though I was exhausted, I found myself slowly starting to want more. But not only that, I wanted to give her more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised her shirt carefully and on top rubbing her tummy, I began to pepper it with kisses. I left a trail of them right up to her bra, and then did the same thing, stopping just above her shorts line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh.” Grace said in surprise at the gentle teasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you want me to stop?” I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No,” She breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tugged her boob out of her bra and nipped at her nipple before peppering her with kisses again before doing the same thing to the other side. I started to make my way back down again, but when I started to try and remove her shorts, she stopped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s wrong?” I asked, not stopping my assault of kisses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m dirty down there,” She whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved so I was raised above her, but looking her in the eyes. “You are a wonderful woman who has been given nature’s gift today, there is nothing dirty about that. You are beautiful, and I want you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re sure?” She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn’t bother with a response; I just simply began to remove her pants. Today was not about me. I would make her feel wonderful. I kissed the inside of her thighs and I could tell she was as horny as I was and ready for me. I lined myself up at her entrance and began to thrust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh.” She moaned. “Oh, yes, Rhys.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I increased my pace and I made sure I was giving her clit as much stimulation as I could. I was so close, but I needed to hang on a little longer for her. She began matching my thrusts, and I could tell she was close too.</p>
