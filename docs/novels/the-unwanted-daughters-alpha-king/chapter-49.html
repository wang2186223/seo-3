                <p>I watched Grace’s reaction closely. I didn’t want her to overdo it, especially since she just scared the life out of me. I had thought it was a delayed reaction to breaking the bond, or maybe the bond wasn’t broken, but Sawyer seemed pretty sure that it was just the side effects of me marking her. Her sense just seemed to be more alert, and he didn’t think it was anything to be worried about at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just kept looking back and forth at the two of us as if he could figure out exactly what had happened since I left his clinic two days ago. When Grace had been passed out, I had mindlinked him several times, and he had even come in to take her vitals several times, but we didn’t talk about what had actually gone down, and I definitely didn’t tell him he was right even though he and Leon had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, I wasn’t sure this was a good idea after the day Grace had had, but I didn’t want there to be any more big secrets or things between us. We needed to start our mateship off on a good note, and this was an important part of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clung on to my arm as I approached her. I was thrilled to finally be able to touch her now that Sawyer had finished his exam. But honestly, I was just happy to be able to touch her at all. A few days ago, I wouldn’t have dreamed this was possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I longed to hear her voice again as I awaited her answer, but I wouldn’t rush anything. The fact that she had even said anything was a miracle, but then she surprised me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why?” She asked, her voice soft, and my heart fluttered. I smirked at the shock on Sawyer’s face. I hadn’t told anyone that she was starting to speak again, but I figured it would be slow going, but she was already far farther along than I expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Because I don’t think he’s lying,” I told her honestly, rubbing her hand with my thumb. “I think it will help you to embrace your identity and power once we finally break through the bonds.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’ll go, but I still don’t want to undo the binds.” She argued as we started walking out the door and back to the packhouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why?” I asked, not quite understanding what she was so afraid of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well, unbinding will hurt. Probably even more than marking. I don’t understand why you are trying so hard to turn me into a monster!” There was a bit of hysteria in her voice now, and I felt a little bad for pushing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Gracie, honey, just because you’re different, doesn’t make you a monster. But I would feel this way about you even if you were a monster.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn’t say anything, but her grip on my hand tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace?” I tried again, but she didn’t respond, so I continued. “Your feelings are valid, and I understand that you are scared, but I’m proud of you for doing this.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once we got to my office, and I pulled her chair over next to mine, I mindlinked Leon to bring Ethan to my office. Grace and I sat in silence until the familiar knock that meant Leon was here disturbed us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated halfway across the room and wondered again if this was the right choice. I looked back at Grace, who motioned for me to go open the door, but her face was masked with a look of perfect indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thank you for meeting with us.” I said, not opening the door all the way yet. I wanted to know what Ethan thought exactly, I had told Leon not to tell him anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“As if I had a choice,” Ethan huffed as I opened the door fully, revealing Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace,” He whispered in surprise too low for her to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this moment, I could see bits of Grace in his mannerisms, and her in his. I hadn’t quite realized how similar they both were, but now they were both here, and both nervous, and it was obvious that they were related.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gestured for him to come fully into the office, and he took the seat across from her, his fingers digging into his skin as if he was trying to convince himself this was real, similarly to the way Grace was digging into the arms of her chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace, my love,” I said as I placed my hands on her shoulders for comfort as I stood behind her. “This is Ethan. Ethan, this is Grace.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s so good to finally meet you, Grace,” Ethan gushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace nodded her acknowledgment, but didn’t say anything. I could feel through our bond that she was feeling overwhelmed by all this, but her face didn’t change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You don’t remember me, do you?” He asked, studying her. This was the most alive I had seen the guy. It was like he was a little ball of energy, and Grace was peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace shook her head no, and I was saddened to know she was resorting to not talking again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I didn’t really expect you to.” Ethan told her earnestly. “We were separated long before we started creating conscious memories. I probably should be dead, but the person who cast me out, took pity on me, and secretly made sure I didn’t get killed by other rogues. I got lucky and the man who raised me came along pretty quickly and protected me. It took a while for us to piece everything together, but eventually we realized who I was, and I found out about you. Ever since I found out,  I have done my best to keep an eye on you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How did you find me?” Grace asked quietly after a long moment, finally gaining the courage to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Lycans can sense each other.” Ethan confirmed as though it was common sense. “And because you and I are twins, I can feel you pretty strongly, and to prove it, I know you were just newly marked by Alpha King Rhys.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace immediately shifted my hand on her shoulder to try and subtly cover her mark. I tapped into our bond and realized that she felt exposed and anxious by how much Ethan seemed to know about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You don’t need to hide it, Grace,” Ethan teased, not missing what had just happened. “I already know.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s enough,” Leon intervened before I had even thought about it. “You are here to answer the Luna’s questions and that is it. Another peep out of you that isn’t relevant, I will take you straight back to the dungeons!”</p>
