                <p>I turned around, so he could unhook my bra for me, and I was practically shaking with anticipation. There was no fear this time, only true sweet desire. I wasn’t sure but I think that this was what love felt like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands gently removed my bra, and when I reached for my underwear, he stopped me. “Let me.” He pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, and he knelt before me, slowly removing my underwear, and peppering my legs with kisses as he went. I stepped out of them, using him for balance, but then he didn’t stand up after. Instead, once again, peppering my legs with kisses all the way up to my clit. I startled slightly as he flicked it a couple times with his tongue, but continuing up my body with a slew of kisses. Some were long and drawn up and some were just little pecks, but I was so turned on it was hard not to squirm. As his mouth returned to mind, his hand began to rub my clit. I had never felt so good, and we were only just beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you like that, Gracie?” He breathed against my lips, and I suppressed a moan, but nodded my head slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed me back against the bed, and I allowed myself to plop onto it as he climbed over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re so wet for me, my Gracie. What a good girl.” He said in between kisses that were being littered among my side, and his hand didn’t stop moving over my clit. “Your body is so responsive because we were made for each other, Grace. There is no more proof than this moment right here, right now.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His dick was pressing into my leg, and he began to adjust himself to line up to my entrance. I didn’t know what to expect, I had never gone this far. I had never even really touched myself. This was new territory, and he was huge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I want to be inside you as you experience your first orgasm,” He said, kissing my face everywhere, but my lips. “Call me selfish, but I want to feel it. I want to be your cause. Are you ready?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn’t hesitate this time. I wasn’t nervous. I just wanted this feeling to continue forever. I felt his member press into me a little at a time. I knew he was trying to be gentle, since it was my first time, despite the fact that he was feeling impatient. He was large, but slowly he got deeper, and I suppressed every sound that tried to escape me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started to move in a faster rhythm as his mouth teased my nipples. I bit my tongue to stop myself from calling out, something that did not go unnoticed by my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s okay, mate,” He said slightly breathless. “Make all the noises you want. Stop biting that tongue and let it out. It’s all natural.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn’t know if I could do that, but the more he pounded into me, the less self-control I seemed to have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An “Ah,” Escaped my lips before I could stop it, and I swear if Rhys could have been any happier, he might have exploded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s right, my sweet, Gracie, let it out. I know you aren’t a true mute. You’re safe here, and I want you screaming my name as we orgasm together for the first time.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Ohh.” Another one escaped, god, I really was losing all forms of self-control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s it, baby,” Rhys coaxed, “So close.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the pressure in my lower abdomen building and I wasn’t sure how much more I could take when it happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rhys!” I screamed, my first real word in nearly a decade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s it, baby! Cum for me!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like nothing I had ever felt. The high I felt as Rhys stopped thrusting and we both just lived in ecstasy for a what felt like forever. His fingernails digging into my thighs, my hands, pulling at his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys’s hand caressed my face, and I closed my eyes for a moment, trying to catch my breath, as Rhys did the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“My mate,” He whispered after a long moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“My mate.” I whispered back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I like the sound of your voice,” He told me as he leaned down and kissed my lips again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, this was the polar opposite of what would have happened in my old pack if I had chosen to speak. I liked this option way better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys pulled out of my slowly, and then helped pulled me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Come on, Grace, let&#39;s get cleaned up in the bath.” He said gently. “How do you feel?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Perfect.” I whispered, still a little afraid to speak any louder than that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled at me as he climbed in the tub gracefully with me in his arms. He gently took the washcloth and began lathering up my whole body. There was nothing sexual in this moment like there had been just minutes ago, it was just comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just about done, when I started to feel different. My ears started to ring, and I felt dizzy. And there was this amazing smell, that I couldn’t figure out where it was coming from. It was like spring.  I just assumed this was an after sex, but Rhys seemed to notice my sudden onset of symptoms, and a worried look appeared on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s wrong, Grace?” He asked, his voice laced with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Nothing,” I said not wanting to cause trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You can’t lie to me, Gracie,” He said seriously, “I can literally feel you. I’m taking you to Sawyer. He stood up out of the bath and grabbed us both towels, and clothes. He seemed to need to do something, so I let him dress me like a doll, and I didn’t even complain when he carried me to the clinic, because the last thing I needed was to pass out and worry him even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s going on?” Sawyer asked, ushering us into an exam room when he saw us from his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She’s dizzy and there’s this awful ringing in her ears, and some sort of weird smell.” Rhys explained my symptoms before I even had the chance. This knowing each other&#39;s thoughts thing was a little creepy at times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You marked her?” He asked in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys nodded and Sawyer began his work up. But as I sort of suspected, there was nothing truly wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I think it was just part of the bond breaking with the person who initially marked her.” Sawyer said after making sure I wasn’t dying or anything. “And the weird smell is probably her just scenting you for the first time, your personal mate smell now that you’ve marked her.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and looked at Rhys. I might talk in front of him, but that didn’t mean I was ready to talk in front of others quite yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“And the bond is definitely broken with the other person?” Rhys asked, uncertainly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It appears that way.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How do you feel Grace?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m okay now.” I answered in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He studied me a moment before, nodding and saying, “Well, we’ve already had quite an eventful day, but what do you say we go and meet your brother?”</p>
