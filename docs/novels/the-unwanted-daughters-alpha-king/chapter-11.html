                <p>I woke up when the door creaked open. I reached out, but the other side of the bed was empty causing disappointment to flood through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh, sorry.” I heard Alana’s squeal. I opened my eyes to her backpedaling, but I put my hand up to stop her and waved her in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I didn’t realize you were still sleeping since the Alpha King left so early this morning.” She explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave her an it’s okay sign and moved to sit up, wrapping the blanket around me as I did. She came further into the room, a breakfast tray in hand. This time though, it had only a couple of new things that I had never eaten, and more of the things I ate the most of yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave her a small smile and took the tray. I couldn’t believe someone would have noticed what I liked and didn’t like. It was so weird to be noticed like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So, the Alpha King said he would be gone all day, and we were free to spend the day however you like. Is there anything special you’d like to do?” She asked with excitement in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. Was there anything I would like to do? I thought about it as my eyes fell on the chalkboard, the Alpha King kept insisting I use. My picture of the bird was still on it. What could I do to at least give myself the illusion of freedom. I would feel more confident if I knew my way around the house better. I grabbed my chalkboard between bites and drew a picture of a flower, hoping she’d understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squinted at it before smiling in understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“The garden?” She asked to make sure she was right. “You want to explore the garden?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded eagerly. I didn’t realize how much I wanted to until right now. Especially because I loved flowers. I always had. I grabbed the chalkboard back and started to draw again. I added a + and a picture of a house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“And the house?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded a little less enthusiastically, but still ready for a day that was completely my own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alana was also enthusiastic. I didn’t know if it was true, but she looked to be a little younger than I was, but I also knew my experience around others wasn’t very good, so my perception of everything seemed to be off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alana helped me pick a sundress that she said would, “bring out my eyes.” And she combed my hair for me, which was really nice, so I didn’t have to pull at my still very open wounds. I appreciated her and her kindness. I knew I was her job, but it was still kind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I enjoyed the garden for a lot of the afternoon. There were lots of spots that I thought were pretty magical. I could imagine coming out here to draw and paint, and just exist happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We spent almost the whole day outside in the sun. It was the longest I could ever remember being out in the sunshine. It was getting dark by the time I finally allowed us to go inside to explore the house. Alana chatted away, not caring that I didn’t talk back, and sometimes she’d ask me questions, and I’d draw it out or write in simple words to answer her questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house was beautiful. She showed me the kitchen where there were about 5 servants cooking dinner. I hadn’t really noticed that I missed lunch until Alana said, “It smells so good, I’m starving!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed a snack, one for her and one for me, and we continued on our way. I saw the dining area, the family area, and the game room. She also stated that there was an indoor pool on this floor as well, but it was closed right now, so we couldn’t go see it. There were only like 6 bathrooms on the first floor alone. Then we walked up to the second floor. This was where a lot of the people who worked here lived. Alana showed me her room. She had a hot pink accent wall, and posters of all different bands hanging everywhere. I couldn’t help but find a little bit of joy in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We made our way up to the third floor. This was where a lot of unmated pack members chose to live. Alana said that this floor gave off, “frat boy” vibes. She said they always had music playing, and they tended to take the party wherever they went. The 4th floor was where the Beta and Gamma lived. They had it separated into two separate living spaces, so we couldn’t go in, which I was okay with. I was really starting to tire out a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next floor required a password that Alana happened to know. She said if it wasn’t for me, she wouldn’t be allowed up here. Half of it was a bunch of offices for the Alpha King and his leadership team. There were multiple meeting rooms, and they even had a mini kitchen filled with snacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The final floor was the floor the alpha family lived on. It required another password to access. I had learned from Dr. Sonnett, that their parents had died fairly young, but all three brothers still lived there, even if I hadn’t met the other brother yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, I had gotten a room on the Alpha floor. I was a little unsettled by this, but it also felt reassuring to know that there was so much security, and that I was so close to the Alpha King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you want to go to dinner now?” Alana asked, once we were finished with our tour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, no. I was ready to go just lay down now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you want me to stay with you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I again, just shook my head. I didn’t want her to miss dinner on my account when I wasn’t hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay, well then have a good night, Gracie.” She smiled at me, and I tried to return it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the door closed behind her, I stood there for a moment, taking in the large family room and kitchen. It was all decorated exactly how you would imagine a mansion to be decorated. It was stunning but in a very prestigious way. It was all a lot to take in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hello.” A voice pulled me out of my head as I started to my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned and did a double take. The man looked nearly identical to the Alpha King. His hair was a little shorter, and he wore glasses, but the family resemblance was uncanny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I assume you are my brother’s new bride, Grace, yes?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded hesitantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m Caleb, his twin. I have heard sooo much about you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something in his voice that made me uncomfortable. I didn’t want to be talking to him anymore, so I turned to leave. He grabbed my arm, spinning me around back toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s the rush?” He asked, and I recognized that look in his eye. It was the same that Adrian had most of the time. The one a lot of men in my old pack had when they saw me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Let go.” A voice from behind me said dangerously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I breathed a sigh of relief as he let go, and I scurried behind the Alpha King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Touch her again, and your hand will be severed from your body.” The Alpha King threatened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Relax, brother,” Caleb smiled mischievously. “I was only welcoming your new bride. We are going to be family after all.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then winked at me, and I stifled a surprise gasp. My stomach twisted; I hated the way he was looking at me. The way he was eyeing me like I was something he could win. Like I was a prize or a piece of meat. It made me feel sick. I could also feel the tension radiating off the Alpha King. He was barely containing his fury, but whether it was at me or his brother I wasn’t sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Keep your hands to yourself, Caleb. We will not be sharing, and I will not be so kind that time.” There was a threat in his voice that surprised me. I wouldn’t have expected them to be on bad terms, but the way The Alpha King spoke to his brother made me think something had happened between them over a girl before. Maybe one of those many women Dr. Sonnett had been telling me about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace, let’s go.” His hard demanding tone drew me out of my thoughts immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let the Alpha King pull me away into a room that wasn’t the room I had been going to, but his words from last night rang back through my head. We would be sharing a room from now on, and I had no idea what to expect from that.</p>
