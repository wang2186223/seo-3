                <p>I was fuming as I made my way to the meeting room on the first floor. I should have known she would show up the second she found out that I had a new girl I was interested in. I was actually surprised that it took her this long too, since every other time she had been there within a few days of a girl arriving. I should have known, but I had been so caught up in Grace, that I had forgotten that I was the Alpha King, and I had to act like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rhys!” Allison squealed as I walked through the open doorway, and slammed the door shut. She was sitting on top of the desk with her feet on the chair like she owned the damn place. “I knew Sawyer was lying when he said you weren’t here. All you had to do was hear my name, and I knew you’d come running.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then proceeded to bare her unmarked neck at me, and I felt the anger inside rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What are you doing here, Allison?” I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I came to see you, of course,” She giggled, and I noticed she was wearing a short black skirt and red top that her boobs practically hung out of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I have no interest in seeing you.” I responded in irritation. “I have no interest in bein near you. I have no interest in you at all, Allison.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But we were once so close...” She pouted, sticking out her lip as if that would sway my feelings. “I killed my mate for you, darling. Don’t you remember?” She asked as she slid off the desk, her already short skirt rising as she did so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You did that for you, Allison. Not for me. Don’t confuse the two.” I stated coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn’t deter her though. She swayed her hips slightly as she moved toward me, trying to look sexy I would presume, but it only made me nauseous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Allison, I am not interested.” I tried again, taking a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a mere couple of feet away now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Stop!” I let my aura come out a bit. “I have already marked another woman. I am not interested in you or your games. That is enough!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She froze in shock for a moment, but I knew that this information would only keep her at bay for so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But you’ve never marked any of your fiancés before. You always said you didn’t feel the need to.” Allison stammered. I knew she was shocked, but I also knew she was probably already trying to come up with her next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“This time was different.” I replied cooly, increasing the distance between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well, it’s a mistake!” Allison shouted angrily, jealousy dripping from her voice. “You’ve made a big fucking mistake.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Think what you want.” I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a shaky breath before taking a step closer to me, and I frowned, that was not what I wanted to happen,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s okay, baby,” She said, her sultry voice back. “We can fix this. I can make this little problem you’ve created go away. Don’t worry.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“There is nothing to fix, Allison. I am committed to my mate, and if you go anywhere near her, you will regret it. Am I clear?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But Rhys,” She argued. “We have so much history. You’re going to just throw it all away on a girl you just met? I saved you from my family. I killed my mate for you. I did everything to make you happy, and it doesn’t mean anything to you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No.” I replied, irritation seeping through my voice that this wasn’t over yet. “It’s all ancient history. We didn’t work out. It’s over. It’s been over. I let you live. Now leave, before your pestering gets on my last nerve, and you get a consequence you don’t like.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Where’s Caleb?” She asked, looking around like he was just going to waltz right in here. “He’ll talk some sense into you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to head back upstairs, ignoring her. She had no business in what was going on between Caleb and me. I needed to go find Grace to apologize for the rude interruption we had, and I would make it up to her, picking back up where we left off. After talking and seeing Allison again, I was so glad I never went through mating or marriage with her or any of the past women. None of them even compared to Grace. Grace was made for me, and it was obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Wait!” Allison cried out, grabbing my arm and forcing me to turn back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her hand on my arm then back at her with a glare, and she immediately let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I found a job in the pack, and you know how much I need one,” It wasn’t a question, but she was making it sound like one, and I knew she as feigning helplessness, either hoping I’d tell her she didn’t have to work or that I’d tell her she could stay. “I intend to settle down now in the pack. I’m ready for that.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you?” I asked sarcastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I am.” She answered, not recognizing it. “Please. I won’t bother your new mate. I just want to meet her and stay.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No.” I answered flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What? Too afraid of what your people will think? Is she not presentable?” Allison provoked. “Regretting your choices already?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Of course not,” I growled. “She is perfect.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Then why can’t I meet her?” Allison prodded. “Just one time, and I’ll go live my little life in the pack.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes, but something about this felt off. Why on earth would she want to meet Grace? It didn’t make any sense. She was up to something, and I needed to know what it was. The timing of her returning was too weird.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You can stay.” I found myself saying reluctantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh, can she?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whirled around to see Sawyer and Grace standing in the doorway, Leon not far behind them, looking absolutely horrified by what I had just agreed to...</p>
