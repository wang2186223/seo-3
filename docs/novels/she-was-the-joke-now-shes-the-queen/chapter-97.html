                <p>At dawn the day before the international exhibition race, Austin tugged Brinley out of bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on. I&#39;m taking you to the hospital.&#34; His voice was still husky with sleep, smooth in a way that almost sounded indulgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blinking against the early light, Brinley pushed her tangled hair from her face. &#34;Didn&#39;t the doctor already say I&#39;m fine? I can grip the wheel without any problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held up her arm, the bandage wrapped around it thin and unobtrusive, flexing it to prove her point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of arguing, Austin draped a coat over her shoulders with practiced ease. &#34;I want you to have a check-up to ensure everything is fine,&#34; he said, tone low but commanding. &#34;Please, do as I say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight he put on those words made it clear there was no room for refusal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing she couldn&#39;t win this particular battle, Brinley sighed and dragged herself up to freshen up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slumped against the seat as the car hummed along the quiet morning roads, her voice tinged with annoyance. &#34;Do we really have to go through all this for such a small injury?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s fingers stilled briefly on the steering wheel before he cast her a steady glance.&#34;Your health comes before everything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The evenness of his tone wrapped around her like warmth seeping into chilled skin, silencing the protest on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they arrived, the private hospital greeted them with an almost sterile stillness, so hushed it seemed even a breath might echo. A doctor stood ready in the examination room, prepared before they even walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The evaluation was thorough, covering not only the state of her arm but every vital sign and bodily function.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a careful inspection, the doctor smiled with calm reassurance. &#34;Mrs. Moore is healing remarkably well. The wound has closed nicely, with no tendon or nerve damage. She&#39;ll be able to carry out daily activities without issue-and tomorrow&#39;s race won&#39;t be affected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief slipped from Brinley in a soft exhale. She was just about to say something, when Austin interjected,his voice edged with quiet persistence. &#34;Are you absolutely certain there won&#39;t be lingering effects? Any pain when she strains the arm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor offered a patient nod. &#34;After the stitches come out, she may feel a slight tightness. That&#39;s natural and temporary. A bit of ointment will ease it-nothing lasting, nothing to worry about.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the doctor&#39;s repeated reassurances, some of the tension in Austin&#39;s jaw finally eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive back passed in near silence, the quiet stretching heavy between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, Austin broke it. &#34;Tomorrow, a few retired champions will be on the track,&#34; he said evenly.&#34;And don&#39;t underestimate the younger racers-some of them are really impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked toward her, then back to the road. &#34;Don&#39;t push yourself too hard. Just keep it safe.Even if you don&#39;t place, no one will blame you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley curved her lips into a smile. &#34;Relax, I know my limits. I&#39;m treating it as a bit of fun. As long as I finish,I&#39;ll be satisfied. If I manage not to come in last, that&#39;s already a win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin gave a soft laugh, letting the matter drop without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley leaned back with.a casual air, her voice light. &#34;By the way, I heard Nightblade&#39;s showing up for the exhibition race?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s grip on the wheel faltered just slightly before he answered with practiced ease, &#34;That&#39;s what people are saying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, this is huge!&#34; she remarked, her feigned amazement carrying just the right edge of curiosity.&#34;lnhis prime, he was a force to reckon with. Too bad he vanished without warning. What do you think brings him back at this point?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes cut toward her, sharp and searching. &#34;You sound a little too intrigued.&#34; &#34;Well, he is a legend, after all.&#34; She turned her head to avoid his gaze, looking out the window.&#34;And honestly, your knowledge of racing has always felt... more than casual. Do you actually know him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow of a smile tugged at Austin&#39;s mouth, one that hinted at hidden meanings. &#34;Why don&#39;t you take a guess?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of giving her a straight answer, he deflected smoothly.&#34;Tell me this-what do you know about Rosara?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden shift hit her like a jolt. Brinley&#39;s pulse kicked hard, and her fingers clenched around the seatbelt,the strap biting against her palm as her breath quickened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slowly faced him, only to find his expression calm-as though mentioning Rosara meant nothing at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just... heard about her.&#34; She forced her voice into a casual rhythm. &#34;Rosara used to be one of the big names-she even went up against Nightblade. It&#39;s a shame she slipped away just as suddenly as he did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a short hesitation, she added, almost testing him, &#34;Doesn&#39;t it strike you as odd? They both retired around the same time, and now they&#39;re both stepping back into the spotlight together. Do you think...maybe they&#39;ve had some kind of connection?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s fingers idly traced the leather of the steering wheel while his eyes stayed on the traffic light glowing red ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car eased to a stop, he finally turned, his gaze steady and searching. &#34;Possibly. Two racers of that caliber might&#39;ve been close off the track. By the way, I can&#39;t help but notice that your racing skills are far from those of a beginner. On the simulator, your lines had the same precision-almost the same style-as Rosara&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s pulse gave a startled jump at his words, though she masked it with a light, practiced laugh.h?What a coincidence!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for the bottle of water on the console, twisting off the cap and taking a measured sip, using the motion to steady her nerves. Her gaze slid back to him, playful yet probing.&#34;Come to think of it, you sound awfully familiar with Nightblade. Don&#39;t tell me... you&#39;re actually him?&#34; The remark fell halfway between jest and suspicion, and she watched his expression with deliberate care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin arched one brow, started the engine, and eased the car into the morning traffic. His voice was maddeningly unreadable.&#34;Suppose I said | was?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heartbeat stumbled again, and she leaned forward, ready to push-but then his mouth curved in a sly,teasing smile. &#34;Too bad. I&#39;m not. I don&#39;t have that level of talent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light turned green, and the sleek Maybach glided seamlessly into the stream of cars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever tension had sparked between them dissolved into the steady hum of the engine,leaving the cabin deceptively calm.</p>
