            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re hopeless, Brinley!&#34; Brinley slapped her own cheeks in exasperation. &#34;What on earth was I thinking,actually wanting to kiss Austin again? Stop it! Don&#39;t even go there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, Austin had the kind of looks and physique that could make anyone&#39;s heart flutter, but she had no business letting such thoughts linger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her phone, resting on the edge of the bathtub, lit up with a notification.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a message from Colin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley, are you alright? I regret what happened before. I know it&#39;s far too late to be saying this now,but I need you to know l&#39;ve thought a lot about my mistakes. Even if you never want to read my messages again, I still have to say I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley stared at the screen for a moment before she turned off the screen, her face blank. She had no wish to see anything connected to Colin, let alone his hollow apology</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The harm had already been done; just saying he was  sorry could never mend it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley felt the exhaustion again, and the chill of the bathwater only deepened her dizziness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyelids grew heavy, and before she knew it, she had drifted into sleep in the tub.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her dream, she found herseIf reliving those two years with Colin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were back in the high-rise flat overlooking the river. Colin lounged on the sofa, but Milly was curled up in his arms, dressed in Brinley&#39;s nightgown,her smile coy as she snuggled against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Colin looked at Brinley was unlike anything she&#39;d seen before-cold,indifferent,almost cruel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley,&#34; he said softly, his voice strangely tender,&#34;I love Milly. She&#39;s the one who truly fitsme,body and soul.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ran a hand through Milly&#39;s hair, glaring at Brinley with disgust. &#34;That&#39;s why I never touched you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley gasped awake, jerking upright in the water,her hair dripping cold against her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took her a second to realize it had only been a dream. The first light of dawn was creeping through the window, the bathroom lamp throwing a weak glow across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still shaken from the dream, Brinley could feel her stomach twist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wrapping herself in a towel, she stepped out of the bathroom,heart still pounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes fell instinctively on the liquor cabinet in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden urge for a drink tugged at her-not to bury her sorrow, but to ease the sick feeling in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just pulled open the cabinet when a deep voice came from behind. &#34;Brinley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, she spun to find Austin leaning in the kitchen doorway, dressed in loungewear, dark circles under his eyes betraying a sleepless night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why aren&#39;t you in bed?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard some noise,&#34; Austin replied simply, his eyes flicking to the bottle in her hand. He turned to fetch two glasses from the cupboard. &#34;Want a drink?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley hesitated, then gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go to the rooftop,&#34; Austin suggested,taking the  bottle from her. &#34;The breeze will do you good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rooftop garden was alive with roses, their petals glistening faintly with dew. The early morning wind was damp and refreshing against the skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin uncorked the bottle, filling a glass for her and one for himself, though he didn&#39;t drink. He held his glass idly, eyes fixed on the skyline stretching out before them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley raised hers and downed it in a single gulp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rich taste hugged her tongue, its faint bitterness loosening the knot in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this about Colin?&#34; Austin asked suddenly, his voice wafting with the breeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at him, Brinley scowled. &#34;Do you honestly think I&#39;d drink myself silly over an ex?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; he replied with a shake of his head,a solemn expression on his face. &#34;I just think something&#39;s weighing on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spare me the questions,&#34; Brinley snapped, snatching the bottle from him and refilling her glass. &#34;If you&#39;re not up for keeping me company,you can just go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin said nothing as he watched her take another gulp. He simnply lifted his glass and drank with her in  silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the wine was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s cheeks glowed red, her eyes starting to wander unfocused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, she could handle her liquor, but drinking on an empty stomach left her tipsy far too quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Colin&#39;s a bastard!&#34; she blurted out, slurring as she swayed with the empty glass in her hand. &#34;And Milly&#39;s no better! Two shameless cheats!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin sat quietly and listened to her wvithout interruption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you!&#34; Brinley suddenly jabbed a finger at him,wobbling slightly. &#34;Austin, you&#39;re an idiot! Out of all the women you could have chosen, why on earth did you marry me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin studied her flushed face and clouded eyes,fully aware she was far too drunk to recall this later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at his lips, touched with helplessness but deepened wit tenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he spoke quietly. &#34;I&#39;ve wanted to marry you since l was fourteen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting her head slightly, Brinley peered at him and muttered incoherently, &#34;Huh? What was that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin knew she hadn&#39;t caught his words, but he continued anyway, voice low and wistful, &#34;When I was fourteen, at that party in the Moores&#39; house...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes drifted into the distance, as though seeing beyond the horizon. &#34;It was the anniversary of my mother&#39;s death. My siblings cornered me, calling me a curse, a bringer of misfortune...&#34;</p>
