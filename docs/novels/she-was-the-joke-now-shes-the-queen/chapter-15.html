                <p>Brinley tilted her head, curiosity flickering in her eyes.&#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s hand slid into hers, their fingers locking with practiced ease, as if they had rehearsed the gesture countless times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In front of your family,&#34; he murmured, his gaze dropping to her with a teasing spark, &#34;we&#39;ve got to look convincing. You wouldn&#39;t want your father getting the idea we can&#39;t stand each other,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her attention dropped to their linked hands. His palm was firm and warm, the rough edges of his calluses grazing her skin in a way that sent a quiet steadiness through her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She considered tugging free, but his low voice followed, calm and deliberate. &#34;Don&#39;t you want your father to feel at ease?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley exhaled hard and rolled her eyes, but she didn&#39;t pull away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, she decided there was no harm in letting him hold on. After all, it was hardly worth making a fuss over. Almost against her will, her fingertips brushed over the calluses in his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth of his skin surprised her-steady,grounding, almost pleasant. Her gaze lingered a moment longer; he looked effortlessly handsome,and even his hands carried a quiet strength she found hard to dismiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin caught the subtle motion, a flicker of amusement tugging at the corner of his lips, though he offered no comment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as they stepped into the entryway, a thunderous voice rolled from the courtyard, shaking the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Felix,you hear me? Run that race abroad and give it your best! Come back with a trophy-and drive safely!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her father&#39;s scolding made Brinley&#39;s lips curve into a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following the sound, she spotted Brandon standing beneath the leafy grape trellis, phone clutched to his ear,his heavy brows drawn together. &#34;Brinley&#39;s affairs aren&#39;t your problem,&#34; he barked into the receiver.&#34;Austin&#39;s the one taking care of her now, and he&#39;s a million times more reliable than you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix&#39;s muffled protests carried faintly through the receiver,but Brandon only snorted and snapped into the phone, &#34;And how exactly is Austin less reliable than you? Enough already! Keep running your mouth,and I&#39;ll cut your allowance right off!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He jabbed the button to end the call, then turned and spotted Brinley and Austin. His face instantly hardened into a mask of stern authority. &#34;Oh. You&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The act didn&#39;t even last three seconds. His expression softened, and he beckoned Brinley over with a gentle wave. &#34;Sweetheart,come here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin lingered nearby, quietly entertained by how quickly Brandon&#39;s demeanor shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley slipped forward and hooked her arm through Brandon&#39;s, flashing him a playful smile. &#34;Dad, were you yelling at Felix?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Serves him right,&#34; Brandon huffed, puffing up his chest. &#34;That reckless brat knows nothing but charging headfirst without thinking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he bent closer, lowering his voice to a hushed whisper. &#34;By the way,Felix wired you a hundred million.It&#39;s all yours to use however you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley was caught off guard. The next moment, her phone buzzed in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick glance confirmed her hunch-it was a transfer notification from Felix. His note read, &#34;Spend it however you want. If it&#39;s not enough, just tell me. And if Colin dares to bother you again, I&#39;ll fly back and wreck his company myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking her head, she typed back with helpless amusement, &#34;Got it. Focus on winning your race.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far away, Austin lingered quietly, taking in the warmth between Brinley and Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For all of Brandon&#39;s bluster and harsh words, the fondness in his eyes betrayed him every time he looked at Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching Brinley&#39;s unguarded smile, Austin felt his own lips curve before he could stop them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when Brandon finally turned to him did Austin step forward.With both hands, he offered the velvet gift box he&#39;d been holding. &#34;Mr. Shaw,this is my first visit. I brought a small token-please accept it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon accepted the gift without openingit,his gaze sweeping over Austin with deliberate authority.&#34;That&#39;s very kind of you. My daughter got a stubborn streak. If she gives you trouble, I hope you&#39;ll let it slide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words carried a veneer of courtesy, but beneath them lay the quiet concern of a father wondering how his son-in-law would treat his daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the Shaw family commanded respect,they still trailed behind the Moore family, whose influence stretched across both politics and business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With most people, Brandon might have been more affable,but when it came to the man who married his daughter,he preferred to probe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin dipped his head slightly, his voice steady with sincerity. &#34;Brinley&#39;s incredibly thoughtful. Having her as my wife makes me the lucky one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, he went on with quiet conviction,&#34;I know how deeply the Shaw family cherishes her.I&#39;ll make sure she&#39;s cared for, and I won&#39;t allow her to endure any grievances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His calm assurance struck the balance between deference and resolve, revealing respect for Brandon while making clear his own unwavering stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon studied him for a long moment, and when he found only sincerity in Austin&#39;s eyes, his stern expression softened into a rare smile. &#34;Good! Come inside-the food&#39;s already on the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clapping Austin warmly on the shoulder, he guided him toward the main hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trailing after them, Brinley noticed how deferential Austin looked beside her father, and an odd flutter stirred in her chest. A man who could dominate boardrooms and lead an empire was here showing such patience and courtesy,like any ordinary son-in-law intent on earning his father-in-law&#39;s approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the meal, Brandon struck up a conversation with Austin about business affairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin listened attentively, offering a handful of sharp,measured insights at just the right moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He carried himself with calm restraint, neither flaunting his knowledge nor bending too low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her seat at the side, Brinley lowered her gaze,watching his composed demeanor with a heart that grew increasingly complicated.</p>
