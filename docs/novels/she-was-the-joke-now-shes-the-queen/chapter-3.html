                <p>&#34;But later on,&#34; Colin continued in a hesitant voice, &#34;I came to realize Brinley isn&#39;t like Milly at all. She&#39;s softer,depends on me more, and... loves me in a way Milly never did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vance chuckled derisively. &#34;And with that realization,you still justify deceiving her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t deceive her!&#34; Colin&#39;s voice rose with sudden intensity before falling again into a whisper.&#34;I truly do care for her... it&#39;s just...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just what?&#34; Vance asked impatiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just that I can&#39;t seem to cut Milly off completely,&#34;Colin admitted, sounding torn. &#34;She was my first love.When she came back from abroad and reached out, I couldn&#39;t push her away. But at the same time,I didn&#39;t want to give up Brinley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you went as far as to forge a marriage certificate,letting Brinley believe the two of you were legally bound?&#34; The disgust was obvious in Vance&#39;s voice.&#34;Colin, that makes you nothing short of a scumbag.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin fell silent for a few seconds before answering with a bitter, self-mocking laugh, &#34;Yes, I&#39;m a scumbag. I want Milly&#39;s fire, Brinley&#39;s gentleness... I even let myself imagine how perfect it would be to keep them both in my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be delusional!&#34; Vance snapped. &#34;If Brinley ever found out about your double life, do you honestly think she&#39;d forgive you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She won&#39;t ever know,&#34; Colin said, interrupting Vance.&#34;She trusts me completely, never questions a thing.Even when she phoned while Milly and I were in bed,she was too oblivious to notice anything unusual.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words smashed Brinley&#39;s heart like a ruthless strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning, she walked soundlessly toward the elevator.Each step felt unreal, as though she were moving through a heavy fog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man she had loved for two whole years was nothing but a liar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley had no idea how she managed to return home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Absentmindedly, she unlocked the door, drifted into the kitchen, and began preparing dinner mechanically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At half-past six, the sound of a key turning in the lock reached her ears. Colin entered with his usual charm, carrying a fresh bouquet of lilies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m back.&#34; He leaned in and brushed her forehead with a kiss, smiling warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley forced her lips into a smile as she accepted the flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oblivious to her stiffness, Colin shrugged off his suit jacket and sniffed the air. &#34;Mmm, what did you make?Smells delicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your favorite. Grilled meat.&#34; Brinley turned away to place the bouquet into a vase, hiding her cold expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the entire meal, Brinley kept her eyes fixed on him, studying every gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Collin&#39;s phone never left the table, lying face down,and every so often he flicked his eyes at it, as though waiting for a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My head aches a little,&#34; Brinley muttered after dinner.&#34;Could you fetch me some medicine from upstairs?It&#39;s in the nightstand drawer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; Colin said immediately, springing up.&#34;You just rest here.&#34; The moment he was upstairs, Brinley snatched his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen came on, requiring a password.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried her own birthday, then their anniversary Neither unlockeed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to attempt again, a message notification flashed across the screen. &#34;Colin,wonderful news-I&#39;m pregnant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s fingers froze. The words blazed before her eyes,stabbing her like sharpened steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared in shock until Colin&#39;s footsteps began descending. Panicking, she dropped the phone back onto the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin returned with the pills and a glass of water.&#34;You don&#39;t look well. Do you want to lie down early?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley accepted the pills, pretended to swallow,then replied, &#34;I&#39;m fine. By the way... is there something going on at the office? You kept glancing at your phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Collin stiffened, but then he quickly composed himself. &#34;Yes, a project issue. I might need to head back later.&#34; &#34;Then go,&#34; Brinley said with a gentle smile, though her heart was breaking inside. &#34;Work always comes first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin slipped on his coat, pausing to kiss her cheek.&#34;Don&#39;t wait up for me. Get some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the door clicked shut behind him, Brinley&#39;s smile crumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears formed in her eyes, but she stubbornly tipped her head back, refusing to let them fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after a long struggle did she finally pick up her phone, her hand trembling, and dial a number she hadn&#39;t called in two years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, I&#39;ve decided. I&#39;ll return home... and I&#39;ll accept the marriage alliance you arranged.&#34;</p>
