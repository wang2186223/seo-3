                <p>Brinley inhaled deeply, steeling herself, then lifted her eyes to meet Austin&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze held a quiet expectancy, a faint tension flickering in it, like someone awaiting a verdict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Austin,&#34; she said, her voice quivering but steady. &#34;I&#39;m not ready to give you an answer yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow passed over Austin&#39;s eyes, but he nodded gently. &#34;That&#39;s fine.I can wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not what I mean,&#34; Brinley said, biting her lip as she summoned her courage. &#34;I realize l&#39;ve come to rely on you more than l expected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw a spark lit up in Austin&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,&#34; she continued, her cheeks flushing but her words resolute, &#34;I need a little time to see if my feelings for you might grow into something more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the words left her lips, a weight lifted from her chest. She ducked her head,too nervous to gauge his reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want me to give you some time, right?&#34; Austin&#39;s tone carried a trace of playful warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Brinley muttered, barely audible. &#34;But I can&#39;t promise l&#39;Il fall for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, then added, &#34;And if... if it doesn&#39;t work out, you have to let me go if I fall in love with someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart raced as she braced for his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would he think shewas asking too much? Would he be upset?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence hung in the air for a moment before Austin&#39;s soft chuckle, laced with affection, broke it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley,&#34; he said, his voice warm with amusement and a hint of frustration,&#34;Are you putting me on a trial run?&#34; Guilt pricked at her, but she straightened, her voice firm. &#34;What else can I do? You can&#39;t force love-it takes time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin didn&#39;t argue. HHe just looked at her, his gaze tender yet resolute, brimming with quiet determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, he simply murmured an assent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley snuck a glance at him, catching his gentle smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart skipped, and she quickly focused on her plate, pretending to be absorbed in her meal, though her senses were attuned to his every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside,the faint hum of summer cicadas filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s mind churned with nerves, uncertainty, and a flicker of excitement she wasn&#39;t ready to admit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole idea of trying to love him... it didn&#39;t seem so bad after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, the thought brought a small, involuntary smile to her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s smile widened as he noticed, his confidence growing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A trial period? He was confident he could turn it into a lifetime commitment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the rest of the meal, they steered clear of the topic, but a quiet warmth blossomed between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin casually served her food, and Brinley accepted it without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met now and then, sparking brief moments of connection-less awkward than before,but still charged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they left the private dining room, Austin drove her back to her office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soft music played in the car, and neither spoke for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s mind churned with questions, unable to fathom what was going through Austin&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t believe that Austin&#39;s kindness all this time was because he had feelings for her. Why her? When did his feelings start?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car rolled to a stop in front of her office building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brinley unbuckled her seatbelt, poised to step out, Austin&#39;s voice halted her. &#34;Brinley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned, brow furrowed.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze softened, and his tone became sincere. &#34;Whether you end up loving me or not, I&#39;ll make sure this trial shows you I&#39;m worth choosing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wordless, Brinley pushed open the door and hurried into the building, her ears burning with a quiet flush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From an upstairs window, she watched his car pull away, her hand pressed to her chest, feeling the steady thump of her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile crept onto her lips. She couldn&#39;t deny Austin&#39;s remarkable qualities, nor the stirrings she felt for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But love? She would proceed cautiously, determined to avoid the missteps she had made with Colin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Colin&#39;s frustration erupted as he stormed into his home, hurling his tablet onto the coffee table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen remained open on the project bid winning announcement page, the bold &#34;VantagePath Realty&#34;text piercing like daggers, burning into his reddened eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it! Brinley had wrestled another project from him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each defeat stung more sharply than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, he had dismissed it as luck or Austin&#39;s influence, but after reviewing her team&#39;s impeccable proposal, he had to concede-she had outdone him fair and square.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Another loss?&#34; Milly stepped out from the kitchen, a bowl of soup in hand, her white silk nightgown clinging to her slightly rounded belly. Her expression was filled with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin had cited her pregnancy to keep her from the bidding conference, and she, still grappling with unease over reporting Brinley for plagiarism, hadn&#39;t objected. He avoided her gaze, his voice flat. &#34;Brinley&#39;s proposal was better than mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The matter-of-fact admission cut into Milly like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing before him, she forced a sweet tone. &#34;Well, she&#39;s got Austin in her corner. That&#39;s why you lost.&#34;</p>
