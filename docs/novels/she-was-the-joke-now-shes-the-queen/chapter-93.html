                <p>By the time Brinley and Austin left dinner for the racetrack, the rain had already stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drove her to a city-center course,where beginners usually honed their skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new white car sat waiting in the corner of the pit lane. It wasn&#39;t built for speed or flair-just the kind of ride meant for learners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Want to give it a try?&#34; Austin asked, tossing a helmet toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley caught it, and the chill of the surface against her fingertips made her heart skip, though she couldn&#39;t explain why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She strolled up to the car, tugged the door open, and slid into the driver&#39;s seat, exaggerating her clumsy attempts to adjust it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed Austin lingering in the pit, his eyes fixed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she turned the key, the engine roared to life.Its low rumble was much softer than the race cars she had practiced with, perfectly suited for a beginner&#39;s car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Austin.&#34; Brinley rolled down her window, her voice exaggerated with excitement. &#34;Up for a race?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin gave her a look, half amused. &#34;What&#39;s on the line?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley leaned into the act, her tone childlike.&#34;Whoever loses has to buy the other dinner for a whole month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her act up, making sure she looked every bit the clueless beginner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin laughed under his breath and strolled toward a black race car. &#34;Fine. But let&#39;s sweeten the deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding into the driver&#39;s seat, he lowered his window and met her eyes, his voice calm. &#34;If I win, I want you to open your heart to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s heart pounded wildly, her fingers curling tightly around the wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glow of the streetlamp highlighted the contours of Austin&#39;s face, and as he stared at her, she realized he wasn&#39;t teasinng at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind carried the damp scent of rain across the track, tugging lightly at the strands of hair on Brinley&#39;s  forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered his attentive care over the past few days, how he always remembered her preferences and the quiet worry he showed when she was hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the little details she had ignored now slotted together like pieces of a puzzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just you wait-I&#39;ll win!&#34; Brinley declared, rolling up her window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The white car rumbled as it rolled onto the track.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her speed deliberately cautious, even hesitating on gear shifts to keep up the novice act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the rearview mirror, she noticed the black car trailing her at a careful half-car length-Austin matching her movements as if refusing to overtake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she crossed the finish line, Brinley hit the brakes,bringing the car to a smooth stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She removed her helmet, pulse still racing, and glanced at the black car that had crossed the line just ahead of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On that last corner, instinct had almost taken over.She&#39;d nearly slipped into her usual sharp cornering,but managed to hold back at the last second. Austin&#39;s car pulled up beside her. He stepped out,the wind tossing strands of hair across his forehead, a faint smile lingering on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked up to her window, leaning down until he could see her. &#34;I won.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The timer confirmed it. He&#39;d beaten her by three seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley found herself staring at his face, so close to hers,the light glinting in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Austin.&#34; She hesitated, then continued, &#34;Did you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to ask if he&#39;d seen through her act, if he had been holding back on purpose. But instead, the question that had been lodged in her chest slipped out. &#34;Why are you treating me this well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the same question, surfacing again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin watched her pout and couldn&#39;t help but chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached forward and pinched her cheek lightly,his touchimpossibly tender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice lowered, gentle yet firmn. &#34;I&#39;ll give you the answer when you really fall for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The evening breeze fluttered the edges of their clothes. Brinley stared at him, completely speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The honesty in his eyes didn&#39;t seem like an act, yet she still couldn&#39;t bring herself to fall for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the drive back, silence stretched between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley rested her head against the window, watching the blur of streets outside as an unfamiliar warmth filled her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe...letting herself fall for him wouldn&#39;t be such a terrible thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought had barely formed before she quickly suppressed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,she couldn&#39;t afford distractions, not with the race ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, when her eyes drifted sideways to Austin,intent on the road,her heartbeat faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was already nine o&#39;clock when they reached Hillcrest Villa, the darkness settling around it like a heavy cloak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A late-night snack awaited them, prepared by the butler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin took a bottle of red wine from the wine cabinet and poured a glass for Brinley &#34;Take it easy,&#34; he said lightly. &#34;You can&#39;t hold your liquor well. Don&#39;t end up flat on the table like last time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was one time!&#34; Brinley shot back, snatching up the glass and taking a bold sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cool wine slid down her throat, rich with a faint fruitiness, smoother than any red she&#39;d had before.Without thinking, she tipped back another half glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin didn&#39;t stop her. Instead,he served her food at an easy pace, eyes lingering on her as her cheeks bloomed with color. The sight quietly amused him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d had a few more drinks. The whole room swam before her eyes, and the glass wobbled dangerously in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She propped her chin on the table, staring straight at him like a lazy, satisfied cat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Austin.&#34; Brinley&#39;s voice came out low and husky.&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
