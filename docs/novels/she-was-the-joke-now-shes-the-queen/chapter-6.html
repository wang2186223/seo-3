                <p>Colin&#39;s gaze lingered on the stairwell until the sweep of Brinley&#39;s scarlet dress vanished from sight,leaving his chest painfully tight, as though gripped in an iron vice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories pressed in-two years of her quiet loyalty,her gentle temper, the way she&#39;d even defied her own family for his sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, when her eyes met his, there was nothing left but cold indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had gone so wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the shift in Colin&#39;s gaze, Milly nibbled her lower lip, her face still carrying that soft, demure facade. &#34;Colin, let&#39;s sit down over there. It&#39;s getting far too crowded.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin blinked, dragging himself from the fog of memory.His eyes flicked to Milly&#39;s rounded belly, then back to the empty stairway, before he finally forced his gaze away. &#34;Fine. Just watch your step.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before they could take a step, the heavy double doors of the banquet hall rattled with sudden commotion. The security guards stiffened and all the guests turned their heads expectantly toward the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wall of black suits cut straight through the buzzing hall, forcing the crowd to part.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At their head strode a man who radiated dominance,his tailored suit clinging perfectly to broad shoulders and a lean waist. His face was all hard lines and precision, his gaze deep and unyielding, carrying a weight that pressed down on the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Moore?&#34; The stunned whisper slipped out, and the entire banquet froze into a silence so deep a pin drop could have echoed on the marble floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition rippled through the guests. It was Austin Moore,the elusive and ruthless CEO of Moore Group -a man who commanded both fear and awe in boardrooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was quite unexpected that he would appear at the Knight family&#39;s charity gala.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never before had he attended trivial events like this.In the past,Moore Group sent only a senior executive as a formality. Austin himself avoided even major business summits, dismissing them as a waste of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps and murmurs slowly returned, hushed but fervent. &#34;My God, what on earth is Mr. Moore doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable... he never shows up to these things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it possible he came here because of Mrs. Knight&#39;s personal invitation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whispers grew into a quiet tide of speculation.Every pair of eyes was fixed on Austin, flled with curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several of the Knight family&#39;s members bustled forward, their smiles overly bright and eager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Moore, what an honor to have you with us tonight!&#34; one of them gushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin barely spared them a glance. His eyes were locked on the second-floor VIP lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in, his assistant murmured discreetly, &#34;Your wife is already upstairs with Mrs. Knight and the butler.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the nearby guests couldn&#39;t catch the words,they could read the tightening of Austin&#39;s jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of unease swept through the hall, and many heads turned toward the upper floor with silent sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Knight family had left the infamous Austin wajting at the hall while they entertained Brinley? That kind of slight was reckless. Everyone knew how merciless his temper could be, and the consequences would fall hard. As for Brinley... caught in the middle,her situation looked just as perilous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is about to get ugly,&#34; someone whispered nervously. &#34;Crossing Mr. Moore is practically suicide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs rippled through the crowd, and Milly&#39;s lashes lowered just enough to veil the flicker of gloating delight in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Brinley unwittingly provoked Austin, her lofty status wouldn&#39;t protect her-she&#39;d soon be kicked out of Bleron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, Milly brushed Colin&#39;s sleeve with delicate fingers, her voice soft with feigned frailty.&#34;Colin, my stomach feels a little uneasy...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin&#39;s eyes had been locked on the stairway,his mind racing for a way to shield Brinley. But Milly&#39;s plea snapped him back, his expression tightening with worry. &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Are you feeling worn out?Come,I&#39;ll take you to the lounge so you can rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm, it&#39;s just a little stifling in here...&#34; Milly sighed faintly, leaning into him as though the effort of standing was too much. Yet even as she did, her gaze slid toward the stairway, sly and taunting. A slight smile tugged at her mouth as the thought crossed her mind. As long as she was around,Brinley could damn well forget about ever getting near Colin again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew well enough that his heart hadn&#39;t let go of Brinley. But it didn&#39;t matter. His child growing within her was the chain that would bind Colin to her forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the past few months, Colin had showered her with affection, yet more than once she had overheard him breathing out &#34;Brinley&#34; in his sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood with painful clarity that although Brinley had once been her substitute, now it was Brinley who held Colin&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, that didn&#39;t trouble her. Her triumph lay in one thing only: becoming Colin&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin guided Milly toward the lounge with practiced care, his every gesture brimming with tenderness, as though he hadn&#39;t been the man drowning in heartbreak just minutes ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that same moment, a sharply dressed, middle-aged guest eased his way closer to Austin, eager to flatter him while twisting the knife toward Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He deliberately raised his voice, making sure the nearby guests could hear. &#34;Mr. Moore, you probably haven&#39;t been told, but the Knight family has been pouring all their attention on Miss Shaw tonight.The display was so extravagant, one might assume she was some exalted figure...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s eyes flicked over him, his tone smooth yet laced with ridicule. &#34;Oh? My wife sure knows how to stir things up,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remark made the man&#39;s mouth twitch, his features blanching in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin had just called Brinley his wife!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked as though he might try to explain, but Austin&#39;s bodyguards closed in with faces carved from stone, motioning him toward the exit. &#34;Sir, that&#39;s enough. Please come with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s complexion shifted from smug to pale.&#34;What in the world are you doing? I was trying to let Mr.Moore know...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Moore&#39;s business is not yours to discuss,&#34; one of the bodyguards cut him off, voice flat and frigid,leaving no room for negotiation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he tried to resist, two bodyguards seized him firmly by the arms and dragged him away, his protests quickly swallowed by the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The onlookers stiffened, a collective shudder running through them. No one dared to make another careless remark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin, however, didn&#39;t spare the man a glance. His eyes stayed locked on the second floor, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the VIP lounge above, Brinley sat opposite Thalia, their conversation flowing easily,smiles lighting the quiet room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a manager knocked lightly on the doorframe and announced, &#34;Mr. Moore has arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the words had even settled in the air, Austin was already striding in from behind, offering Thalia a polite nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s head lifted instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Austin&#39;s gaze locked with hers, and in that instant, the atmosphere seemed to turn still and weighty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the very first timne she had seen him since their marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the past three months, he had remained overseas,absent even on the day their registration was finalized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until now, her only impression of him came from glossy magazine covers flaunting his striking features and ruthless reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet here he stood, barely five steps away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sheer force of his presence pressed down on her,and without realizing it, she held her breath.</p>
