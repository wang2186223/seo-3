                <p>Brinley chose a beige dress that softened her usual businesslike image, one of the rare pieces in her wardrobe that wasn&#39;t designed for meetings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just wrapped up some work and came straight here. Did I keep you waiting?&#34; she asked in a gentle tone as she slid into the chair, her fingers lightly playing with the hem of her dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin shook his head and poured water into her glass. &#34;Not at all. I only got here a moment ago. How&#39;s the project going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been going smoothly-the government seems very pleased,&#34; Brinley said after taking a sip. A faint smile touched her lips. &#34;Honestly, if it weren&#39;t for your help, we might not have won the bid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dropped the praise deliberately, using it as a natural bridge toward what she truly wanted to discuss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loose ends still weighed on her mind, matters that needed to be sorted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin had been going out of his way for her lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His constant, considerate gestures left her more unsettled than grateful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Brinley even arrived, Austin had already ordered-a full spread of her favorite dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each plate looked like a tiy masterpiece set out neatly before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley lifted her knife and fork, selecting a crab, but her appetite was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin caught her distant gaze and gently placed a peeled shrimp onto her plate. &#34;Why aren&#39;t you eating?Try the shrimp here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley managed a small nod. &#34;Alrght.&#34; She lifted the shrimp to her lips, but though its sweetness touched her tongue, the taste never reached her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The private room sank into a heavy stillness, broken only by the faint drone of cicadas outside and the muffled tread of the waiter bringing more dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence pressed down on her until she exhaled sharply. &#34;Austin.&#34; She laid down her knife and fork, lacing her fingers together on the table, her face solemn. &#34;I need to thank you for your help in securing the project.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin lifted his eyes to her, his gaze warm yet steady. &#34;You are my wife. Whatever concerns you naturally concerns me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley gave a small shake of her head, her tone firm but earnest. &#34;That&#39;s not what I mean. WVe both know this is an arranged marriage, so you don&#39;t need to be so kind to me. Still, you look after my daily life and offer assistance whenever I find myself in trouble.&#34; Her eyes shone with a clear, almost stubborn intensity as she leaned toward him. &#34;Why are you treating me this well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question had haunted her far too long. For a man who had never been interested in women, Austin had carved out an exception-for her alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand stilled against the porcelain cup, and the shift in his expression was impossible to read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused before answering, &#34;So in your eyes, all this kindness must come with strings attached?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley gave a forthright nod. &#34;Of course. In our world, favors don&#39;t come free. We began with a deal, not romance. If there&#39;s a reason behind what you&#39;re doing, just lay it out. After everything you&#39;ve done for me,I&#39;m willing to grant your wish if I can. But I need to be clear...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words cut short when his fingertip flicked gently against her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t painful, but it carried the unmistakable feel of quiet reproach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s head jerked up, colliding with Austin&#39;s gaze, the corners of his mouth curved with quiet amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At some point, he had leaned closer, close enough that she caught the crisp scent of his cologne laced with a faint, unfamiliar sweetness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley.&#34; His voice was low, carrying a touch of frustration. &#34;What goes on in that mind of yours?&#34; &#34;L...&#34;&#39; Her pulse stumbled under the weight of his stare. Instinct pushed her to lean back, putting distance between them. &#34;I just don&#39;t want to end up indebted to anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if I told you I have no hidden agenda?&#34; Austin eased into his seat again, lifting his glass with deliberate calm. He took a slow sip, but his eyes remained fixed on her. &#34;What if the reason I treat you well is simply because I choose to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way!&#34; Brinley shot back without hesitation, her protest sharp, though her voice carried less conviction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s tone dropped, threaded with a warmth that was impossible to mistake. &#34;This isn&#39;t about gain. Every kindness l&#39;ve shown you is free of calculation.&#34; He held her gaze, steady and unyielding, and spoke with deliberate clarity. &#34;Brinley... I&#39;m in love with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind erupted in static, the world around her buzzing until she could barely hear her own breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rushed across her skin, painting her cheeks and climbing to the tips of her ears until even her earlobes burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she tried to form words, her throat betrayed her. She only sat there, stunned, her wide eyes locked on Austin in wvordless disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell? Had he really just said he loved her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words knocked the breath from her chest, leaving her stunned in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You... you can&#39;t be serious,&#34; Brinley stammered, panic flickering beneath her voice. &#34;Do you even know what you&#39;re saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean every word.&#34; Austin&#39;s steady gaze never wavered. &#34;What I feel for you isn&#39;t a passing fancy-it&#39;s real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated, searching her face, his words softening even more. &#34;I know this must feel abrupt. You don&#39;t need to say anything right now. All I want is for you to believe me-what I feel is real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence stretched between them, weighted with an undercurrent that made Brinley&#39;s chest tighten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dropped her gaze to the table, fingertips drifting over the embroidered patterns in the cloth, her pulse hammering faster with every passing second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What choice did she have? Reject him outright? Or...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brinley turned the thought over in her mind, flashes of the past weeks surfaced. Without realizingit,she had grown used to Austin&#39;s steady presence, to the way his care always seemed to reach her before she even asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When obstacles loomed, his face was the first that came to mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, after hearing his love confession, she realized her heart hadn&#39;t recoiled. There was no sense of revulsion, no urge to flee. Instead, something deep inside her softened, a fragile warmth unfurling in the silence between them.</p>
