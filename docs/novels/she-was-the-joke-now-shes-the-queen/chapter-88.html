                <p>With words that balanced firmness and tendernesS,Austin left Brinley blushing furiously, her heartbeat unsteady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to slip her hand away, but his grasp only tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Austin...&#34; Her voice wavered,betraying her fluster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer, only looked at her with a gaze layered in complicated,unspoken emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth of his palm against hers sent her heartbeat racing in bewilderment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her phone buzzed, slicing through the charged silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jensen&#39;s name lit the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley, are you okay?&#34; His voice came through, thick with guilt. &#34;This is on me. I never should&#39;ve let Bowman get near you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not your fault. I just wasn&#39;t careful enough.&#34;Brinley rushed to reassure him, her voice soft but firm.  &#34;How are things on your side? Miguel didn&#39;t give you any trouble, did he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jensen let out a small laugh, relief lacing his words.&#34;Not at all. Miguel was surprisingly helpful-he actually cleared things up for me. Oh, and Brinley,your car...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The car isn&#39;t important. What matters is that I&#39;m alright.&#34; Her reply was quick, almost cutting him off.&#34;Don&#39;t worry about me. I&#39;ll get in touch once I&#39;m discharged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, she lowered the phone toward the bedside table. Before it landed, Austin&#39;s words shattered the stillness. &#34;I&#39;m staying with you tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand froze mid-air. Snapping her head up, Brinley stared at him wide-eyed. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s tone held a calm certainty, as though stating a fact no one could contest. &#34;I said I&#39;m staying here tonight. With your arm like this, you&#39;ll need someone to help you with water, the bathroom, everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s reaction was instant. &#34;That&#39;s not necessary!&#34;she blurted,instinctively scooting deeper into the bed.&#34;There are nurses around, and I can take care of myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea unsettled her. Even if the mattress looked wide enough, the thought of squeezing two people onto it felt unthinkably awkward. But Austin seemed deaf to her protests. He strode to the wardrobe, pulled out a neatly folded set of pajamas, and held them up as proof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obviously, he&#39;d laid the plans well ahead of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See? I even brought clothes.&#34; His eyes carried a steel -edged resolve as he waved the pajamas. &#34;Don&#39;t fight me on this. You&#39;re injured. So for once, just listen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s voice sharpened with unease as she tried to push herself upright. &#34;Austin! This is a hospital, not our home.You can&#39;t just...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t just what?&#34; He arched a brow and leaned closer,his face hovering near hers with deliberate provocation. &#34;When I was in the hospital, you stayed by my side, didn&#39;t you? So why are you tryingto push me away when you need assistance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks heated, words tumbling out in protest.&#34;That&#39;s not the same at all! Back then, you insisted that you needed me around twenty-four seven,andI got dragged into it against my will!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin drew out his reply, eyes gleaming with playful mischief. &#34;Well, I have to say, you took excellent care of me. Now it&#39;s my turn to return the favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley was at a loss for words. She turned her head away,avoiding his gaze, and finally hissed,&#34;No matter  what, you&#39;re not sharing a bed with me. If you want to rest, take the sofa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Austin acted as if the sofa didn&#39;t exist. He settled onto the edge of her bed instead, slowly working open the buttons on his shirt cuffs. &#34;That thing&#39;s too soft. My back won&#39;t survive it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley blurted out, staring at him in disbelief,&#34;Since when do you have back problems?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered him at the gym not long ago,casually lifting weights heavier than the trainer&#39;s,without the slightest sign of strain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin tilted his head up, a crooked smirk tugging at his lips.&#34;Maybe I twisted it when I rushed over to save you this afternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mix of truth and exaggeration slipped neatly into her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of his frantic dash earlier left her throat tight, the words of refusal stuck fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way she was going to let him strain his back any further on her account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching her hesitation, Austin pressed in smoothly &#34;Just one night. Sleep without worry, and I swear l won&#39;t lay a hand on you.&#34; His tone was steady, his eyes carrying a disarming sincerity, leaving her momentarily stripped of arguments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With reluctant resolve, Brinley shifted deeper into the bed, carving out space for him. Her voice dropped to a fragile whisper. &#34;You&#39;d better keep that promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deal,&#34; he answered at once, though a flicker of smug satisfaction glinted in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After slipping into his pajamas,he eased himself down beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This hospital bed was wider than the standard ones-enough to leave a fist&#39;s breadth of space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Brinley couldn&#39;t shake the tension winding through her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every breath carried Austin&#39;s faint shampoo scent, his steady rhythm of breathing brushing against her ears,his warmth radiating across that narrow divide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each subtle trace of him teased her senses like feathers trailing over bare skin, stirring her restless heart and making sleep impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tense from head to toe, she dared not move, fearing the slightest turn would touch him. Time blurred into an anxious haze before Austin shifted without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s pulse kicked up, and she held still, barely allowing herself to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, she felt him shift closer, his warmth closing in, his breath fanning against her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; Her voice came out tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; Austin murmured, his tone heavy with drowsy ease. &#34;The bed shook a little-I thought you might roll off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This bed is solid. I&#39;m not about to tumble out,&#34; she countered,almost scoffing at his flimsy excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what if you did?&#34; Austin&#39;s voice lost its laziness,turning solemn. &#34;Your arm&#39;s injured. If you fall, you could seriously hurt it again. Staying close means I can keep you safe.&#34;</p>
