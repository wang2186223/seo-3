                <p>Brinley&#39;s eyes lingered on the sleek sports car.temptation tugging at her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Its raw power and precision far outclassed her current ride,and she knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But sliding behind that wheel would mean exposing just how much skill she&#39;d been hiding from Austin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll pass,&#34; she murmured at last, shaking her head &#34;With how I drive now, handling something like that would only get dangerous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin didn&#39;t argue. An easy smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. &#34;Fair enough. Keep practicing -I&#39;ll be right here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True to his word, he drifted toward the shade of a nearby awning, hands slipping into his pockets as he settled in to watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His calm gaze followed her car around the track,steady and unrelenting. That unwavering attention unsettled her, and more than once she nearly botched a turn. To mask it, she eased her speed, forcing herself to appear clumsy, an amateur testing her limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, the weight of his eyes-sharp, probing,impossible to fool-made her chest tighten. Her pulse quickened every time she thought of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After an hour of circling the track under that scrutiny,she couldn&#39;t stand it anymore. Brinley swung the car to a stop in front of Austin and pushed open the door.&#34;I&#39;m done. I just want to head back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin inclined his head, unbothered. &#34;Then I&#39;ll take you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly waved him off, forcing a casual tone. &#34;No need. I can manage on my own...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get in the car,&#34; Austin cut her off, his voice firm and final.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swung open the Maybach&#39;s door and shot her a look. &#34;You don&#39;t want tomorrow&#39;s headlines to read,&#39;Rising Real Estate Star Brinley Moore Caught Sneaking Around the Racetrack at Night,&#39; do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no choice, Brinley ducked inside and sank into the passenger seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Maybach slid smoothly away from the track, the hush inside the cabin pressing against her ears. She kept her eyes on the blur of neon lights rushing past the window, her thoughts tangled and restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t want me to see how you drive, do you?&#34;Austin&#39;s sudden question sliced through the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart gave a nervous jolt. &#34;That&#39;s not it,&#34; she insisted quickly. &#34;I just... don&#39;t like being watched.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin let out a low laugh, not bothering to argue.Steering effortlessly, he veered onto a narrow,deserted road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley frowned, confusion creeping in. &#34;This isn&#39;t the way back to Hillcrest Villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34; His mouth curved faintly as he kept his eyes on the road. &#34;I&#39;m taking you somewhere else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, the car rolled to a stop outside a warehouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin stepped out,pushed open the heavy door,and revealed a compact racing simulator room gleaming inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s eyes widened at the unexpected sight.&#34;What is this place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A little spot I use for practice,&#34; Austin said,casually lifting two helmets and offering one to her. &#34;Want to  try it out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pulse quickened as she took in the setup. She knew how advanced these simulators were-down to the subtle grip of the tires and the roar of the engine,they mirrored the real track almost flawlessly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter? Feeling nervous?&#34; Austin pressed,one brow raised, his voice tinged with a teasing challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That spark of competitiveness in her ignited. She snatched the helmet from his hand, fastening the strap with determination. &#34;Afraid? Not a chance.Let&#39;s see what you&#39;ve got.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding into their seats, the two pulled on their headphones. A moment later, the massive screen in front of them came alive, projecting the curves and straightaways of a very familiar course-none other than the track where the upcoming exhibition race would be held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The rules are simple. Three laps is all it takes. The one who finishes in less time gets the victory.&#34;Austin&#39;s voice came through Brinley&#39;s headphones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fine by me!&#34; Brinley replied, her fingers tightening around the wheel as she drew in a steadying breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp crack of the virtual starter&#39;s pistol sent both posed cars rocketing forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Brinley deliberately held back, keeping her pace clumsy, the picture of a cautious novice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as Austin&#39;s car pulled farther ahead, her pride burned hotter than her restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stomped the accelerator, body jolting with the surge as she steered with sharp, precise turns. Her car darted through the track with effortless agility, cutting corners tighter and gaining speed with every lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the skills she had tried so hard to bury spilled out in a rush, her instincts seizing the wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her car shot across the finish line, realization slammed into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it. She&#39;d just exposed herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yanked off her helmet, chest heaving as she sucked in air, her gaze snapping toward Austin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slid his own helmet free, an amused glint in his eyes. &#34;Well now, my dear, you&#39;re far from the clumsy driver you claimed to be-you&#39;re actually quite skilled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s pulse hammered in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She realized her flawless performance had betrayed too much, and Austin&#39;s suspicions about her had only  deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34; Words caught on her tongue, leaving her stranded in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin didn&#39;t push, instead allowing a sly smile to tug at his lips. &#34;That exhibition race should be quite the spectacle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liftinghimself from the chair, he crossed to the window and fixed his gaze on the star-scattered night.&#34;I&#39;ve always been curious about what prompted you to sign up for it so suddenly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley hesitated, then drifted to his side, her voice quiet but steady. &#34;I just wanted to push myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that really it?&#34; Austin turned, eyes piercing straight into hers. &#34;Funny-I remember you once claimed it was nothing more than a hobby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her chin, trying to mask the heat rising to her cheeks. &#34;So what? What&#39;s wrong with me pursuing my hobby and participating in an exhibition race?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s mouth curved in silence, his gaze shifting back to the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers idly drummed the window frame, though the faint gleam of curiosity in his eyes betrayed his thoughts. What else was Brinley hiding behind that calm facade?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her driving style echoed the mysterious Rosara in too many ways, yet her nervousness didn&#39;t feel staged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two of them fell silent, and the air between them thickened, filled with a quiet, unspoken tension.</p>
