                <p>Brinley swiped through her tablet, checking the track for the upcoming exhibition race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Moore?&#34; The construction foreman&#39;s voice broke her focus. &#34;The workers said they need to adjust the slope. Do you want to double-check?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapped back to the moment, Brinley quickly flipped her tablet face down on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just sent you the measurements. Make sure to stck to them.&#34; Her voice was strained, betraying her effort to stay composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; the foreman replied, oblivious to her unease, and turned to relay the instructions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alone under the canopy, Brinley lifted her tablet again, the screen still open to the race invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her finger lingered over the &#34;Reply&#34; button, wavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should she go?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attending meant slipping back into her racing suit, grasping the steering wheel, and possibly facing Austin&#39;s probing gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Skipping it felt like turning her back on the spark reigniting within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she saw the invitation, her long-dormant passion for racing roared back to life, as vivid as it had been years ago at the starting line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wouldn&#39;t sacrifice that fire-not for anyone, not for the illusion of stability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, Brinley tapped the screen, typing. &#34;I&#39;m in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, when she was back at the villa, the butler had dinner ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin hadn&#39;t returned yet. Brinley sat at te dining table, picking at her food, her thoughts consumed by the race. She needed to rebuild her skills-stamina, reflexes, the instinct for handling a car. Every piece had to be reclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After her shower, she slid into bed, pulling the covers over her as she opened her tablet to the racing simulator she hadn&#39;t touched in years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The familiar interface sparked a rush of emotion, causing her eyes to well up with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A virtual red racecar waited at the starting line, the name &#34;Rosara&#34; gleaming on its side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engine&#39;s low hum stirred her muscle memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s fingers danced across the virtual controls-turning, accelerating, overtaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her first lap was sluggish, a full ten seconds off her best times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gritting her teeth, she practiced until 2 a.m., finally hitting a consistent lap time within her goal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exiting the app, she erased her browsing history and tucked the tablet into the nightstand drawer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slipping out of bed for water, she froze at the bedroom door, spotting Austin at the end of the hall in loungewear,holding a glass of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t sleep?&#34; His voice cut through the stillness, clear and calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s pulse spiked. She stretched, feigning grogginess. &#34;No, a bit thirsty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin approached, offering her the glass of water. &#34;Is the project stressing you out? You seem exhausted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lingered on her slightly reddened ones, concern flickering in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, just a bit busy,&#34; Brinley said, taking the glass. &#34;Why are you awake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was sorting some documents.&#34; Austin studied her for a moment. &#34;I heard noises from your room earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley sipped the water, forcing calm. &#34;It was probably the wind rattling the window. I slept pretty soundly,so I didn&#39;t hear anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Austin&#39;s brow arched, but he didn&#39;t push. He just brushed a strand of hair from her forehead.&#34;You can go back to sleep. If the project is too much to handle, let Miguel pull a team together to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got it handled,&#34; Brinley said, avoiding his eyes as she turned back to her room. &#34;I&#39;m heading to bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley,&#34; Austin called softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced back, her heart pounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If something&#39;s weighing on you, I&#39;m here,&#34; he said gently. &#34;You don&#39;t have to carry it alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded silently and hurried into her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the days that followed, Brinley led a double life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By day, she was the sharp, efficient project leader-checking data on-site, negotiating with vendors in boardrooms, and charming contacts at social gatherings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By night, she trained in secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At 5:30 a.m., before the sky lightened, she slipped into the gym, running intervals on the treadmill and powering through core workouts, her clothes drenched with sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At 11 p.m., after Austin was asleep, she locked herself in her bedroom, honing her skills on the simulator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One morning, as she crept back from training, she found Austin on the sofa, holding her fitness tracker, its screen still displaying her recent workout stats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where were you?&#34; His voice, rough from sleep, carried a quiet intensity as his eyes scanned her sweat-soaked gym clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s heart raced, her mind scrambling. &#34;Just did some stretches in the gym. Too much desk time makes my back ache.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin said nothing for a long moment, setting the tracker down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t been sleeping well lately,&#34; he said abruptly, his voice low and steady.&#34;Are you overwhelmed with the project?&#34;  &#34;Just a little,&#34; Brinley answered evasively, snatching her fitness tracker from the table. &#34;Things will get better soon. I&#39;m heading to the company now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching the tracker, she hurried out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after stepping outside the villa did she let out a long, heavy breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley didn&#39;t want Austin to know about her participation in the exhibition race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t prepared to reveal that part of herself to him yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, she decided, it was best to keepo him in the dark about her secret identity.</p>
