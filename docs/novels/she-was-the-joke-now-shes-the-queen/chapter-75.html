                <p>Brinley studied the sketch, her eyes gradually brightening. &#34;This could actually work! But... why is Jasiah so set on targeting our project? The Moore Group has interests in countless industries. Why doesn&#39;t he touch those instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin set the pen down, staring at her face as he replied in a low, firm voice, &#34;Because he knows I&#39;d lose it if he went after you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s chest tightened, a mix of warmth and bitterness stirring inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this entire mess wasn&#39;t really about her at all; it was about Austin. She was only an unfortunate casualty caught in the middle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what&#39;s your plan?&#34; she inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Teach him a lesson. I&#39;ll show him that there&#39;s a price for crossing anyone close to me.&#34; Austin&#39;s eyes turned cold and menacing as he reached for his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dialed Miguel and spoke into the phone. &#34;Miguel,look into the bidding records for the Riverside project Jasiah handled last year.&#34; When he hung up, he noticed the tension on Brinley&#39;s face. He reached over and gently ruffled her hair.&#34;Don&#39;t stress. You will pass the review next week. For now,just focus on finishing the sky garden design.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley stared at him, suddenly realizing something &#34;You knew from the start that Ryder was behind this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| suspected as much,&#34; Austin admitted calmly.&#34;Schemes like this are his style.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley was frustrated. &#34;Then why didn&#39;t you say anything earlier? I&#39;ve been worrying for nothing all this time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to see how tough you really are.&#34; Austin gave a low chuckle. &#34;And you&#39;ve proven to be even stronger than I expected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Brinley&#39;s irritation faded into reluctant acceptance. &#34;Fine. But next time something like this happens, at least give me a heads-up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t do that,&#34; Austin said casually, raising an eyebrow. &#34;But I&#39;ll always be on your side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley fell silent, not knowing how to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the next three days, she threw herself into leading her design team, working nonstop to incorporate the sky garden into the overall project. Every evening, Austin would drop by, not to interrupt,but to sit nearby handling his own work. Whenever she hit a block, he&#39;d quietly offer a suggestion that helped her push through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By Friday afternoon, the revised design was finally submitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley stared nervously at the progress bar on the approval system,her palms clammy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s approved!&#34; Corbin suddenly shouted, pointing at the screen. &#34;Mr. Saunders even said it&#39;s innovative and worth promoting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flooded with relief, Brinley slumped into her chair and exhaled deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, when she walked through the door of the villa, the scent of food drifted out to greet her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin was in the kitchen, apron tied around his waist,bathed in the soft glow of the setting sun as he carried out a dish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re back,&#34; he said with a warm smile in his eyes.&#34;We&#39;re celebrating your success tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later during dinner, Brinley couldn&#39;t hold back her curiosity. &#34;What exactly did you do to Jasiah? His sudden turnaround is completely unexpected.&#34; Austin slid a piece of fish onto her plate and answered casually, &#34;Just had Miguel send the disciplinary committee an anonymous report on his shady practices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley was momentarily speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was Austin&#39;s style through and through-direct,efficient, and decisive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Ryder?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s tied up dealing with the committee&#39;s investigation now. He doesn&#39;t have time to make trouble for us.&#34; Austin took a slow sip of soup, his eyes fixed on her. &#34;But this is only the start. My family is capable of playing far dirtier than you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley had a concerned frown on her face now. &#34;Are you saying...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting his utensils down and looking at her seriously,Austin began, &#34;Well, it&#39;s too late to back out now.You&#39;re bound to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley met his gaze, then suddenly laughed. &#34;Back out? Do you really think I&#39;m afraid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin simply smiled in return, refusing to say anything Austin&#39;s move forced Ryder to focus on cleaning up his own mess, leaving him no time to sabotage Brinley&#39;s project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her work finally returned to its normal pace. As progress advanced, she carved out her spare hours to keep training for the exhibition race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One morning, she was already at the gym by six o&#39;clock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ran for forty minutes, with sweat-soaked strands of hair sticking to her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heart rate monitor on her wrist buzzed,signaling that her pulse had spiked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her core strength was back to about seventy percent of what it once had been, yet whenever she pushed herself this hard, her muscles still protested with a dull ache from the strain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley clenched her jaw, ignored the warning flashing on her monitor, and pushed the treadmill speed up another notch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a faint thud disrupted the stillness of the gym.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned toward the sound. Austin stood there,two cups in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was wearing a gray sports vest, his shoulders and back sharply defined in the morning light, with sweat still glistening on his arms from a round of dumbbell lifts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still not done?&#34; he called out, walking over and offering her one of the cups. &#34;I added honey. It&#39;s at the perfect temperature.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since he discovered her training, Brinley had stopped bothering with excuses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She enjoyed working out and wanted to stay strong and in shape. There was nothing wrong with that, of course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Austin had made it a routine too, showing up every morning for hisworkouts, sometimes peeling off his top when he felt too hot, flaunting his toned abs without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley accepted the cup, her fingers brushing against the back of Austin&#39;s hand. His skin was slick and hot from exercise, burning against hers like a small flame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a sip, the honeyed water soothing her parched throat instantly.</p>
