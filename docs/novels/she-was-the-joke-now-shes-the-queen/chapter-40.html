                <p>The mood at breakfast felt far lighter than the tense silence of the day before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s stunt of sleeping in the garden had caught everyone off guard. Those who had planned to give her trouble now watched her with a mix of curiosity and speculation, their open hostility softening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Westley, clearly in a good mood, kept piling food onto Brinley&#39;s plate while recounting one embarrassing childhood tale after another about Austin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley burst into laughter, sneaking a glance at Austin, whosat composedly with his milk, sipping as if the stories had nothing to do with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the meal ended, Miguel hurried in and bent close to whisper something into Austin&#39;s ear.  Word had spread to Austin&#39;s siblings-news that he&#39;d brought his bride home had sent them all clamoring to return and meet her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint crease formed between Austin&#39;s brows before he turned to Westley. &#34;Dad, something came up at the company. I&#39;ll leave with Brinley now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood exactly what his siblings were after:not a warm welcome, but a chance to test Brinley.And he had no intention of letting her face another round of scrutiny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Westley nodded with a knowing smile. &#34;Go on, just promise me you&#39;ll remember to eat on time, even if work piles up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Brinley, he added warmly, &#34;Make sure you visit often whenever you can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; Brinley answered with an easy smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the verge of leaving, Austin paused to give Caiden a few instructions, while Brinley lingered by the doorway. Austin returned quickly, his movements sure as he slipped his hand naturally into hers. &#34;What&#39;s on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing important.&#34; She shook her head and followed him out of the estate. &#34;Are we heading back to Hillcrest Villa now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right. I&#39;ll take you back first.&#34; With practiced ease, Austin opened the passenger door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding into the seat, Brinley hesitated before speaking. &#34;Could you stop at the intersection ahead?I&#39;d like to swing by the company first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her small firm was tucked inside an office building in the heart of downtown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the project had ground to a halt, most of the staff were on extended leave, leaving only a skeleton crew still working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided to stop by with food as a small gesture of thanks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go with you,&#34; Austin said without hesitation. Brinley immediately waved him off. &#34;No, really, I can handle it. Don&#39;t you have work piling up? Go take care of that-I&#39;ll be fine on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of having him shadowing her at her own office made her squirm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s brows drew together as he studied her. &#34;Do l come across as frightening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head quickly. &#34;No, that&#39;s not it..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why keep dodging me?&#34; His tone carried an edge of irritation, each word deliberate. &#34;I&#39;ll have the driver take you. And I&#39;ll just wait in the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley faltered, tongue-tied beneath the weight of his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did it strike her that she might, in truth, be pulling away from him on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it unease? Or something deeper she didn&#39;t dare name?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last she exhaled and gave a small nod. &#34;Fine. Thank you for giving me a ride.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief softened his expression. He pulled out his laptop, his focus shifting to the screen as his long fingers danced across the keys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car soon settled into silence, broken only by the steady rhythm of his typing that filled the quiet space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated at his side, Brinley found herself sneaking sideways glances she couldn&#39;t quite resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunlight spilled through the window, painting his profile in warm gold and sharpening the edges of his already striking features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t deny it-Austin looked exactly like the kind of man she&#39;d always found herself drawn to,every detail checking the boxes of her secret preferences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brinley&#39;s thoughts drifted, Austin turned his head abruptly, catching her with a direct, steady gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enjoying the view?&#34; he asked, a faintly teasing smile curving his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flustered, she snapped her head toward the window.Her voice came out awkward and defensive. &#34;What? I wasn&#39;t... I was just admiring the scenery. The view on your side happens to be better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beyond the glass, only a blur of busy streets stretched out-nothing remotely scenic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s low chuckle slipped out, but he didn&#39;t press her lie. He returned his attention to the laptop resting on his knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning against the cool windowpane, Brinley felt warmth creeping up her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she dared another sidelong glance, Austin was still immersed in his screen, not sparing her a look.She exhaled quietly in relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car rolled steadily toward the city center, tires humming against the asphalt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After she scrolled aimlessly on her phone, boredom set in, and her gaze drifted back to Austin without her realizing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small pause, she slipped her phone into silent mode, hesitated, then discreetly angled it to capture his sharp profile in secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sunlight caught his brow just right in the photo,sharpening his focus and making him impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley lingered on the image, a subtle smile tugging at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even a few stolen glances at his face were enough to brighten her mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if sensing her, Austin turned, his gaze locking with hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flustered, she ducked her head and pretended to scroll through her phone. &#34;Huh? What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He studied her nervous act, amusement sparking in his eyes, but chose silence, returning to his papers with a slight curve to his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her shoulders loosened in relief, the car lurched violently to the side. The driver must have swerved hard to avoid something, and her phone slipped from her hands with a sharp thud as her body pitched forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of striking the seat in front of her, she crashed against the solid warmth of a broad chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch...&#34; Her nose smacked into Austin&#39;s shoulder,the sting so sharp it sent tears pricking at her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin reacted instantly, his arms circling her in a firm catch before she could tumble further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You hurt?&#34; His deep voice carried a note of alarm above her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blinking back the sting, Brinley/ realized she was sprawled across his lap, her fingers clenching the fabric of his shirt as if holding on for balance.</p>
