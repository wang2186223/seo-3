                <p>Brinley finally understood what Austin was doing-he wasn&#39;t going to confront Milly outright. Instead,he planned to make someone else push her into paying for her own schemes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The strategy carried a ruthless elegance, but Brinley found it far more satisfying than any direct clash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re really cunning,&#34; she murmured under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching her faint smile, Austin&#39;s gaze softened, the frost in his eyes thawing. &#34;If I&#39;m not cunning enough,how can I protect you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rushed to her cheeks at the weight of his words,and she quickly turned away, feigning interest in the night lights spilling through the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence stretched, boken only by the steady tick of the wall clock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Brinley could feel Austin&#39;s eyes lingering on her,his attention sharp and unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind drifted back to those early days, when she  had eyed him with suspicion-believing their whirlwwind marriage was a calculated move, and his affection a complete facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her doubts began to falter as she watched him care for her, even willing to challenge the Palmer family head-on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered her small preferences and cooked meals just for her. Earlier, when he saw her injured,he had pulled her into his arms anxiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those gestures, like a slow-steeped infusion of warmth,seeped quietly into her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She realized that his care for her was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s on your mind?&#34; Austin&#39;s voice broke through the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Brinley looked up into his eyes and mumbled,a bit flustered, &#34;Nothing, just... thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting his head slightly, he raised a brow and asked,&#34;Only thanks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved into a faint smirk as she shot back.&#34;What more are you expecting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet laugh slipped from him as he rose, moving to her bedside. He leaned down, close enough for his breath to stir across her forehead. &#34;When you&#39;re  better,how about you buy me dinner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The closeness of his presence sent her pulse into a stumble, her heart tripping over itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The urge to retreat flickered through her, halted by the tender weight of his hand at her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move.&#34; His voice was low and rough-edged,carrying a quiet command. &#34;Let me see your wound.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes dropped to the bandage on her arm,fingertips grazing its edge with painstaking care, each movement as if he were handling something impossibly fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warm ache unfurled in her chest, a softness she hadn&#39;t expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It really doesn&#39;t hurt anymore,&#34; she murmured, her tone carrying an unintentional dependence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin rose and smoothed the blanket around her shoulders. &#34;If you&#39;re tired, close your eyes. I&#39;ll stay and keep watch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body, still tense from the earlier fright and drained from the storm of emotions, yielded to exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a small nod and let her eyes close, though sleep clung stubbornly out of reach. The faint rustle of papers and the occasional baritone murmur of Austin handling business calls threaded through the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in that clipped, decisive tone, his voice carried a steadiness that soothed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time slipped away unnoticed, until at last, drowsiness overtook her and she drifted into sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brinley woke again, the sky beyond the window had already deepened into full night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the bedside lamp glowed softly, casting a warm halo over Austin, who had dozed off in a chair beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked as though he feared disturbing her, never daring to climb into the bed. His body remained in that stiff position, his brow faintly furrowed as though some restless thought refused to let him go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dark circles under his eyes made Brinley&#39;s chest ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew how heavy his days had been-juggling company afairs while still worrying over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quietly, she shifted, meaning to drape something over his shoulders. Yet th e moment her hand reached toward him,his lashes fluttered and he stirred. &#34;You&#39;re awake.&#34; His voice carried the gravel of sleep as he rubbed his eyes. &#34;Do you want some water?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley gave a small shake of her head. &#34;You should lie down on the sofa. You&#39;ll hurt your back sitting like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m not sleepy anymore.&#34; Rising, Austin poured her a glass of warm water with steady hands.&#34;What about you? Hungry at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s stomach did give a small protest, so she nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin wasted no time and called for the nurse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, the nurse wheeled in a cart carrying a steaming bowl of porridge with a few light side dishes. The warm, simple aroma filled the quiet room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin took the bowl himself, carefully feeding Brinley spoon by spoon. As he watched her eat with clear appetite, a trace of relief softened his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tidying up the dishes afterward, he remarked, &#34;Miguel just sent word. The Palmer family&#39;s been stirred up-Kashton called Colin back and scolded him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s all?&#34; Brinley blinked, surprised by how light the punishment was. Austin let out a quiet laugh. &#34;That&#39;s only the opening move. Kashton values financial gain above all else.What Milly has done not only brings shame to Colin and the Palmers, but it also jeopardizes their land bid in the eastern district. He won&#39;t simply brush this off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin lingered for a moment before speaking again.&#34;By the way, I had Miguel dig into that project Milly helped Colin land. Seems the entire deal is messy with irregularities. I&#39;ve already had the evidence delivered anonymously to the authorities. It&#39;s only a matter of time before they&#39;re dragged under.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Brinley understand-Austin had orchestrated everything right from the very beginning.He moved quietly, yet each strike wvas sharper than the last,leaving Milly with nowhere to turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Brinley stared at him, struggling to form a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never imagined he would go to such lengths for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching her thoughts, Austin crossed to her bedside,settled down, and wrapped his fingers gently around her uninjured hand. &#34;Don&#39;t let it weigh on you. People like that don&#39;t deserve mercy. And besides-this isn&#39;t just for you. It&#39;s for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For you?&#34; Brinley blinked, confused. &#34;Yeah.&#34; His nod was firm, his gaze unwavering. &#34;You are my wife. I won&#39;t let anyone lay a finger on you.&#34;</p>
