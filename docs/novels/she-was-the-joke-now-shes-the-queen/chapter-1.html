                <p>Brinley Shaw set her resignation letter on the HR manager&#39;s desk, her fingertips smoothing the edge of the paper as though ensuring not a single fold or wrinkle remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager parted his lips, a resigned sigh escaping before he spoke. &#34;It&#39;s such a pityto see you leaving,Brinley.Are you absolutely certain about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Brinley said with a soft smile, her eyes curving like crescents. &#34;I&#39;d like to spend more time with my family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping out of thecompany building,she was met by a flood of sunlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squinted against the glare and pulled a pair of sunglasses from her bag, slipping them on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her phone buzzed. It was a message from Ryland Francis, a real estate agent. &#34;Mrs. Palmer, the owner of the villa you like has agreed to lower the price. Could you come view it this afternoon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley smiled at the good news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That small villa on the outskirts of the city-a place  she had admired for a long time-stood far away from the noise and bustle of downtown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Its peaceful surroundings might just be the opportunity she needed to strengthen her fragile marriage with Colin Palmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Married for two years, she and Colin had never once been intimate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the beginning, she had convinced herself his hectic work schedule was to blame, but gradually, doubts about her own attractiveness began to creep in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally admitting that something had to change, she quit her job to spend more time with her husbandand salvage their relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That afternoon, she visited the villa. It turned out to be even more charming in reality than in the photographs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elderly couple who owned it had kept a garden brimming with roses, their sweet perfume lingering heavily in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing in the middle of the sunlit living room,Brinley watched her shadow stretch long across the polished floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the one! How do we proceed?&#34; she said in a firm voice. Ryland&#39;s face lit up. &#34;Excellent! I&#39;ll prepare the contract immediately. By the way, will Mr. Palmer be joining you to sign?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley shook her head. &#34;No, he&#39;s tied up with work.I&#39;ll take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then. Please bring all necessary documents with you tomorrow for the paperwork.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On her way home,Brinley sent Colin a quick message.&#34;I resigned and found a villa I love. I&#39;m planning to buy it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reply came almost instantly. &#34;So sudden? But if it makes you happy, that&#39;s what matters. I&#39;ll come home early tonight; we&#39;ll celebrate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth spread through Brinley&#39;s chest as she gazed at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin had always treated her with care and tenderness.He remembered her favorite meals, always had sweet treats ready when she had her period, and never missed an anniversary without a thoughtful gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apart from his refusal to be intimate with her-which upset her deeply-he was nearly the perfect husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Brinley dressed with special care before leaving for the real estate agency. She chose a pink-and-white dress, the very one Colin often praised as suiting her best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Palmer, please, have a seat,&#34; Ryland greeted her warmly. &#34;I&#39;ll bring out the contract.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling, Brinley passed him a folder. &#34;Here&#39;s a copy of my marriage certificate with Colin. I would like to register the house as a joint marital property.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland accepted it and tapped away at the computer for a while, but soon he frowned. &#34;That&#39;s odd... The system isn&#39;t pulling up your marriage registration record.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s smile faltered. &#34;What do you mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Probably just a system error,&#34; Ryland said quickly,trying to reassure her. &#34;You can confirm it directly at city hall. It happens every now and then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s chest pounded wildly. A creeping sense of unease overwhelmed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing herself to stay calm, she replied, &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll head there right away.&#34;</p>
