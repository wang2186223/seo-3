                <p>Over the next few days, Brinley&#39;s thoughts circled endlessly, replaying every detail of Austin in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered the elegance of his hands, firm yet graceful, as he passed her a drink; the way his smile tugged at her heart when she playfully pulled at his ear; and the soothing cadence of his heartbeat when he held her close in the stillness of night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no,&#34; Brinley groaned, burying her face deep into her pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t some fleeting fancy or silly crush; it was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had fallen for Austin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her whole body shuddered at the realization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wounds Colin left behind hadn&#39;t even begun to heal properly, and yet here she was, letting her heart stumble again.Argh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just some tender gestures, a handful of drinks, the brush of solid muscle under her fingertips, and suddenly her heart was fluttering out of control. &#34;Brinley, are you such an idiot?&#34; She gave her forehead a smack in self-reprimand. &#34;You only ever think with your heart. Honestly, there&#39;s no saving you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined not to fall any deeper, Brinley hatched an elaborate plan to steer clear of Austin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the mornings, she slipped out of the house before he ever came downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the upstairs window, Austin once caught sight of her vanishing quickly down the street. It left him puzzled, yet he didn&#39;t chase after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nightly returns to the villa became something like a spy movie-stealthy and calculated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would arrive home a little earlier than him, snatch a quick bite from the kitchen, then shut herself up in her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On other nights, she lingered outside until late,slipping through the front door under the moonlight,careful not to switch on a single light in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If their paths crossed, she would offer a brisk exchange before fleeing as if he were a predator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One evening, as Brinley sank into her bathtub, steam curling around her, a knock sounded at her door. &#34;Brinley?&#34; Austin called, his voice low and slightly hoarse. &#34;There&#39;s warm milk waiting for you. It&#39;ll help you sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley almost stopped breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How on earth had he noticed her insomnia?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, thanks!&#34; she called back, forcing her voice to sound upbeat. &#34;I&#39;m fine, and I&#39;m going to bed now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief pause, followed by Austin&#39;s chuckle.&#34;I&#39;ll leave it by your door. Drink it while it&#39;s warm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his footsteps faded, Brinley leaned over the edge of the tub, listening to the hammering in her chest, and raked her fingers through her damp hair in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why couldn&#39;t he simply leave her alone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley reluctantly finished her bath and stepped out to discover a glass resting at her door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning against the frame, she sipped the milk in small, careful mouthfuls. The gentle warmth coursed through her,easing the tight coil in her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once finished, she thought to return the glass. But as she reached Austin&#39;s room, the door stood slightly ajar, a golden glow spilling out Inexplicably, she stopped in her tracks. Then she caught the faint clatter of keys drifting from inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Austin still working at this late hour?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to retreat when the door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin stood there in casual loungewear, hair still damp from a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He arched an eyebrow when he spotted her. what exactly are you sneaking around for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Brinley nearly dropped the glass. &#34;N-nothing ... just bringing this back,&#34; she stammered, thrusting it into his hands before attempting to bolt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he pulled her back by the wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth of his touch made Brinley&#39;s heart quiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been avoiding me for days,&#34; Austin said,staring at her.&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s heartbeat stumbled wildly, and though she tried to yank her hand free, Austin&#39;s grip was firm.Cornered into keeping up the act, she snapped, &#34;I&#39;ve been avoiding you? Come on, you&#39;re imaging things.I&#39;ve just been swamped with work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so? And you can&#39;t even sit down for a meal?&#34;Austin pressed. &#34;Is it that you regret what you said  that night, wanting to brush it off as drunken talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I..&#34; Brinley&#39;s face burned crimson as he saw right through her. &#34;That was just nonsense after drinking; it doesn&#39;t mean anything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh?&#34; Austin leaned closer teasingly. &#34;But | took your words seriously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind went blank, his words striking like a thunderclap. She stared up at him, meeting the amusement in his eyes, her panic written plain across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Brinley began, but her tongue failed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin let go of her wrist, his hand rising instead to stroke her hair, the gesture so natural, so intimate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go get some rest,&#34; he muttered before retreating into his room and shutting the door softly behind him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley stood rooted in place, fingers brushing the spot on her wrist where his warm palm had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in her room, she lay flat on her bed, staring at the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it really so difficult to admit she liked him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Colin&#39;s face suddenly surfaced in her thoughts, the sting of his lies and betrayal pricking at her like sharp  needles</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley squeezed her eyes shut and shook her head hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. She couldn&#39;t let history repeat itself. The more perfect Austin seemed, the more she had to keep her distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Falling headlong into love again was the last thing she needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scolded herself over and over. Sleep wouldn&#39;t come. Instead, Austin&#39;s words kept echoing in her mind. &#34;But I took your words seriously.&#34;</p>
