                <p>Brinley slipped on her earpiece. The voice changer transformed her clear tone into a low, neutral rumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All good,&#34; she told Jensen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she settled into the driver&#39;s seat, a wave of familiarity washed over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suede steering wheel, smoothed by years of her grip, was her own choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pedals were meticulously adjusted to her feet,and the seat was tilted just right for maximum effort</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the engine roared to life, its deep growl was like a beast awakening, vibrating through the seat with raw power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s fingers tapped lightly on the wheel,her eyes scanning the dashboard&#39;s flickering numbers, a grin spreading across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rosara, do you want a warm-up lap?&#34; Jensen asked from outside the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need,&#34; Brinley replied, snapping her seatbelt into  place, her relaxed air giving way to razor-sharp focus &#34;Let&#39;s hit the track!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The red racecar launched from the pit like a shot,slicing through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the first turn, she cranked the wheel, the car drifting through the corner at its limit, tires screaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wind whipped through the open window, tugging at her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley zeroed in on the track, her senses razor-sharp.After two laps, her old rhythm clicked back into place</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the final corner, she held off braking for an extra 0.3 seconds, letting the car dive into the turn with reckless flair, its tail brushing dangerously close to the barrier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her signature move from years ago, always catching rivals off guard at the last second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect!&#34; Jensen&#39;s voice crackled through the earpiece, brimming with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley had just begun to relax when a new roar erupted from the track&#39;s entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound was deep and primal, like a predator baring its teeth. The sound alone screamed it was a high-displacement, heavily modified racing machine. Brinley eased off the gas, her red car slowing on the straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the rearview mirror, a black racecar streaked in like a bolt of lightning, carving through corners with surgical precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley froze, her eyes locked on the car.Its cornering angles and throttle control were hauntingly familiar,echoing her old rival, Nlightblade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The black car closed in fast, pulling alongside her on the straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart skipped a beat, her grip tightening on the wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both cars rolled to a stop at the pit entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The black car&#39;s door swung open, and a man in a sleek black racing suit stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he removed his helmet, sharp features emerged,sweat tracing his jawline, glinting in the sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s breath caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin? How could he be here? Wasn&#39;t he supposed to be meeting clients overseas?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had lied to her! Austin&#39;s eyes widened slightly as he spotted Rosara,his gaze catching the rose emblem on her helmet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Rosara&#39;s legendary days, copycats had swarmed,especially after she vanished. Her rose emblem had become a talisman for some, hoping to borrow her luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin studied her, clearly wondering if she was the real Rosara or just another pretender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning against his car, fingers drumming lightly on the roof, Austin asked, &#34;First time here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley deepened her voice, letting the voice changer blunt her tone. &#34;Heard this track was open for practice,so I thought I would have some fun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced an awkward edge to her words, mimicking a nervous rookie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fun,huh?&#34; Austin chuckled, his eyes scanning her red car. &#34;Interesting mods. That air intake grille&#39;s tuned for low-speed corners but compromises straight-line speed. Whoever built this is a tactical driver.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s pulse quickened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Few,even among top mechanics, would notice those details so quickly. She pretended to check the tires, brushing her fingers over the warm rubber surface. &#34;A friend&#39;s gift. I don&#39;t understand modifications. As long as it drives, it&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Austin stepped closer, stopping by her driver&#39;s side. &#34;Your line says otherwise. Delaying the brake by 0.3 seconds on that last corner-bold move.Skill or dumb luck?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley froze, glancing up through her tinted visor,meeting his probing stare</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just messing around,&#34; she said, turning the key to rev the engine. &#34;I don&#39;t know anything about braking points. My foot probably slipped.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin didn&#39;t let her off so easily, tapping her window lightly. &#34;Your left hand drags the wheel half a turn down when cornering-a classic racer&#39;s technique.Most new drivers just muscle through with their arms Not many have that kind of finesse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran down Brinley&#39;s spine. That move was a rare trick she had picked up from an old coach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe... it&#39;s just a coincidence,&#34; she muttered,sliding the window shut to cut off the conversation. &#34;I&#39;m going to run a few more laps.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on,&#34; Austin said, his hand stopping her. His eyes flicked to her car&#39;s rear wing. &#34;That angle is too safe.  With your speed on that last corner, you would get better grip by lowering it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, then added with a knowing smile, &#34;But to each their own. Maybe you just like it that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley didn&#39;t answer, slamming the accelerator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The red car surged forward like a loosed arrow, tearing away from the pit.</p>
