                <p>&#34;Why what, exactly?&#34; Austin lowered his fork and grabbed a napkin, gently dabbing the sauce from the corner of Brinley&#39;s mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you so kind to me?&#34; Brinley said with a blink.&#34;You&#39;ve been so kind to me-cooking,helping me out -but | can&#39;t figure out why. Is there an ulterior motive?Are you another Colin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s eyes narrowed, his voice firm. &#34;I&#39;m nothing like him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How so?&#34; Brinley pressed, suddenly prodding his cheek. &#34;Though, I must say, you&#39;re way better looking than he is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cool fingers grazed Austin&#39;s skin, making his breath hitch for a split second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for her hand, but Brinley nimbly dodged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers trailedalong his jaw. &#34;Such sharp features -like a sculpted masterpiece! And those red ears are absolutely adorable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giggling, she gave his earlobe a playful tug. Austin let out a resigned sigh. &#34;Brinley, enough messing around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not messing around!&#34; she shot back, slipping her other hand under his shirt, her fingers brushing his toned waist. Her eyes sparkled. &#34;Wow, abs! So solid!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s body stiffened instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught her wandering wrist, his voice turning husky &#34;Brinley, keep this up, and I won&#39;t hold back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; She tilted her head, eyes glassy but asly smile spreading. &#34;What wvill you do? Force a kiss on me like a hero from those romantic novels?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could respond, she slipped free, leaning in so close their noses nearly brushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin turned his face away, gently stroking her hair.&#34;You&#39;re too tipsy to know what you&#39;re doing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley froze, a sudden wave of hurt washing over her as her eyes reddened. &#34;Do you think I&#39;m annoying? I know... I&#39;m just a coward. I try to suppress my feelings for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sniffling, her voice trembled. &#34;But you&#39;re so handsome and so kind... If I were not terrified of another heartbreaker, I would chase you without a second thought! Even if it&#39;s just a fling, it feels... worth it.&#34; Her words dripped with drunken sincerity</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting her head, she slumped onto Austin&#39;s shoulder,her breathing evening out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin glanced down, a soft smile breaking through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He carefully scooped her up, carrying her upstairs. As he moved, the butler discreetly ushered the staff out,leaving only a faint wall light glowing in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley stirred in his arms, seeking a cozy spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers clung to his shirt collar, grazing his collarbone, sending a shiver through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the bedroom, Austin set her on the wide bed. As he started to rise, she gripped his wrist tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t leave, please,&#34; she murmured, eyes shut,lashes damp. &#34;When you were in the hospital, I stayed... It&#39;s time for you to return the favor now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plea was soft, and it was hard for Austin to turn her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He settled by the bed, watching her sleep, his hand gently brushing her flushed cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Silly girl,&#34; he whispered. &#34;This was never a game to me. My feelings for you are real-that&#39;s the only reason I treat you this way.&#34; Moonlight slipped through the sheer curtains, bathing her face in a soft glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin sat, listening to her steady breaths until late in the night. Then, he draped a blanket over the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the quiet night, Brinley rolled groggily toward the bed&#39;s edge, nearly falling-until a strong arm caught her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She instinctively nestled into the warmth, curling into Austin&#39;s arms and drifting off again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin gazed at her, defenseless in his hold, and sighed softly, letting her cling to his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand gently patted her back, as if calming a startled creature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At dawn, a tickle on her neck roused Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blinking sleepily, she found Austin&#39;s sleeping face inches away-long lashes, sharp nose,lips set in a firm line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand clutched his pajama collar,her body practically sprawled over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she jolted upright, last night&#39;s memories flooded back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had playfully pulled Austin&#39;s earlobe, grazed his  toned abs, and rambled ridiculous, teasing words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She covered her face. Had she really done all that to Austin? She couldn&#39;t believe it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rubbing his eyes, Austin stirred and sat up, spotting her crimson cheeks. His eyes twinkled with mischief.&#34;Up already? You said you would chase me last night.Are you still planning to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s face burned, wishing the floor would swallow her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing a pillow, she hurled it at him, voice sharp with embarrassment. &#34;Austin, shut up! I said no such thing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught the pillow easily, chuckling as he smoothed her tousled hair. &#34;Fine, my mistake. I must have dreamed it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the gleam in his eyes screamed he had heard every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mortified and fuming, Brinley yanked the blanket over her head,hiding from view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin eyed the blanket lump, his smile widening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunlight spilled through the curtain gaps, dancing in his eyes. He thought, maybe, winning her heart wouldn&#39;t take long after all.</p>
