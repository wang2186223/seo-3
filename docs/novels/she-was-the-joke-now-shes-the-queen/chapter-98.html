                <p>As Brinley and Austin arrived back at Hillcrest Villa, the butler was overseeing the staff as they packed supplies into the vehicle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Numerous crates were piled near the doorway, appearing quite weighty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s all this?&#34; Brinley asked, her brow arching curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Replacement parts and safety. equipment arranged for you,&#34; Austin replied casually, loosening his jacket with an easy demeanor. &#34;A mechanic will be on-site to tweak anything necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s thoughts drifted to that past incident when her brakes had given out-a memory that now made Austin&#39;s concern perfectly clear. Still, she couldn&#39;t resist teasing him. &#34;So all this fuss is because you&#39;re worried about me? Just so you know, I might lose badly. All this gear will be wasted on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin grinned. &#34;Even if you finish dead last, the equipment has to meet top-tier standards.You&#39;re my wife-I would never give you anything less.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words left Brinley momentarily speechless, and she watched his back as he walked away,humming softly before heading to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, after bathing, Brinley sprawled on her bed, the soft glow of her bedside lamp illuminating a detailed racetrack map. Every curve and braking zone was precisely annotated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her focus lingered on a tricky sequence of S-curves, her fingers absentmindedly tracing their path on the sheets as a question nagged at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should she ask if Austin would be at the race tomorrow?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ultimately brushed the thought aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether he was a casual racer or the elusive Nightblade who had disappeared from the spotlight, it was irrelevant. Her mission for tomorrow&#39;s race was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would finish the challenge and prove her abilities beyond any skepticism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flicked off the lamp,letting the room fall into darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shutting hereyes, Brinley banished the swirling doubts and soon drifted into a deep slumber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, her internal clock woke her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After freshening up and slipping into her gear, she grabbed her bag and stepped out. The living room was quiet. She saw a warm cup of milk on the dining table, with a note tucked beneath it in Austin&#39;s handwriting.&#34;Don&#39;t forget breakfast-and have this before you go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley took a sip of the milk, and its warmth spread through her, sparking an unexpected comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she reached the door to change her shoes, her phone buzzed with Austin&#39;s message. &#34;You&#39;ve got this.Wishing youa smooth race.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The brief message grounded her in a way she couldn&#39;t quite explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley typed back a quick &#34;Thanks&#34; and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to her, Austin watched from a second-floor window, his gaze lingering until her car vanished from the villa grounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The international exhibition.race was set at a professional circuit on the city&#39;s outskirts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entrance&#39;s digital display cycled through the names of thirty racers-veterans and rising talents, all prominent in the racing scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley parked in a secluded corner of the competitors&#39; lot, donning a plain gray work jacket and tucking her distinctive long hair under a cap to stay unrecognized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She popped the trunk and slid into the unassuming white racecar Austin had provided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Devoid of logos, it looked ordinary next to the heavily modified vehicles nearby. &#34;Well, look who&#39;s here-Brinley?&#34; a cocky voice called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning, she saw three men in logo-covered racing suits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leading them was Ballard Clayton, a frequent third-place finisher in local circuits, flanked by his regular companions, Dominik Norris and Jaxon Frazier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their faces sported sly grins, their approach clearly intentional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34; Brinley asked coolly, her hand steady on the car&#39;s door handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ballard smirked, his voice loud and mocking. &#34;Just stopping by to see how you&#39;re doing. It&#39;s rare to see a real estate developer at a racetrack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominik jumped in, &#34;Yeah, I heard you can&#39;t even pull off a drift. Tell you what: take a one-minute head start.Maybe then you&#39;ll be able to keep up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nearby racers erupted in laughter, their sharp stares cutting through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley saw through their taunts, suspecting Milly&#39;s involvement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That morning, the PR team had flagged new online rumors accusing her of exploiting the exhibition race for business promotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring them, she swung open the car door and settled into the driver&#39;s seat. As she moved to close it,Jaxon leaned on the frame, his tone flippant. &#34;Hold on, Brinley. How about a bet? If you make it through the first lap, I&#39;ll eat this car!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Step back,&#34; she said sharply, her icy glare forcing Jaxon to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plain white racecar rolled forward, their jeers fading into the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley exhaled slowly, redirecting her focus to the track ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t the moment to get distracted-her mission was to conceal Rosara&#39;s skill and accomplish her goal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she reached the competitors&#39; staging area, a mob of reporters rushed toward her, their microphones nearly breaching the car window.</p>
