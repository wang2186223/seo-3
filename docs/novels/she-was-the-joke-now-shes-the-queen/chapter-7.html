                <p>Austin stood tall, his presence so striking that all eyes were irresistibly drawn to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley thought to herself that it was no wonder he was hailed as the most handsome man in Bleron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His appearance, his commanding aura, and his physique-all of it-were far superior to Colin&#39;s in every possible way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ending up with such a wealthy and dazzling husband was nothing short of fortune smiling upon her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley and Austin glanced at each other for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before either could speak,the doors swung open and a sudden commotion filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several business partners entered in a rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Moore, we&#39;ve been waiting anxiously for your arrival.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re always occupied with work; it&#39;s rare to catch a glimpse of you.&#34; The men immediately surrounded Austin, each eager to curry favor, unintentionally pushing Brinley aside in their eagerness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin was noticeably displeased at the interruption,but the group remained oblivious, chattering away with unrestrained enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thalia stepped forward to ease the awkwardness. &#34;Mr.Moore will be spending plenty of time with you today,so there&#39;s no need to hurry. Please, take a seat and have some drinks first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she walked to Brinley and guided her back from the sidelines, smiling as she introduced her.&#34;This is Ms. Brinley Shaw. She&#39;s here today to share some of her business insights with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thalia&#39;s intention was to smooth the atmosphere,but instead, the mention of Brinley&#39;s name triggered a ripple of muffled laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the men, Oliver Simpson, looked Brinley up and down before remarking with a mocking grin, &#34;Ms.Shaw,you are indeed easy on the eyes, but your judgment... perhaps not as impressive. You cut ties with your own family for a man, becoming nothing but a subject of ridicule in Bleron.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another added, &#34;Yes, Ms. Shaw, if you&#39;re so devoted to men, perhaps family affairs should be your focus  rather than business ventures.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver!&#34; Thalia frowned in displeasure, ready to step in,but Austin lifted a hand to stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes immediately turned to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin crossed the room unhurriedly.He reached out and brushed a strand of Brinley&#39;s hair back behind her ear before slipping an arm naturally around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, in your opinion, Mr. Simpson, my wife doesn&#39;t measure up to your standards?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was light but had a menacing undertone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver froze with terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Brinley Shaw who had severed ties with her family and tarnished her name for some man turned out to be the wife of Austin Moore?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver laughed awkwardly, scrambling for words.&#34;Ah,Mrs. Moore, my apologies. Mr. Moore, people say you are not interested in women, but clearly, you have exquisite taste and prefer...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, then continued, &#34;Prefer beautiful women.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he was offering a compliment, his eyes clearly conveyed subtle contempt. Thalia scowled, ready to intervene again,but Austin signaled for her to hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of speaking, he studied Brinley with interest,clearly curious about how she would handle the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smirking, Brinley turned to address Oliver. &#34;Mr.Simpson, your words remind me of something. I once heard that some influential businessmen have a fondness for keeping several young women at once.They are really shameless. Surely you&#39;ve heard such rumors too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver went pale at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did maintain several mistresses, some quite young.It wasn&#39;t entirely public, but neither was it a well-kept secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s remark was a clear jab at him. But with Austin standing beside her, Oliver dared not lash out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley had a small smile on her face,glancing around the room. &#34;Instead of speculating about others,wouldn&#39;t it be wiser to tend to your own affairs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words, polite in tone but sharp in substance,deflected the mockery and issued a subtle warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing beside her, Austin looked utterly pleased. He had assumed that Brinley was gentle and reserved,yet here she was, fearless and assertive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the tension, Thalia intervened,laughing lightly.&#34;Well, Brinley certainly has a sharp tongue. Alright,everyone, let&#39;s not take it too seriously. Come, let&#39;s sit down. No need to crowd around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver looked stiff and displeased. But he sat down,not daring to retort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning toward Brinley, Austin whispered, &#34;Quite the impression you&#39;ve made, my dear wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley tilted her head toward him, her smile playful.&#34;Like what you saw?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin only smirked, deciding not to reply. Instead,he gripped Brinley&#39;s waist even tighter.</p>
