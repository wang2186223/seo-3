                <p>A tense silence settled on the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone watched the unfolding drama, disbelief scrawvled on their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would have imagined that the sweet and soft-spoken Brinley could have such a sharp, unrelenting side?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing a little distance away, Colin felt his chest tighten with tangled emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fierce, confident woman before him was nothing like the shy Brinley he had once known, the one who had always looked at him with timid admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That Brinley would never have dared raise her voice,yet here she was, handling a difficult situation with such finesse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guests were still recovering from the drama when a stir rippled through the entrance of the banquet hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin ambled inside, flanked by bodyguards. He looked dangerous and intimidating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing across the room, he caught sight of Rogelio,who looked disheveled and trembling. Then he glanced at Brinley. Her gown was slightly out of place,yet she stood tall and dignified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s eyes had a menacing gleam in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Mr. Moore!&#34; someone gasped in awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring the whispers around himn, Austin walked straight toward Brinley</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without asking a single question, he slipped off his jacket and laid it gently across her shoulders. He then turned and flung a murderous glare at Rogelio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr... Mr. Moore...&#34; Rogelio stammered, his voice quivering uncontrollably. He now looked pale and terrified. &#34;It&#39;s... it&#39;s all a misunderstanding... nothing more...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin didn&#39;t even bother to acknowledge him.Instead,he spoke in a low, decisive tone to his assistant,Miguel Barnes.&#34;Throw him out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, glancing around, he announced coldly, &#34;From this moment forward, Moore Group will be targeting every single project run by Scott Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit like thunder, drawing audible gasps as faces paled all around</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rogelio&#39;s knees nearly buckled. He tried to plead,but the bodyguards had already dragged him away &#34;Mr. Moore, please! Have mercy! I was wrong!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His desperate cries echoed down the corridor until they vanished, leaving the hall swallowed in an eerie silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every head turned back toward Austin and Brinley,stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They knew well enough. Austin never made idle threats. Scott Group was finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin stood rooted in the crowd. He had watched Austin wrap his jacket around Brinley&#39;s shoulders protectively. A bitter ache stirred deep within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He longed to step forward, to say something,but his legs felt heavy, as though shackled to the floor</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What right did he have anymore?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside Austin, Brinley felt the shelter of his tall frame,a sense of safety creeping over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Rogelio hauled away in disgrace and the once -lively hall frozen in fear,she could only smile wryly in amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced up at Austin&#39;s face and asked softly,still bewildered, &#34;Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Austin almost never appeared at such public events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you&#39;re here,&#34; Austin answered simply, as if it were the most natural thing in the world</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin&#39;s chest throbbed as he watched them both act intimate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just moments earlier, he had entertained the foolish thought that he could play her savior</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet compared to Austin, he looked pitifully powerless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The orchestra resumed its playing, but the vibrant chatter had vanished, replaced by hushed murmurs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who had been oblivious about Brinley and Austin&#39;s relationship now understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with understanding came respect and caution.Brinley was no longer someone they would dare provoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One bold reporter seized the moment, stepping forward nervously. &#34;Mr. Moore, may I ask... Who is this lady?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opportunities to question Austin in person were rare,and no journalist would let it slip by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is my wife, Brinley Moore,&#34; Austin replied without hesitation. He paused,sweeping his eyes over the hall, his voice firm and resonant. &#34;My wife and I share a profound bond, and I warn those harboring hidden intentions not to waste their time with cheap tricks. Anyone who dares to lay a hand on my wife will findthemselves standing against the full power of Moore Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words slammed into Colin like a heavy blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The seasoned businessmen present understood the message immediately. One by one, they approached Brinley to express courtesy and goodwill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly&#39;s face had taken a sickly color as she instinctively clutched Colin&#39;s arm, but he shook her hand off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his turmoil, Colin forced his way toward Brinley. With a stiff smile, he said, &#34;Brinley, don&#39;t you remember how your throat always troubled you every summer? I had someone prepare the special drink you used to like. Would you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for the thought, Mr. Palmer.&#34; Austin stepped in, his voice polite yet cold. &#34;But I&#39;ll take care of my wife&#39;s needs. There&#39;s no need for you to trouble yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes then flicked toward Milly. &#34;And Mr. Palmer,perhaps you should direct more of that concern toward your wife.&#34; He paused deliberately, smirking. &#34;Wait, my mistake,&#34;he corrected himself smoothly. &#34;The lady beside you isn&#39;t your wife yet,is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly blanched, her complexion chalk white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin stiffened, as though struck by lightning, his fists clenching tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley grabbed the opportunity, slipping her hand around Austin&#39;s arm. With a polite but cold smile,she said, &#34;Mr. Palmer, my husband doesn&#39;t enjoy socializing. If you&#39;ll excuse us, we&#39;ll be leaving now.&#34;</p>
