                <p>&#34;Stayed up too late again? You&#39;ve got dark circles under your eyes,&#34; Austin remarked, studying Brinley carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley flashed an awkward smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t wrong; she had hardly slept. The night before,she had gotten carried away practicing on her racing simulator until the early hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was buried in work and lost track of time,&#34; she fibbed, then quickly changed the subject. Glancing toward the staircase, she added, &#34;By the way,could I borrow your copy of &#39;Racetrack Engineering Analysis&#39;?We&#39;re preparing a racer interview segment forthe project, and I need to refresh my understanding of the technical details so I can sound well-informed and credible when I&#39;m asking questions during the interviews.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin arched an eyebrow. &#34;All of a sudden, you&#39;re interested in racing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just for work,&#34; Brinley said, keeping her tone calm.&#34;You know the project is racing-themed. I should be able to hold a conversation with the partners, at least.&#34; Austin didn&#39;t push further. With a slight nod, he said,&#34;The book is in my study-the one with the red cover on the third shelf. Be careful with it. It&#39;s out of print.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley already knew it was rare, which was exactly why she had asked him for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded. &#34;Alright, no problems.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled in relief, about to continue,when Austin grabbed his things from the equipment rack. With a casual wave, he said, &#34;I&#39;m heading out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley watched him walk away, realizing only then that her excuse hadn&#39;t been particularly convincing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he already seen through her story?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she stood lost in thought, Austin suddenly turned back. &#34;And make sure you eat regularly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh... okay,&#34; Brinley stammered, snapping back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word,Austin left the gym.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he was gone, Brinley switched off the treadmill and remained in place for a while, taking a moment to steady herself and collect her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind wandered to the book, &#34;Racetrack Engineering Analysis,&#34; which had detailed notes on a professional racer known as Nightblade. Before she retired from racing, she had competed against him,and he&#39;d been a formidable opponent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the passing years, his skills might have gotten better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was rumored that he would be entering the exhibition race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Brinley was going to take part, she wanted nothing less than first place. And knowing her rivals was the first step toward victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked to the window and opened it slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, Austin&#39;s black Maybach rolled slowly down the driveway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood watching until it disappeared at the end of the street before turning toward the staircase and heading into the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the third shelf sat the book with the worn red cover. The gold lettering on its spine was faded from age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, Brinley opened the book and began to read with focused intensity</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The digital clock on the desk ticked softly, switching to seven-thirty. Startled, she snapped the book shut, tucked it under her arm, and rushed out of the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to be at the project site by eight; the supervisor was waiting</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Passing through the kitchen, she noticed a white porcelain bowl set neatly on the table, filled with warm porridge. A small dish of sliced pickles sat beside it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A servant approached and said politely, &#34;Mrs. Moore,Mr. Moore asked me to prepare breakfast for you. He reminded me to tell you not to skip it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Brinley replied softly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed the supervisor would have to wait a little longer</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley sat down, picked up a spoon, and started enjoying her breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, she headed to the project site for the morning. Later that afternoon, Brinley drove to the private racetrack tucked away in the mountains outside the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the exhibition race drawing closer, she needed to get a feel for the track in advance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had arranged the trip discreetly, telling Austin she  would be spending the entire day at the project site,using that as a cover to hide her real intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The track lay hidden among the hills, reachable only by a narrow cement road. The place was closed to the public, open only to a select few. Yet within racing circles, it was well known as a training ground for professionals seeking to escape the spotlight</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley parked her car, pulled on oversized sunglasses and a mask, and retrieved a black suitcase from the trunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unzipping it, she changed quickly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her newly tailored fireproof suit was a deep red,patterned with subtle roses woven into the fabric. It fit snugly and comfortably, molding perfectly to her figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she fastened the helmet over her head, the world&#39;s noise dulled instantly, leaving only the sound of her steady breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the repair area under the canopy, several mechanics in uniforms were working on a silverrace car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brinley appeared, a bearded man broke into a grin. &#34;Rosara! I can&#39;t believe you actually came!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley smiled beneath her helmet. &#34;Jensen, is the car  ready?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; Jensen Rayne, her longtime friend and mechanic, nodded toward the corner. &#34;The red one,modified just like your old setup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before coming, Brinley had reached out to a few people she trusted completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They knew her only by her helmet, having never seen her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want her identity revealed, and they understood not to ask questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking over, Brinley ran her fingertips lightly along the hood of the red car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Its sleek contours gleamed under the light, and the small rose emblem on the side had been her signature on the track.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though years had passed, the cold feel of the mnetal stirred her muscle memory, sending a rush of heat through her fingertips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Jensen,&#34; she mumbled, her voice soft with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The voice changer&#39;s set up,&#34; Jensen said, handing her a Bluetooth earpiece.</p>
