                <p>Brinley stared on at the red racing model, almost gasping in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How on earth did Austin come to own that? And why was it displayed so prominently in the center of his collection?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You like these racing models?&#34; Austin&#39;s voice drifted over, carrying a hint of nonchalance. &#34;I picked these up back when I was obsessed with racing. They have just been sitting there since then; I never really got around to tossing them out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping herself back to the present, Brinley forced down the wave of emotions threatening to rise,struggling to keep her tone calm. &#34;You...you used to race?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, there was a period when I was fascinated by it.&#34; With a casual flick of his wrist, Austin closed the drawer. &#34;But once I took charge of the company, I stopped racing. Why do you ask?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. Just... these models are so finely crafted.&#34;Brinley stared straight into Austin&#39;s eyes, searching their depths for a trace of memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout her years on the track, she had encountered countless opponents. Their eyes had always burned with passion, shrewd calculation, and stubborn defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s eyes, however, were calm and unfathomable, like a deep well that revealed nothing at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bought them on a whim.&#34; He reached for a file on the desk, clearly uninterested in elaborating. &#34;Are you into racing,too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A little,&#34; Brinley replied. &#34;The thrill of speed has always drawn me in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her words trailed off as she glanced down,fearful of revealing too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that he already knew who she really was? Was he deliberately showing her his interest in racing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The faster you go, the more dangerous it gets,&#34;Austin remarked, his tone as detached as if he were dissecting a quarterly report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True.&#34; Brinley no longer felt like keeping the conversation going. She stood, took the empty milk cup in hand, and said, &#34;You should get some rest;don&#39;t stay up too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Austin&#39;s eyes followed her brisk exit, a flicker of curiosity crossing his face, but he made no move to stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley all but rushed out of the study, and by the time she reached her room, her palms had been damp with sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning against the door, she replayed the sight of those racing models and Austin&#39;s unnervingly calm tone when speaking about them. Her mind whirled with thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That red race car was the very one she had driven to victory-a championship model produced in fewer than fifty units worldwide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was such a coincidence that he owned one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, she had competed under the alias &#34;Rosara,&#34; hailed as the queen of racing drivers,winning multiple titles and gathering an enormous following. If Austin truly admired racing, it would make sense for him to collect a model of her championship car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the days that followed, Brinley found herself increasingly drawn to watching him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At dinner, whenever racing was mentioned on the sports news, he always had sharp, precise insights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could break down a racer&#39;s split-second miscalculation, identify an engine failure, or point out technical detailsthat even engineers might overlook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s doubts only grew, pushing her to test him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That Friday night, Austin finished work earlier than</p>
