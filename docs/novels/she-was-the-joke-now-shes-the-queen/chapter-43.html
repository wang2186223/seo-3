                <p>Austin almost looked entertained at being called a &#34;tyrant,&#34; the corner of his mouth softening even as his gaze stayed firm. &#34;Next time you run into someone like that, don&#39;t waste time on courtesy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; Brinley answered lightly, masking the weight of her thoughts. She knew better than to believe it was that simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had the luxury of sitting high above the fray,untouchable no matter who he offended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, she was unlike him, unafraid to be challenged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a single careless move, she could be the one paying the price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she wrestled with that reality, Austin had already turned away, his fingers moving with quick precision across his phone screen, placing a call without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;sme, Austin,&#34; he said, his tone snapping back to its familiar chill. &#34;The parking lot beneath my wife&#39;s office needs to be secured. Mark off a section and assign two dependable men to watch it. No one else is allowed near.&#34; Whatever answer came through the line, Austin cut it short wvith a curt &#34;Okay&#34; before ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley studied him, a trace of weary disbelief flickering in her eyes. &#34;Do you honestly have to make such a big deal over one parking space?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do,&#34; Austin replied, his stare blazing with such heat it nearly burned. &#34;I would not let anyone upset my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words carried a sharp edge, and the intensity in his eyes made Brinley&#39;s chest tighten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d better head up now,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she reached for the car door, her fingers grazed the stack of documents on Austin&#39;s lap, sending several pages sliding to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bent down in a fluster to retrieve them, only to feel his hand press gently over hers, heat seeping through his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Careful now,&#34; he murmured, his deep, magnetic voice brushing against her ear like velvet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley instinctively withdrew her hand, hastily gathering the stack of papers before pressing them into his arms. &#34;I&#39;m heading in now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grin tugged at Austin&#39;s lips as he watched her head into the office building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the back seat, Austin lounged against the leather seat, eyes never leaving the slow spin of the revolving door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the instant Brinley&#39;s silhouette faded inside, the warmth in his expression drained, leaving behind a sharp,frigid stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He noticed a man in a tailored gray suit following her in with purposeful steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Colin. The way he moved-composed and clearly expectant -made it obvious he had been lingering there,waiting for her arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin arched a brow, disdain flickering in his eyes.Colin had the audacity to pester her again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the office, the air was light with chatter and the sweet scent of strawberry cake. A crowd of employees clustered around the long conference table, laughing as they savored generous slices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley, this cake you picked out is incredible!&#34;Corbin Burke, the eager intern, spoke around a mouthful, his cheeks puffed like a chipmunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley chuckled softly, passing him a napkin with a gentle shake of her head. &#34;Slow down-there&#39;s more than enough to go around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had the words left her lips than movement beyond the glass door caught her eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin stood there in a perfectly pressed gray suit, a paper bag dangling from his hand. His tall frame filled the doorway, but the stiffness in his posture betrayed a rare trace of unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed outside, staring at her through the glass,his expression tangled with emotions she couldn&#39;t quite name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the briefest heartbeat, she almost saw the Colin who had once spoiled her without restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The illusion vanished as quickly as it came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley understood better than anyone. He had squandered her love, and now that they had broken up,he regretted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe there lingered a trace of affection,but more than that, he simply couldn&#39;t accept the fact that she was walking away from his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her faint smile slipped. With a quiet word to her employees, Brinley pivoted toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed open the glass door, her expression unreadable. &#34;Mr. Palmer, do you need something from me?&#34; she asked, her tone measured but edged with distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin blinked as if shaken from a daze. He hurriedly held out a paper bag, his voice carrying a hint of nervous hope. &#34;I happened to be nearby and saw this bakery. You used to love their pastries, so I thought I&#39;d bring some for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The logo on the bag belonged to the shop she had once praised endlessly, saying their pastries were flaky, buttery, and just the right kind of sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t reach for it. With a cold shake of her head,she replied, &#34;Thank you, but I don&#39;t eat those anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin&#39;s hand stalled mid-air, the bag crinkling slightly in his grip. Disappointment clouded his eyes for a fleeting second before he forced a polite smile. &#34;I see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let his gaze wander across the open office space,and genuine surprise softened his features. &#34;I didn&#39;t realize your company had grown so much. I thought you were still managing a small studio...&#34; &#34;The place started as nothing more than a cramped little studio,&#34; Brinley said, leaning against the doorframe with her arms loosely folded, her stance carrying a quiet distance. &#34;But little by little, it expanded.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s impressive,&#34; Colin replied, genuine admiration coloring his tone. &#34;I didn&#39;t realize you were so skilledin business,&#34; he added, his gaze steady.&#34;Balancing work while running the company.You&#39;ve put in a lot of effort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint sting tugged at Brinley&#39;s heart, a dull ache rising like an old bruise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, he had no clue. Back then, she had spent her days at the company and her nights locked away in the study, porig over plans and research until the first pale light of dawn crept across her desk.</p>
