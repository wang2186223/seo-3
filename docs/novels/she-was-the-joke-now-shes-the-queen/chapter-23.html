                <p>Brinley trailed Austin into the dining room, her gaze catching on the lavish spread waiting on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Golden-seared foie gras glistened beneath a drizzle of fig sauce, lobster sprawled across a bed of garlic-slick vermicelli, a bowl of pumpkin soup shimmered like liquid velvet, and rosemary-scented lamb chops released a mouthwatering aroma that curled through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every dish looked flawless, a cruel contrast to the charred and oversalted failures she had scraped together in the kitchen over the last few days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin pulled out a chair with deliberate grace,his smile tinged with teasing challenge. &#34;What are you standing there for? Sit down and see for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley sank into the seat with stiff reluctance, hands folding in her lap, the polished silverware left untouched. &#34;I&#39;ll pass. I&#39;m not hungry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried a quiet defiance, her wary eyes fixed on the feast as though it were a carefully baited snare instead of a meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The search in the study had yielded nothing, leaving  kindness he kept showing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just one bite.&#34; Austin slid the utensils back toward her, his tone softening into patient coaxing. &#34;If it&#39;s awful,you can throw the plate at my face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corner of her lips nearly curved at his ridiculous offer, but she caught herself, muffling the spark of laughter with a low, noncommittal hum that served as her reluctant surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers finally curled around the utensils,every motion taut with resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She carved off a sliver of foie gras, pausing so long it seemed she might set it down again, before slipping it past her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crisp shell yielded beneath her bite, releasing a rush of velvety oil that coated her tongue, its butery richness cut with the delicate sweetness of the sauce,surprisingly light instead of cloying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flew wide without her realizing, the flavor still dissolving as her gaze darted over the plate,already hunting her next morsel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never had she imagined Austin could sharpen his culinary craft so dramatically in a matter of days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So?&#34; Austin asked, his smile easy as his gaze lingered on her parted lips. &#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; Brinley mumbled, stubborn pride sharpening her voice-even as her hand betrayed her, fork sliding right back down to snag another bite. She popped it into her mouth, chewing faster this time, like her resolve was unraveling with every savory chew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze strayed to the lobster. That was all it took.Discipline snapped. She reached for it without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After devouring the lobster, she went straight for the pumpkin soup, dipping her spoon in with eager precision. Then came the lamb-sliced into neat pieces, each one polished off in seconds beneath a drizzle of pepper sauce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her puffed cheeks gave her the look of an overeager chipmunk,strangely adorable as she stuffed bite after bite with zero concern for appearances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman who&#39;d insisted she wasn&#39;t hungry now ate with the abandon of someone who hadn&#39;t seen food in days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before her, the feast that once looked curated for royalty was vanishing by the second. She bent over her plate with single-minded devotion, as though nothing existed beyond the flavors claiming her senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from her, Austin remained still, his gaze never leaving her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The amusement in his eyes deepened, watching her stiff resistance melt into uninhibited appetite, her lips glistening with sauce, her eyes alight with unguarded joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long stretch of silent indulgence, she finally raised her head to meet his steady stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color surged to her cheeks. She fumbled for a napkin,nearly knocking over a glass in her flustered haste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Muttering under her breath, she shot him a sidelong glare. &#34;Why are you looking at me like that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin gave a low chuckle and slid a glass of water toward her. &#34;Slow down. It&#39;s not like anyone&#39;s going to snatch it from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley shot him a sharp look, yet still lifted the glass and sipped, hiding her embarrassment behind the rim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she set it down again, her gaze skimmed over the half-empty plates, and warmth rushed to her cheeks-she might have looked like someone who hadn&#39;t eaten in days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess... it&#39;s not terrible,&#34; she muttered, forcing out the reluctant compliment, her ears glowing scarlet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin let the lie pass without comment. Just as he reached for the ladle to serve soup, his phone vibrated sharply against the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at the screen, his expression tightening. In an instant, his voice hardened as he answered. &#34;Have the legal department draw up the papers immediately.I&#39;m on my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended, and he looked at Brinley again, the sternness in his tone replaced by something gentler.&#34;Something urgent came up at the company. I&#39;ll need to step out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Brinley murmured, her eyes drifting back to the lamb chops she&#39;d been carving into tidy slices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin slipped on his suit jacket, pausing at the doorway. He glanced over his shoulder, catching sight of her eating with quiet focus, and the corner of his mouth lifted almost unconsciously. &#34;Take your time and enjoy it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heavy click of the villa&#39;s front door left the room echoing with silence. Alone at the long table, Brinley stared at the untouched dishes, her appetite fading as quickly as it had come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been so certain Austin&#39;s attentiveness carried ulterior motives. Yet now, with him gone, an inexplicable hollowness pressed against her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out a faint sigh, she reached for the bowl of  pumpkin soup he had left untouched. Cradling it between her hands, she tipped it back and drained every drop in one steady motion.</p>
