                <p>As darkness enveloped the night, the villa&#39;s lights dimmed one by one, leaving only the soft amber glow of the second-floor bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin lay awake, the steady rhythm of MAilly&#39;s breathing beside him failing to lull him to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone screen glowed faintly, displaying VantagePath Realty&#39;s website. The homepage showcased Brinley standing confidently by a racetrack, her hair dancing in the breeze, her radiant smile captivating enough to draw every eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gazed at the image for what felt like an eternity before switching off the screen and turning away from Milly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two days later, morning sunlight broke through the clouds, casting a golden hue over the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The groundbreaking ceremony for Brinley&#39;s real estate project buzzed with excitement, colorful banners fluttering and upbeat music filling the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley, dressed in a tailored red suit that accentuated her beautiful presence, took a steadying breath and ascended the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of applause greeted her, and her eyes instinctively swept the crowd, landing on Austin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clad in a casual light gray suit, tie absént and sleeves rolled up, Austin leaned against a railing, his subtle smile radiating quiet support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching her glance, he lifted his water bottle in a small, encouraging gesture, as if to say, &#34;You&#39;ve got this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since their dinner three days prior, when Brinley had decided to try to love him, a delicate tension had simmered between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had braced for awkwardness, but Austin carried on as if her words hadn&#39;t shifted a thing,his natural warmth slowly easing her nerves. Even now, he had come to support her but chose a discreet spot, ensuring he wouldn&#39;t steal her spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His admiring gaze was genuine, free of expectation, allowing her to shine without pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Onstage, Brinley spoke with clarity and conviction, her voice steady as she outlined the project&#39;s vision and goals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile struck a perfect balance-professional yet warm, captivating the audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Below, the crowd brimmed with dignitaries, business partners, and journalists, all hanging on her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s gaze moved gracefully over the attendees, offering subtle nods to key figures, her poise impeccable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin, who had slipped into the crowd unnoticed, stood at the edge, his eyes fixed on the luminous Brinley commanding the stage. His grip tightened on his briefcase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t deny it-Brinley was transforming into something extraordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his memories, she was merely a charming companion, her soft voice and occasional playful outbursts endearing but unremarkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the woman before him now exuded confidence and authority, as if destined to hold the spotlight and command the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also couldn&#39;t ignore her impeccable execution of this project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the initial sketches to securing final approvals and now this flawless ceremony, every detail was perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s ability to secure commitments from notoriously difficult sponsors was nothing short of remarkable.Whatever method she used, she had persuaded them to pour substantial resources into her vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Palmer, Brinley&#39;s influence is growing undeniably stronger,&#34; his assistant whispered. &#34;I&#39;ve heard she&#39;s carving out a solid reputation in the industry, and some heavyweights think highly of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin&#39;s face clouded over, but he remained silent, his jaw tight. Unaware of his boss&#39;s mounting irritation, the assistant pressed on. &#34;At a cocktail party the other night, I caught wind of some chatter about you... but maybe it&#39;s best not torepeat it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did they say?&#34; Colin demanded sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant wavered before reluctantly continuing, &#34;They said you&#39;re clinging to Milly, who&#39;s all charm and no substance, while overlooking a true talent like Brinley. They called it a foolish choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!&#34; Colin barked, his outburst drawing curious stares from nearby onlookers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He inhaled deeply, reining in his anger, and issued a cold directive. &#34;Track down whoever is gossiping about me and teach them a lesson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Mr. Palmer,&#34; the assistant replied, quickly lowering his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Onstage, Brinley wrapped up herspeech with poise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next moment, fireworks burst overhead, and vibrant ribbons swirled through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley joined a group of dignitaries, each gripping a shovel to break ground, her dazzling smile glowing under the sunlight as the cascading ribbons framed her brilliance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin watched her, a heavy pang gripping his chest, as though an invisible weight pressed against his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned and silently slipped away from the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the ceremony, Brinley was swarmed by eager suppliers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she finished speaking with them, her phone buzzed with a message from Austin.&#34;Go easy·on the drinks tonight. I&#39;ll be there to drive you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at the screen, her fingers pausing before typing a brief,&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, the cocktail party buzzed with the clink of glasses, filled with Bleron&#39;s real estate elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley glided through the crowd, a champagne flute in hand, warmly greeting familiar faces and exchanging cards with new contacts. Her demeanor was polished, her words articulate, as she deftly navigated discussions about partnerships and ventures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Moore, you&#39;re truly a promising young woman,&#34; remarked an older executive with silver hair,clinking his glass against hers. &#34;This project has real potential. Let&#39;s talk business soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for your support. I am always open to a conversation,&#34; Brinley replied, her smile radiant with assurance.</p>
