                <p>While Austin spoke, he edged closer to Brinley, their shoulders brushing faintly together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley was speechless, caught off guard by his shameless reasoning, and scooted farther away to put some distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked with a huff, &#34;This bed is huge. Why do you have to squeeze in next to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not squeezing you,&#34; Austin replied with mock innocence.&#34;The bed&#39;s just too small.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley nearly choked. Too small? This bed was much wider than a standard hospital bed. He had to be joking, claiming it was too small.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, she finally realized he was doing it deliberately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She inhaled deeply, deciding the best response was to ignore him. Closing her eyes, she feigned sleep,convinced that if she didn&#39;t engage, he would eventually give up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Austin clearly wasn&#39;t going to let her off that  easily</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, she felt the faint tug of fingers brushing her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quit it,&#34; Brinley muttered without opening her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not my fault,&#34; Austin replied with a quiet laugh. &#34;It was your hair that brushed against me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley lost her patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flew open, and she turned to glare at him.&#34;Austin! What exactly are you trying to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the dim light, his eyes glowed like stars against the night,bright and persistent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at her and, to her frustration, chuckled softly. &#34;Well, I just want to be closer to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was gentle, tinged with something honest and tender. The sound slipped into her heart like a feather on still water, stirring ripples she couldn&#39;t suppress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s heart skidded, her cheeks turning warm at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His bluntness left her flustered, and she instinctively turned her head away. &#34;You&#39;re unbelievable.&#34; She acted irritated, but inside she felt giddy and flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin didn&#39;t press further. He simply watched her in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room grew quiet again, broken only by the whistle of the wind outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Brinley could still feel his deep, intense eyes drilling into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest thudded, her cheeks flushed, and her breaths grew shallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t understand what was wrong with her. She should have been mad at him, but she couldn&#39;t seem to bring herself to. Instead, there was an undercurrent of nervous excitement she couldn&#39;t deny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as her mind wrestled with conflicting emotions,Austin reached out and gently clasped her uninjured hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His palm was warm, his grip steady, carrying a strength that felt protective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley reacted instinctively, trying to pull away as though burned, but Austin only held tighter</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move,&#34; he said softly, his voice low but firm. &#34;Just let me hold it a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingertips brushed lightly against the back of her hand, his touch careful, reverent, as though she were something sacred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s heartbeat instantly stumbled out of sync,and for a moment, she completely forgot to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their closeness magnified everything-the sound of their breathing, the thrum of their heartbeats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley opened her mouth, wanting to speak, but her throat tightened, and no words came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, she let Austin hold her hand, letting the warmth of his palm seep into her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time blurred. Her eyelids grew heavy, her thoughts hazy, until at last sleep pulled her under.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she drifted away, she thought she heard Austin whisper something in her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was faint and dreamlike, the words indistinguishable, but it wrapped her in a sense of safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Brinley slept better than she had in a long time. No nightmares, no sudden awakenings-just the rhythm of Austin&#39;s breathing beside her, comforting as a lullaby. When she woke the following morning, the sunlight was already pouring in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Golden beams slipped through the curtain gaps,scattering warm patterns across the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brinley stirred, she realized she was nestled in Austin&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head rested squarely against his chest, where his heartbeat thumped strong and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of his arms was wrapped securely around her waist,holding her close as though guarding something precious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s face flamed crimson when she realized this.She had actually-unbelievably-slept in his embrace the entire night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had she ended up tangled with him like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been angry with him last night, so how had she surrendered to this closeness in her sleep?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts spun in a chaotic blur, and she instinctively tried to shove him off before he woke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her movement stirred him awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s eyes opened slowly, an amused look on his still-drowsy face as he found her so close. He said in  a voice still rough with sleep, &#34;Good morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath fanned across her forehead, intimate and warm,and her cheeks flared hotter still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Austin! Let go of me!&#34; Brinley squirmed, trying to wriggle free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Austin only tightened his hold, keeping her firmly against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay still,&#34; he muttered, his eyes glinting with playful warmth. &#34;Just let me hold you a little longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley sputtered, equal parts shy and furious, &#34;No way!Let go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin shot back without hesitation, &#34;We&#39;re married.Sleeping in each other&#39;s arms is perfectly normal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley was once again struck silent, unable to counter his logic. She shoved at him with her uninjured hand, but he didn&#39;t budge. If anything, he pulled her tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Austin!&#34; Brinley glared at him, her face burning with exasperation. &#34;If you don&#39;t let go, I&#39;ll pinch you hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t.&#34; Austin smirked, leaning in closer until their noses nearly brushed.</p>
