                <p>In the following days, Austin took on the role of Brinley&#39;s personal chauffeur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One morning, as Brinley finished getting dressed and was about to head to the construction site, she spotted Austin descending the stairs, car keys glinting in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thnought Miguel was supposed to drive me today?&#34;Brinley remarked, tilting her head with a questioning look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She vividly recalled Austin had an international video conference scheduled-one he wasn&#39;t supposed to miss at this hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing the distance, Austin plucked the hard hat smoothly from her hand and answered, &#34;The meeting got pushed back. I&#39;ll take you instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s brow shot up. &#34;You&#39;re bound for the office,and I&#39;m going to the construction site. We&#39;re going in opposite directions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin let out a soft chuckle and brushed a stray lock of her hair back into place. &#34;I&#39;m heading to the    materials market near your site. They just brought in a shipment of imported protective stock. Figured you could use it-and I wanted to check the quality myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone carried quiet conviction, his eyes warm and unwavering, but Brinley was still not convinced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, she chose not to push it and accepted his offer of a ride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding into the Maybach&#39;s passenger seat, she stole a sidelong glance at Austin as he maneuvered the car with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was lost in thought. This was already the fifth time this week he made time to drive her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wherever she needed to go, Austin always had some perfect excuse to offer her a ride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Miguel had gone through the motions of offering her rides, but soon enough he stopped pretending. Now he simply forwarded her schedule straight to Austin and happily enjoyed the extra hours of freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car eased out of the villa gates, gliding smoothly onto the main road. Brinley sat angled toward the window, eyes following the blur of street scenes rushing past, before her curiosity finally spilled out.&#34;Austin, haven&#39;t you been busy lately?&#34; she queried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands stilled on the steering wheel for a fraction of a second. When he glanced at her, the corners of his eyes crinkled with amusement. &#34;Why would you say that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the powerful CEO of Moore Group, yet you&#39;ve been hovering around me all day and acting as my chauffeur. Doesn&#39;t that feel beneath y/ou?&#34; Her tone was laced with humor, but there was a sharp edge of seriousness beneath it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had noticed the way he had trimmed away countless unimportant social obligations, even rearranged his work schedule, all so he could chauffeur her back and forth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attentiveness had gone far beyond the casual habits of most married couples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin let out a low laugh and turned his gaze back to the open road. &#34;Nothing in my world matters more than you do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words sent her pulse skittering, a warmth creeping across her cheeks before she turned sharply toward the window, pretending she hadn&#39;t heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the odd sensation lingered, like a pebble dropped into calm water, ripples spreading endlessly inside her chest. When the car rolled to a stop at the site entrance,she unfastened her seatbelt, ready to step out. Austin&#39;s hand closed gently around her wrist, halting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll pick you up tonight,&#34; he said, his gaze steady and full of intent. &#34;We&#39;ll have dinner at a restaurant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need. I might be stuck working late...&#34;Brinley murmured hesitantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Late or not, you still have to eat,&#34; Austin cut in, his tone firm, the kind that left no room for refusal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley bit back the refusal poised on her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawn into Austin&#39;s gaze as though something unseen held her there, she finally gave a small nod. &#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With deliberate slowness, Austin let her hand slip free,his eyes glinting with sly triumph. &#34;Go on. Take good care of yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the door, stepped out, slipped on her hard hat, and set off toward the construction site.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her footsteps carried her forward, instinct made her glance back. Austin&#39;s car still idled where she&#39;d left it, his window rolled down, his eyes fixed on her with a soft, lingering smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their gazes locked, and her chest gave a sharp,  unsteady thump. Flustered, she spun back around and quickened her pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That warmth of his stare clung to her skin, steady and unyielding, until she stepped onto the site and it vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the temporary boardroom. Brinley leaned against the wall, pressing her palms to her flushed cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get a grip, Brinley! Now&#39;s not the time to be lovestruck!&#34; she reminded herself firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The project was teetering at a crucial point,and with the exhibition race looming, the weight of unfinished work pressed down on her from every direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By six o&#39;clock, Austin&#39;s car waited at the construction site entrance, headlights glowing faintly through the drizzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley had intended to work overtime, but under his quiet insistence, she had no choice but to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slanted drops rattled against the windows.Inside the car, Austin sat with a document in hand, his profile softened by the dim interior light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brinley slipped inside, her damp hair clung to her temples, carrying a chill from the rain. Without hesitation, Austin passed her a folded towel.&#34;Here, dry yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She accepted it, blotting her hair as she glanced sideways at him. &#34;So, where are we having dinner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Starting the engine, Austin steered smoothly onto the road. &#34;There&#39;s a new restaurant on the north side.After that,we&#39;ll head over to the racetrack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley hesitated, her head tilting as she studied him.&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s voice carried a quiet certainty. &#34;Your car was wrecked, remember? I had a new one brought in for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers stilled mid-motion, and she sat frozen,staring at him in stunned silence. The moment stretched until Austin chuckled softly and tapped her forehead with a light flick of his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That little gesture broke her daze. She finally nodded,murmuring, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The restaurant he chose was tucked away in a quiet corner of the city, refined and discreet, its atmosphere hushed and elegant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The food was exquisite, every dish distinct and bursting with flavor. Brinley ate until her hunger was satisfied, her usual guarded expression softening as her eyes lingered on Austin, warmth slipping into her gaze.</p>
