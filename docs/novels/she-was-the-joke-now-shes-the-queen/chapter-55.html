                <p>Brinley offered Colin a measured smile, her tone laced with sarcasm. &#34;Mr. Palmer, you make a valid point.But in the end, expertise is the solid ground beneath it all. If we can&#39;t guarantee a safe track, then all the dazzling operations are nothing more than hollow talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words landed cleanly, drawing a firm nod from Grayson. &#34;Mrs. Moore, you&#39;re absolutely right. Safety always comes first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin&#39;s face hardened, though he chose not to push back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him, Milly&#39;s nails dug into the silk of her dress as she watched Brinley sit at the center of attention,confidently exchanging ideas with seasoned professionals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pang twisted in her chest. She, too, had once envisioned herselfin that role-tailored suit, commanding voice, admired in a boardroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet reality had stripped her of that dream, leaving her seated quietly at Colin&#39;s side, reduced to nothing more than a decorative companion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Envy coiled tight around Milly&#39;s chest like a strangling vine, squeezing the air from her lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell had Brinley ever done to deserve all this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was Brinley allowed to shine so brightly after leaving Colin, while she herself, no matter how fiercely she clawed forward, was still trapped in the shadows of others?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the meeting wrapped, Grayson gave his nod to Brinley&#39;s proposal, leaving Colin&#39;s face stiff with suppressed anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trailing after Colin, Milly slowed her steps, and as they crossed paths with Brinley, she gave a sharp shoulder bump,leaning close to hiss, &#34;Don&#39;t get cocky. This project won&#39;t fall into your hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley didn&#39;t bother answering. Her calm gaze followed Milly&#39;s retreating figure with a detached coolness. She let out a cold sneer. Milly never understood that schemes couldn&#39;t replace skill-true success came from ability, not manipulation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin laid a steady hand on Brinley&#39;s shoulder,his touch grounding her.&#34;Come on,&#34; he murmured, voice warm against the undercurrent of tension.&#34;Let&#39;s go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The city lights streaked past the car windows, and Brinley let her head fall back against the seat,weariness settling deep into her bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This endless tug-of-war, hidden barbs and polite facades, drained her more than any sleepless night spent hunched over design drafts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You handled yourself well just now,&#34; Austin finally said, breaking the heavy quiet. His tone carried a hint of pride. &#34;Far more professional than I expected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came prepared,&#34; Brinley murmured, pressing her fingertips against her aching temples. &#34;But Colin&#39;s team is formidable. The real contest hasn&#39;t even begun-it&#39;s going to be brutal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin turned his gaze toward her, warmth flickering in his eyes. &#34;With me here, you have nothing to be afraid of. Even if the project slips away in the end, it&#39;Il still sharpen your skills.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sincerity etched across his profile stirred something inside her, an unexpected warmth that spread through her tired heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the next few days, her routine blurred into relentless cycles-dawn departures, late-night returns, and hardly a moment left to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin saw to it that Miguel brought her food and stayed until she ate every bite, knowing how easily she forgot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her design draft gradually took shape, yet with the bidding deadline loomning,it still remained incomplete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unwilling to lose focus, she told Austin she would be staying at the office and buried herself in the work for several days straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three straight mornings passed with Brinley waking up at her desk. Shafts of crooked light pierced through the blinds, casting fractured shadows on the half-finished racetrack layout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had slipped into slumber in her chair, pen still in hand from the night before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her weary fingers skimmed the touchpad, but the section linking the track to the commercial hub stayed stubbornly blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That unresolved problem had pressed on her chest like a stone for three relentless days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley, the track material samples you asked for just arrived,&#34; Corbin announced as he entered, lugging several hefty folders. His eyes widenedat the sight of her slumped at the desk. &#34;You... stayed here all night again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley pressed her aching temples, her voice rasping as she admitted, &#34;Yeah... the connection design has me stuck.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gestured toward the glaring red question mark flashing on the monitor. &#34;The track&#39;s drainage system keeps clashing with the commercial district&#39;s underground network. I&#39;ve revised it eight times already, and the balance still won&#39;t hold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Corbin laid the folders on the desk and offered her a cup of warm milk. &#34;You&#39;ve been running on empty for three days.Why not head home and rest a little? Inspiration might come easier after some sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley shook her head and instead lifted her coffee, letting the bitterness sharpen her foggy mind.&#34;No need. The final draft is due in just a few days. If I cave now, all of our work will collapse with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snatched up a marker and began sketching alternate pipeline routes across the blueprint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faint rasp of the pen against paper cut through the stillness of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet midway through, her hand slowed again, the tip of the marker hovering uselessly over the page.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how she rerouted it, the sewage lines from the commercial district still cut straight across the racetrack&#39;s foundation. Left unresolved, the overlap would one day cause the ground to sink-a fatal flaw for any professional circuit. &#34;Damn it!&#34; With a sharp tug, she raked her fingers through her hair and flung the pen onto the table,watching it spin before clattering to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For days, she had been living at the office, too pressed for time to go home. Austin&#39;s messages piled up unanswered, her replies delayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was well aware she&#39;d been giving him too little of her time, but the looming deadline left her no choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, the door eased open with a soft creak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Assuming it was Corbin, she didn&#39;t bother to glance up. &#34;Just leave the samples on the desk. I&#39;ll look them over later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet silence followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in confusion, she looked up and halted mid-motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin filled the doorway in a sleek black suit, a manila envelope tucked under his arm, his gaze lingering on the bloodshot haze in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; she blurted, scrambling to straighten the chaos of her desk, but didn&#39;t know where to start.</p>
