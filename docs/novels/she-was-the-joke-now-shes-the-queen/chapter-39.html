                <p>Austin let out a low chuckle, the sound carrying both resignation and a quiet fondness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, the room slipped into heavy silence,without the faintest rustle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley,though,remained wide awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sensed he hadn&#39;t stretched out beside her again, as if he were still seated nearby, his eyes lingering on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting him to know she was still awake, she held her rigid posture, her thoughts spinning aimlessly into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he watching her so intently? Could it truly be that Austin harbored a weakness for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley pictured Austin dusted in flour as he stubbornly tried to master cooking, the steady calm in his face while he swallowed down her disastrous attempts at a meal, and the ghostly pallor when he endured the pain of gastrointestinal bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those snapshots flickered through her mind like a reel of film, and her pulse stumbled, racing faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To everyone else, Austin was decisive, relentless, a man carved from steel-yet before her, he revealed a tenderness that seemed to exist nowhere else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought stirred unease. Maybe she was reading too much into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps it wasn&#39;t affection at all, but simply that Austin had never been close to a woman before.Suddenly bound by marriage, he might only be treating her kindly out of obligation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their union had cemented the two families together,and she reasoned that so long as he posed no real danger to her, she was content to continue the marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for what lay ahead-they would just take things step by cautious step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s thoughts meandered until the faint glow of dawn finally softened her mind into a shallow sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she stirred again, the space beside her was already vacant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunlight poured in through the tall windows, spilling golden streaks across the polished floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out on the balcony, Austin stood with a phone pressed to his ear, his lean, imposing frame outlined by the light. The dark gray pajamas he wore only sharpened his aura of quiet authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she watched his back, Westley&#39;s words from the night before echoed in her memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley, you may not know this, but Austin&#39;s mother left the very day after he was born. He never experienced a mother&#39;s love. That&#39;s why he seems cold and distant. But he&#39;s soft on the inside; he just doesn&#39;t know how to connect with people. You&#39;re his wife, so try to endure. If he ever mistreats you, tell me-I&#39;ll make sure he&#39;s taught a lesson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, she had acknowledged with a smile, though something complicated twisted inside her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Learning Austin had grown up in such a cold, barren household suddenly explained why he buried his emotions so deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Brinley couldn&#39;t help but question-was the Austin she knew truly as detached as Westley described?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the same man who had fumbled his way through cooking just to please her, eaten every poorly prepared dish she put on the table without a word of complaint, and stood quietly at her side when his family made things difficult for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed nothing like the person that Westley had described.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are awake.&#34; Austin ended the call and turned with a faint curve to his lips. &#34;Go freshen up.Breakfast&#39;s ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley gave a small nod, slipped out of bed, and hurried toward the bathroom. In the mirror, she caught sight of the faint shadows beneath her eyes-evidence of the sleepless night she had endured.</p>
