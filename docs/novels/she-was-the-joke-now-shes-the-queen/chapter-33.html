                <p>Austin set down the gift box in his hand and glanced at Brinley. &#34;You really don&#39;t need to go to so much trouble. It&#39;s fine if you don&#39;t prepare gifts for my family; they wouldn&#39;t mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you say that?&#34; Brinley immediately straightened her back, meeting his gaze with resolve.&#34;It&#39;s my first time visiting your family. I can&#39;t risk seeming impolite. What if they think I lack proper manners and that I&#39;m not good enough for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her seriousness made a soft warmth rise in Austin&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That won&#39;t happen,&#34; he said calmly. &#34;As long as I&#39;m with you, no one will dare utter a word against you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conviction in his eyes melted the anxiety in Brinley&#39;s heart. Before their departure for the Moore Estate, Brinley twirled once in front of the full-length wardrobe mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was wearing just casual wear, but her natural beauty and elegance made it impossible for her to look plain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Moore, all the gifts have been taken into the car,&#34; the butler announced at the doorway, a list of items in his hands. &#34;Would you like to confirm them again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley had already gone over the list more than five times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had spent days choosing every single gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need,&#34; she replied, taking the list from him. The anxiety left her palms cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew the presents were extravagant, perhaps even excessive, but she would not risk being belittled on her first visit, nor would she allow Austin to lose face because of her. Outside, Austin&#39;s car waited at the entrance of the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore a charcoal grey suit patterned with subtle designs, which emphasized his tall frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brinley stepped out, Austin grinned with admiration. He held the door for her. &#34;You look stunning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley blushed, feeling self-conscious, and she quickly slipped into thecar.&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the vehicle rolled away from the villa, Brinley turned to glance at the van following behind, filled with the gifts she had carefully chosen one by one over the last several days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She inhaled deeply, silently encouraging herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Moore Estate lay in the eastern suburbs of Bleron, nestled halfway up a hill, surrounded by thick camphor trees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the car window, Brinley watched it draw closer,her fingertips curling slightly with unease. &#34;Don&#39;t be afraid,&#34; Austin muttered beside her, taking her slightly cold hand in his. &#34;I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley turned her head toward him. Sunlight spilled through the window, tracing gentle shadows across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was grateful for his comfort, yet she couldn&#39;t help but feel anxious. The Moore family was vast and complicated; remembering names and faces alone would be a challenge, let alone dealing with the hidden rivalries and alliances beneath polite smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car pulled up, and the great iron gates swung open from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An elderly man, clearly the family&#39;s butler, stood at the front with a row of servants lined neatly behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leading them was Austin&#39;s eldest brother, Byron Moore, dressed in a dark blue suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Austin, we&#39;ve been waiting for you,&#34; Byron said warmly. He glanced between Austin and Brinley before gesturing toward her. &#34;And this must be Brinley? Please, come inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley followed Austin through the grand entrance.As they crossed the corridor, she noticed a handful of figures lurking behind the pillars, peeking at them curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among them stood a woman in a designer suit,whispering to a young man while stealing glances at Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to Miguel&#39;s notes, Brinley quickly identified her: Carolyn Moore, wife of Ryder Moore, Austin&#39;s second oldest brother. Standing beside her was her son,Corbett Moore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living room was already packed with people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the center, seated in the main seat, was an older man with silvering hair-Westley Moore, the patriarch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To his side sat Austin&#39;s oldest sister, Briseis Moore,elegant in a refined dress. &#34;Dad.&#34; Austin approached Westley, nodding slightly in greeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley moved to follow with her own greeting, but before she could speak, Carolyn shrieked, &#34;Oh? So this is Austin&#39;s new wife? She certainly looks young.But I heard she was married before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After she spoke, the room seemed to freeze instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Westley frowned but said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley had stopped smiling, turning to respond to Carolyn. But Austin beat her to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by that, Carolyn?&#34; His voice was menacing. He added firmly, &#34;Brinley is my wedded wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carolyn stiffened with embarrassment, forcing a smile. &#34;Austin, I only meant it out of concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need for your concern,&#34; Austin replied,guiding Brinley to an empty seat. &#34;We handle our own affairs.&#34; The room settled into an awkward silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carolyn, feeling rebuked, pursed her lips and didn&#39;t dare push further. In her mind, she dismissed his defense as nothing more than pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their marriage had been a family arrangemnent,after all; how much real affection could there be? Austin had always been aloof with women; how could he possibly care deeply for Brinley so soon?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others remained quiet as well, each harboring their own thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carolyn simmered with resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Briseis who finally broke the tension.&#34;Come now, we&#39;re all family. That&#39;s enough. Brinley, since it&#39;s your first time here, try the coffee I just brewed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley lifted her cup politely. Being naturally discerning, she could already tell that this gathering would be a challenge to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After only a short round of pleasantries, she signaled for the servants to bring in the prepared gifts. Soon, over a dozen beautifully wrapped boxes were carried in and arranged neatly in the corner, ddrawing everyone&#39;s attention at once.</p>
