                <p>&#34;Great.&#34; Austin nodded, then gave a soft, fleeting smile, so fleeting it was almost as though Brinley had imagined it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt her heart thud unexpectedly as she watched him go up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His decision to personally cook for her and his insistence on visiting the Shaw family made her confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man like Austin was supposed to be distant and restrained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he suddenly paying so much attention to these trivial things?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley frowned, lost in her thoughts. She knew that,when things didn&#39;t add up, there was usually a hidden reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What exactly was Austin&#39;s reason for this unusual attentiveness?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was there some secret in the Moore family that she didn&#39;t know about? Or was there some hidden scheme?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light at the stairway corner cast his shadow long and dark against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley squinted as she stared at that silhouette,growing suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, once she was back in her room, she fell asleep at once, forgetting her suspicions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever plans Austin might be making, the Shaw family was not one he could toy with. If he dared to target them, he wouldn&#39;t regret it. 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Brinley headed to the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the past three months, she had been building her own company, VantagePath Realty, a firm operating in the same sector as the Palmer Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mere thought of Colin, Brinley&#39;s face scrunched up with displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since he had chosen deceit over loyalty, then he needed to be ready to pay the price. She intended to crush his pride in the field he valued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The days that followed left Brinley with no time to dwell on Austin. Her hours were consumed by preparations for the company&#39;s business proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin, havig only recently returned to the country,was also tied up with business. During this period, Colin tried repeatedly to seek Brinley out, but she never once agreed to see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Bleron&#39;s new development zone, a major commercial complex was about to open up for bids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The potential profits were enormous, drawing the attention of countless companies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Palmer Group had spent a full year laying groundwork for this project, with Colin personally overseeing preparations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This very project had played a significant role in Brinley&#39;s decision to return to Bleron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aware of this, Austin discreetly instructed his assistant to forward her the latest information on city planning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Brinley sat at her desk, revising her proposal on the computer screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spread out in front of her were the most recent land assessment reports.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Shaw, the final version of the bid presentation is ready,&#34; an employee said, handing her a stack of documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley accepted them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help recalling the two years she had spent with Colin; their so-called marriage had been nothing but a scam. The memory made her lips curl into a cold smnile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her phone buzzed. It was a message from Austin. &#34;I&#39;ve arranged for my assistant to be at the bidding venue. If you need anything, just reach out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s reply was curt. &#34;No need. I can manage it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting the phone facedown on the desk,she returned to the proposal before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the top-floor conference room at Palmer Group headquarters, Colin sat restlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For days, he had tried every possible way to get close to Brinley, yet he hadn&#39;t managed to see her once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with the bid drawing near, he had no choice but to return for this crucial meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This project will be Palmer Group&#39;s highest priority over the next three years,&#34; Colin said to the board members. &#34;The development district director has already acknowledged that our proposal is in close alignment with the city&#39;s long-term planning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several board members nodded in agreement. The marketing director added confidently, &#34;Mr. Palmer,we&#39;ve already poured thirty million into the land assessment. Our network and connections are firmly established.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin gave a small nod, quite relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flashed a self-assured smile as he glanced around the room. &#34;Palmer Group is set on winning this project.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was then that someone remarked, &#34;By the way,I heard Brinley has registered a company called VantagePath Realty and is preparing to bid as well.And now that she&#39;s Austin&#39;s wife,she might carry more weight than expected...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendees were all aware of what had happened at the Knight family&#39;s banquet, and the complicated history between Colin and Brinley was hardly a secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every eye flicked toward Colin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled dismissively. &#34;Relax. She&#39;s just an ordinary woman. What could she possibly know about real estate development? Most likely, that company of hers is nothing but a shell she set up on a whim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the thought of Brinley made him shiver slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She always shows up wherever I am. Perhaps she&#39;s just trying to get my attention again,&#34; he said lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the executives heard this, they relaxed. They were well aware of how Brinley had once defied her family for Colin. Somehow, she was now Austin&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all believed there was more to the story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, as long as she didn&#39;t threaten the Palmer Group&#39;s grip on the project, they had no reason to be concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three days later, the bidding venue buzzed with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin sat in the front row, speaking in low tones with the development district director, but his eyes kept straying toward the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was waiting for Brinley.</p>
