                <p>The last streaks of sunset stained the horizon in shades of gold and rose as Brinley slipped away from the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out her phone, she typed a crisp order to Corbin. &#34;Have the tech team prepare the patent certificate for the new material and get it posted on the company site.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His answer came in seconds, punctuated with a playful cheer emoji.&#34;On it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she already suspected who had stirred up trouble, Brinley chose not to stew over it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly&#39;s petty maneuvers weren&#39;t worth a battle now, not when the stakes were higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Brinley&#39;s mind, schemes and shortcuts could never outlast real ability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the matter settled, she headed back to Hillcrest Villa, arriving just as the clock struck six, the twilight air still warm against he skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin lounged in the living room, waiting for her return, the aroma of dinner already drifting from the neatly arranged table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rough day?&#34; he asked in an even voice as he rose to take her bag from her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley shook her head, easing into her chair and tasting the soup. The delicate sweetness washed over her tongue,comforting enough to melt away the day&#39;s weariness. &#34;Nothing serious-it&#39;s all handled now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t press. Instead, he reached for the tablet she had set aside, his gaze scanning the clarification statement posted on the website.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the design sketches caught his eye, a flicker of admiration softened his expression. &#34;This concept is brilliant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face brightened instantly.&#34;&#34;You think so? I worried it might be too bold for the judges.&#34;&#34;True design never shies from boldness.&#34; He set the tablet down and met her gaze with quiet certainty.&#34;You&#39;ve had a long day. Get some rest after you finish your soup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Brinley drained the last of her soup, set the spoon aside, and quietly made her way upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin lingered át the table, his gaze following her until she vanished down the hall. A faint smile softened his features, warmth flickeing in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodnight,&#34; he murmured after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She faltered on the steps, hesitated for a heartbeat, yet chose silence instead of answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the eve of the big presenation, rain drifted lightly over Bleron, misting the streets in a silver haze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s study glowed softly under the solitary lamp, shadows stretching across shelves lined with books.Rain pattered steadily against the vast panes of glass, a quiet counterpoint to her hushed rehearsal for tomorrow&#39;s presentation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The third cup of coffee sat abandoned on the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her fingers reached absentmindedly for it, they brushed against unexpected warmth-a bowl that hadn&#39;t been there before. She flinched slightly, startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too much iced coffee will ruin your stomach.&#34; Austin&#39;s low murmur came from above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her gaze, she found him standing there in cream-colored loungewear, an empty tray balanced in his hand,the porridge still steaming faintly beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you still awake?&#34; she asked softly, her eyes lingering on the shadows beneath his lashes,a faint ache tugging at her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, Austin had made a point of returning home earlier, yet his nights stretched long in the study, pages and screens keeping him company until dawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was waiting for you,&#34; he murmured, dragging a chair closer before settling beside her. His gaze swept over her pale face. &#34;You must be worn out.&#34; &#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; Brinley gave a weak shake of her head, unable to hold it upright for long. &#34;I keep thinking, what if...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no &#39;what if&#39;&#34; Austin cut in, his voice steady, his eyes unwavering. &#34;The plan you&#39;ve drawn up is already more than enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t even make it to the last page.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need to,&#34; he replied in a low, steady tone. &#34;The way you spent night after night fine-tuning every parameter told me enough-you were destined to win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s head snapped up and her heart warmed at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By then, the rain outside had slipped away unnoticed, leaving the moon to break through a ragged veil of clouds. Its pale glow spilled across the design sheet in Austin&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This concept is daring,&#34; he murmured, brushing a fingertip over the sketched lines. &#34;But it has something magnetic about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Magnetic?&#34; Brinley arched a brow, a trace of challenge in her voice. &#34;What if they say it isn&#39;t professional?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Professionalism isn&#39;t about clinging to rigid rules,&#34; Austin said, lifting his eyes to hers, his voice steady but warm. His gaze carried a depth that softened the edges of his words. &#34;Real mastery lies in blending contradictions until they feel like harmony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s chest tightened as she met the sincerity in his eyes, and something long knotted inside her seemed to loosen at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dropped her gaze to her lap, fingers twisting together, and whispered,&#34;Austin... what if I don&#39;t win this project?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the words slipped out, regret stabbed through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never exposed her fears, never cracked her armor-but tonight, with Austin watching her so intently,the anxieties she had buried for days refused to stay hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This project wasn&#39;t just another stepping stone; it was the culmination of endless hours and relentless determination. She had poured herself into every detail. The thought of falling short-of all her sacrifices ending in disappointment-was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin sat in silence, letting the air stretch before he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for the glass on the table and held it out to her with steady hands.&#34;Here.Drink this first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley accepted it, her fingertips brushing against the warm surface, and a faint calm seeped through her restless chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to force it.&#34; His voice was low yet firm, threaded with quiet authority. &#34;If this project slips by,wait for the next one. Your ability will eventually shine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on her tired face, exhaustion from too many sleepless nights evident in her features. With a gentler edge, he continued, &#34;But Brinley... to me, your health matters more than any deal. Losing one project isn&#39;t the end of the world. I&#39;llstand behind you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words flowed from his lips with such effortless ease, as if they were the most natural truth in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, they made Brinley&#39;s heart stumble in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warm water slid down her throat, coating it with a faint comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head toward the moon outside the window, her voice rough as she muttered, &#34;I never asked you to support me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin gave a low laugh, eyes glinting. &#34;I know you didn&#39;t. I just want to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley pressed her cheek against the cool surface of the table, retreating into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after a long pause did she lift her head again, eyes rimmed red yet curved with a small smile.&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
