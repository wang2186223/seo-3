                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, doesn&#39;t hurt a bit,&#34; Brinley murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tenderness in Austin&#39;s touch unsettled her, leaving her strangely restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bent his head lower, treating the shallow red mark on her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slant of lamplight traced shadows along his dark lashes, softening the severity of his profile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the distant chirping of crickets through the open window broke the silence in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley studied the lines of his face, her chest tightening with emotions too tangled to name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His concern for her had always expressed itself this way-not with words, but with quiet, steadfast action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin packed away the first-aid kit and returned to the sofa, offering her a steaming cup of water.&#34;Drink this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley accepted it, the warmth sliding down her dry throat like comfort itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she glanced up, his eyes were already fixed on her, steady and penetrating, as though he could read every secret she carried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You handle a car impressively,&#34; he said suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers twitched, and the cup nearly slipped from her grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to appear calm, she placed the cup back on the table and avoided his gaze. &#34;It&#39;s nothing. I trained for a while, so I can manage when things get tricky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; His tone remained calm, almost flat, &#34;Even seasoned racers might not have pulled off a drift like the one you did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s mind detonated at his words, leaving her stunned. He really had seen it-her reckless, nearly unhinged drift through the deserted warehouse district.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pulse thundered in her ears, sweat dampening her palms as panic pressed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What excuse could she possibly offer?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she brush it off as nothing more than sheer luck?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a coincidence,&#34; Brinley muttered, her throat tightening as she kept her eyes lowered. &#34;I dabbled in it a long time ago. When the moment came, my hands just...reacted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a word came from Austin; only his calm, unrelenting stare bore into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That quiet scrutiny felt like an invisible net, leaving her trapped without a way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The longer he studied her, the more flustered she became, and even she knew how flimsy her excuse sounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why were you even there?&#34; Brinley finally blurted, forcing herself to look up, desperate to shift the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin ignored her question, his voice cool and direct. &#34;Who do you think is pulling the strings behind those tailing you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley froze, her mind flashing back to the black car and the masked figures inside. She gave a small shake of her head. &#34;I&#39;m not sure. Could be competitors trying to dig into project details. Or maybe...&#34; She hesitated, then forced the words out. &#34;Maybe they&#39;re after you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given Austin&#39;s tangled family ties, filled-with constant rivalries and hidden wars, the thought didn&#39;t seem far-fetched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s jaw tightened as he reached for his phone.&#34;Miguel will handle the investigation. Until then, don&#39;t step out alone. I&#39;ll assign bodyguards to stay with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need that. I...&#34; Brinley&#39;s refusal camne instinctively, the idea of being shadowed by his peopl.e making her frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do,&#34; Austin cut her off, his voice firm and final, making it clear there was no room to argue.&#34;Unless you&#39;d rather have me personally drive you to and from work every single day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes carried a gravity that allowed no refusal, a firm edge that left no space for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley studied the taut lines of his face, realizing he meant every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His concern for her safety wasn&#39;t just spoken-it weighed on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth that rose in her chest came laced with a faint sting of helplessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She parted her lips to speak but, in the end, only gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pleased with her compliance, Austin tucked the first-aid kit back into place and straightened to his full height. &#34;It&#39;s late. Go shower and get some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm,&#34; Brinley answered softly, almost under her breath. She rose from the sofa and quietly made her way toward the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside her bedroom, she closed the door and leaned back against it, one hand pressed over her thundering heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t tell how much Austin had actually witnessed, but she wasn&#39;t ready for him to know too much about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, she knew almost nothing about him, much less why he cared for her with such intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, she hadn&#39;t bothered to question it, never curious enough to pry. Now, though, she realized the time had come for a candid conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hot water streamed over her in the shower, easingthe tension wound tight in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she emerged, steam trailing after her, she noticed a glass of warm milk waiting on her nightstand with a folded note beside it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The handwriting was unmistakably Austin&#39;s. &#34;Drink the milk before bed-it&#39;ll help you sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley hesitated before lifting the glass, sipping the milk in slow, careful swallows. The warmth slid down her throat and settled in her stomach, easing her tension bit by bit. Later, stretched across the bed, she stared at the silvered moonlight streaming through the window, finding herself restless in a way she hadn&#39;t been before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the study, Austin lingered at the window, eyes fixed on the glow of her room until it finally went dark. Only then did he pull out his phone, his voice low and clipped as he instructed, &#34;Miguel, look into Brinley&#39;s past.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By noon the next day, their lunch appointment had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley lingered at home far too long, forcing herself into a brisk walk so she wouldn&#39;t be late. She managed to sip through the restaurant&#39;s doors at the very last minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a long-standing eatery in Bleron, a place Austin was rumored to visit every so often.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley had reserved a private room ahead of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she pushed open the wooden door, she found Austin already waiting inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He worea light gray shirt with the sleeves casually rolled up, showing the smooth lines of his wrists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His whole demeanor seemed far more at ease than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted his eyes to her, his gaze lingering on her face for several seconds.</p>
