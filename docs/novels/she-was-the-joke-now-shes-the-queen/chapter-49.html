                <p>In her mind, the thunder of engines returned,vibrating through her chest as vividly as if she were already standing trackside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the sleek black car finally rolled past the ornate gates of the villa&#39;s neighborhood, her eyes caught a tall figure waiting at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin stood motionless in a tailored gray suit, the iron gates behind him, his steady gaze locked on the approaching vehicle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley slammed the brakes, and as the window slid down, his calm yet commanding presence seemed to sweep into the car with the evening air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ignored my calls.&#34; Austin&#39;s voice stayed even,but his gaze cut straight through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I was tied up,&#34; Brinley hurriedly explained, unfastening her seatbelt. She shoved the car door open, clutching the freshly printed project packet so tightly the corners had already crumpled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s eyes dropped to the stack in her hands, his brows drawing together. &#34;The government&#39;s racing-themed complex project?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve heard about it too?&#34; A spark leapt into Brinley&#39;s eyes. She thrust the documents toward him with both hands. &#34;Look at this-an FIA Grade 2 circuit layout, a themed hotel designed around racing culture. This project is so me! It&#39;s a perfect fit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words tumbled out of her in a rush, her cheeks tinged pink with excitement, completely oblivious to the softness in Austin&#39;s eyes as he watched her glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re really passionate about this?&#34; Austin pressed, flipping the packet open. His fingers lingered on the bold phrase &#34;racing-themed,&#34; his voice steady but laced with curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Passionate doesn&#39;t even cover it.&#34; Brinley&#39;s voice rang with conviction. &#34;This is the chance our company needs to rise again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint flicker of surprise crossed his features before his composure returned. &#34;So you&#39;re planning to bid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Without question,&#34; she answered with a firm nod,her tone resolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin flipped open the terms page and discovered that the design proposal needed to be submitted within three months. His brow lifted as he muttered,&#34;That&#39;s a brutal timeline. Besides, there&#39;s so much tied up in it. Government permits, sponsor coordination, motorsport certifications-your company alone can&#39;t shoulder all that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it won&#39;t be easy.&#34; Fixing her gaze on him,Brinley&#39;s voice rang with fierce, unwavering grit.&#34;But after the last project collapsed, we need a milestone to prove we can stand tall again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Want my help?&#34; Austin shut the folder, his expression suddenly intent. &#34;Moore Group has a team that knows every corner of this system-the government, the association. I can line up the funding anytime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He delivered it with a quiet authority, as if summoning an army of resources were no more difficult than flipping a switch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of warmth spread through Brinley&#39;s chest.With Austin&#39;s backing, the project would be hers for the taking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, she shook her head. &#34;No need. I appreciate it though.&#34; Drawing in a breath, she met his gaze with clear, unyielding eyes. &#34;I need to do this on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arching a brow, he queried, &#34;And why&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because this company is mine-it&#39;s my battleground.&#34; Locking onto his gaze without flinching, Brinley&#39;s voice carried a sharp conviction.&#34;The Moore Group is powerful, and your network is unmatched-I&#39;m well aware. But I refuse to spend my life buried in another&#39;s shadow. Confidence is forged with every project you see through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentler note slipped into her tone, yet the strength in her words remained resolute. &#34;I don&#39;t want people to remember me only as Austin&#39;s wife or the Shaw family&#39;s daughter. I want them to say Brinley stands out, and so does her company.&#34; The breeze stirred her hair, strands brushing against her cheek, while the last streaks of sunset spilled across her shouders like a crown of gold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin studied the pride and unshakable will in her eyes, instantly recalling that scene at the Moore Estate when she stood her ground against Ryder and his family, cutting down their provocation with a sharp,fearless rebuttal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley had never been the kind of woman who hid behind others. She carried her own defenses, her own foundation, and a vision for what she wanted to achieve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; He fixed his eyes on her. &#34;This project is riddled with hidden traps, and there are powerful players moving in the shadows. On your own,you...&#34; &#34;I&#39;m not on my own,&#34; Brinley swiftly cut him off with a confident curve of her lips. &#34;I have my team, my skills,and...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flicked to him, softening as she added with quiet certainty, &#34;And Austin, you&#39;re also standing behind me, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
