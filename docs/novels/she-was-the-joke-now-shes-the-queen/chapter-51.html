                <p>&#34;No worries, I&#39;ll take a break after I get through this bit,&#34; Brinley replied, dabbing at her forehead but never breaking her focus on the ridgeline ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed as she went on, &#34;This slope&#39;s sharper than our initial survey showed. If we don&#39;t adjust the track layout, it could become a safety hazard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not until the sun reached its brutal peak-scorching the soil until heat shimmered off the ground-did she finally lead her team into the shade of the hastily erected shed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Corbin helped pop open Brinley&#39;s thermos, and a rich fragrance of broth and steamed egg instantly drifted through the air. Inside was a hearty soup, thick with warmth, and two smooth eggs nestled at the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes brightened as he leaned closer. &#34;Mr. Moore made this for you? It smells incredible.&#34; Brinley lifted the spoon and took a careful sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heat lingered on her tongue, chasing away the fatigue that had been dragging her down for days.With each mouthful, the tension in her chest began to ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her eat, Corbin tore into his bread and grinned. &#34;The two of you really have it good. He looks out for you in every detail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley laughed softly, the corners of her eyes curving with amusement. &#34;Don&#39;t twist it into something tender. He just doesn&#39;t want me to starve to death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words carried a joking edge, yet she never slowed her pace, polishing off every last drop of soup until the bowl was empty.</p>
