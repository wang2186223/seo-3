                <p>Brinley slammed the door shut and slumped against it,dragging in shaky breaths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, she forced herself into the bathroom and splashed cold water over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reflection staring back had flushed cheeks and wide,unsettled eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her palm pressed against her chest, as if she could slow the frantic pounding beneath her ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no denying it-any woman would have been shaken by that kind of lethal charm and physique.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin knew exactly what he was doing. He reveled in watching her lose composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley shook her head hard, as if she could scatter the tangled thoughts clouding her mind. Sleep didn&#39;t come easily; she tossed and turned before exhaustion finally pulled her under.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With tomorrow&#39;s business gala ahead, she knew she had to get some decent sleep. Since walking away from Colin, she had come to understand a hard truth-no man&#39;s affection could rival the pull of ambition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A career&#39;s triumph was far more intoxicating than fleeting romance. She had vowed to shape her own destiny, never again sacrificing her future for love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following evening, the business gala unfolded beneath dazzling chandeliers, the glow casting the hall in the splendor of a grand ballroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley arrived in a custom black mermaid gown,sequins along the hem scattering light with each graceful step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she made her debut as CEO of VantagePath Realty,her polished makeup and composed elegance seized every glance in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guest list brimmed with Bleron&#39;s entrepreneurs,making the event influential yet not entirely exclusive</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among the crowd, only a select handful from the city&#39;s inner circle carried the knowledge of her connection to Austin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Colin arrived with Milly at his side.His gaze locked on Brinley the moment he entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had heard she would attend, and that alone   been reason enough to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, he hadn&#39;t planned on bringing Milly, but she had insisted-and he hadn&#39;t managed to refuse her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly had chosen a white dress styled to echo Brinley&#39;s old eleggance, a calculated attempt to imitate her former softness. But against Brinley&#39;s luminous poise,Milly&#39;s effort looked cheap and artificial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Colin, let&#39;s.. let&#39;s head over there,&#34; Milly whispered tightly, clutching her handbag so hard her nails nearly punctured the leather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin&#39;s silence stretched on, his focus pinned entirely to Brinley. She looked more dazzling than ever-like a diamond he had once held in his hand, only to let it slip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley paid no mind to the lingering looks cast her way. She held her champagne glass lightly and stood at the terrace&#39;s edge, serene and untouchable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Shaw, are you all by yourself?&#34; a man&#39;s voice drawled behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned, her gaze falling on a middle-aged man with a sagging belly and an oily grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t recognize him; he clearly wasn&#39;t from any family of consequence. His eyes roved over her with a greasy boldness before he let out a low chuckle. &#34;Nice to meet you. l am Rogelio Scott. Running a company of that scale must be exhausting for someone as young as you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley inclined her head with a courteous nod and shifted just out of reach. &#34;You&#39;re flattering me, Mr.Scott. VantagePath Realty thrives because of the team behind it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What team can measure up to a dependable man?&#34;He pressed, leaning closer until his pudgy fingers nearly brushed her arm. &#34;If you were with me, you wouldn&#39;t have to work so hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping his voice, he added with a hushed murmur,&#34;I can give you more than yoursugar daddy ever could.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hum of conversation dimmed; a few onlookers turned openly curious stares their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression chilled, lips curving into a smile as brittle as glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at his oily face, she couldn&#39;t help recalling the ridiculous gossip that once painted her as some young woman climbing through an old man&#39;s bed. The thought alone made her want to laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ve mistaken me,&#34; she replied aloofly,her words cutting deep.woman of my league is  nowhere near within your reach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rogelio barked out a laugh as if she&#39;d just entertained him. &#34;Ha! Everything has a price, Ms. Shaw. Just say the number.&#34; His hand lifted, thick fingers reaching to pinch her chin. &#34;Stay by my side, and the entire Scott Group could be yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brutal smack shattered the air, silencing the hall in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s palm hovered mid-swing, her fingers tingling from the impact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rogelio clutched his burning cheek, his eyes flashing with shock before twisting into rage. &#34;You dared to slap me?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong with that?&#34; Brinley shook out her stung hand, her gaze slicing through him like steel. &#34;Look at you-pathetic,oily, and shameless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rogelio&#39;s face contorted as he rolled up his sleeves,preparing to lash back-until someone abruptly stepped between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin blocked Rogelio&#39;s path. Though he did not want to cross him, he still stood up for Brinley. &#34;Mr. Scott,laying hands on a woman hardly suits a gentleman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition flickered across Rogelio&#39;s face, then dissolved into a sneer. &#34;Mr. Palmer? I didn&#39;t expect you  to play the hero.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes raked over Colin with contempt. &#34;With Palmer Group&#39;s stock in freefall, you still have the nerve to meddle in other people&#39;s business? Better worry about your own crumbling empire first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the words landed, Colin&#39;s face twisted crimson with fury, his fists balling so tightly that his knuckles whitened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp retort hovered on his tongue, but the memory of Palmer Group&#39;s precarious state silenced him,leaving only frustration in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rogelio, seizing on Colin&#39;s hesitation, lashed his wrath at Brinley. &#34;And you! Don&#39;t fool yourself into thinking a pretty face makes you exceptional. At the end of the day, you&#39;re just a woman! What could you possibly accomplish, you pathetic whore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s glare turned lethal as she demanded,that again, I dare you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the insult could leave his mouth, Brinley&#39;s leg snapped out, striking the back of his knee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rogelio crumpled with a startled cry, collapsing onto the polished floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one swift motion, she seized his tie and yanked him down further, pressing his cheek against the floor with unflinching force</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was low, edged with deadly certainty.&#34;|&#34;L make sure you learn what respect really means.&#34;</p>
