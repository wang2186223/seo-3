                <p>Brinley was still at the project site, double-checking the accuracy of the track markings, completely unaware of the storm brewing across the internet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone, left on top of a toolbox, kept lighting up and dimming, buzzing with notifications she ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Corbin rushed over and urged her to return to the office that she finally saw the flood of messages and the swirl of rumors spreading online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never intended to race under her real name,but somehow the information had leaked, quickly going viral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the company, the senior staff had already gathered in the conference room. They sat around the long table,tension written across their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In front of each person were printed reports with bold,sensational headlines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rising Real Estate Star Dabbles in Racing-Industry Questions Professionalism&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley Moore Using Project for Publicity? Housing  andUrban Development Department LaunchesReview&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley, so it&#39;s true? You really are entering the race?Or is this just a rumor?&#34; Jerome Byrd, one of the most experienced members of the team, finally broke the silence. His face was lined with worry and disapproval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley paused for a moment, then nodded slowly.&#34;Yes. At this point, there&#39;s no sense denying it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerome let out a surprised gasp. &#34;In the real estate industry, reputation and stability are everything! Why would you invite this chaos? If you lose, people will gossip about it and even question your professional credibility!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not doing this for publicity,&#34; Brinley explained,looking up to look at him. &#34;Jerome, you&#39;ve worked with me for years; you know I don&#39;t make reckless decisions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not reckless? Then what is this?&#34; Jerome&#39;s voice rose.&#34;To prove you can race? Is that really worth it? You&#39;ve poured endless nights and all your energy into this project. Why gamble with it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s exactly because we&#39;re at a crucial stage that l have to race,&#34; Brinley retorted. She picked up one of the reports and pointed at a line. &#34;Look at this. They&#39;re saying I don&#39;t even know flag signals or track rules.Letting these lies stand unchallenged would hurt the  project more than anything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Corbin added cautiously, &#34;But if the government freezes the approval process, the financial damage would be huge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Approvals depend on compliance and quality, not on whether I can drive a car,&#34; Brinley said as she rose and walked toward the floor-to-ceiling window. &#34;I&#39;lI make it clear to Elisha that racing is a personal interest,unrelated to the project&#39;s professionalism. But giving up is not an option. Some doubts can only be silenced on the track.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley!&#34; Jerome stood too, slamming a hand on the table. &#34;Your hobby cannot outweigh the future of this company. Don&#39;t you see? Our competitors are waiting for you to slip. You&#39;re giving them ammunition!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice faltered, but then he added, &#34;Racing isn&#39;t something you master overnight. If you perform poorly, the damage to our credibility will be even worse. It would be smarter to clarify things now and minimize the fallout.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conference room went quiet, the only sound Jerome&#39;s heavy breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Corbin opened his mouth as if to speak but fell silent again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The legal advisor pushed up his glasses, breaking the  silence with a cautious voice. &#34;From a legal standpoint, Brinley&#39;s personal involvement in racing won&#39;t impact approval. But from a public relations angle, the risks are real and shouldn&#39;t be dismissed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley turned back, glancing over each face at the table. &#34;I understand your concerns. But trust me,I&#39;ll deliver results you&#39;ll be satisfied with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed her car keys and strode toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving, she added, &#34;Have PR prepare a feature on racer training routines-their schedules, their intensity. Push it to our media partners tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at the worried faces around the table, she softened her tone with a reassuring smile. &#34;Don&#39;t be afraid. Leave this to me. The exhibition race is just around the corner. The harsher the criticism now, the stronger the comeback will be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Brinley walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Corbin watched her retreating figure and sighed.&#34;Honestly... Brinley has a point. Our whole project is built around the spirit of racing. If even the leader won&#39;t face challenges head-on, wouldn&#39;t that make the message hollow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerome dropped back into his chair, chest rising and falling with emotion. His voice was quieter now. &#34;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want her to race. I just don&#39;t want her  to get hurt. And the project could suffer significant negative consequences as a result. She&#39;s the one who has given the most to this, working day and night,pushing herself harder than anyone. I&#39;ve seen it all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The legal advisor leaned forward, adjusting his glasses.&#34;Then let&#39;s support her strategically. I&#39;ll draft a statement stressing that her racing is entirely personal and unrelated to the project. Corbin, line up some positive coverage-highlight the eco-friendly materials we&#39;re using, and show the professionalism of our work. Shift the focus back where it belongs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll handle it right away,&#34; Corbin said with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerome sighed and picked up the blueprints spread on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The design of the track-its smooth curves and sharp angles-bore Brinley&#39;s imprint in every detail. Every line showed her persistence,her passion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he had been too cautious. Maybe Brinley really could prove herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By then, Brinley had already left the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of heading straight to the racetrack,she drove to the Housing and Urban Development Department</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a file folder with her, its contents her strongest arguments against doubt: the latest  environmental assessment reports and updated progress schedules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she walked out of the building, the sky was washed in red by the setting sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisha&#39;s attitude had been less severe than she expected. Perhaps the solid evidence had swayed him.In the end, he simply said, &#34;Be careful with your personal choices. Don&#39;t let them create problems for the project.&#34;</p>
