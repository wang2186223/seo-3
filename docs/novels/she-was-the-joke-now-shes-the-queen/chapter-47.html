                <p>usual. They sat side by side in the living room, the television tuned to a racing broadcast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A replay of a classic race came on, and Brinley&#39;s breath stalled when the camera panned over the stands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The footage was from her final race before retirement, and in the corner of the crowd, a hooded figure bore an unsettling resemblance to Austin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched the cushion tightly, her eyes flicking to him despite herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin was quietly peeling an orange, his face softened by the glow of the screen, seemingly unaware of her unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That racer was incredible,&#34; Brinley remarked, her voice carrying a forced lightness. &#34;Her last race was unforgettable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin held a slice of orange to her lips, answering evenly, &#34;She was good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You watched it?&#34; she asked. &#34;I saw a replay with a client,&#34; he said smoothly,brushing her lips with his fingertips as he offered the fruit.&#34;Is it sweet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulled back into the moment, Brinley felt her cheeks grow hot. She bit into the orange and muttered,&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The broadcast droned on, but her mind drifted elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She studied Austin&#39;s profile, thinking he was like a book written in a code she couldn&#39;t crack, each page holding something hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided to test him. Leaving a racetrack design where he would easily see it, she waited. He glanced once before casually commenting, &#34;That curve&#39;s drawn the wrong way. It&#39;s dangerous and can cause accidents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you know that?&#34; Brinley asked, forcing her voice to stay steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin paused with his glass in hand, answering without hesitation, &#34;From virtual racing simulations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angles like that, when reversed, always cause skids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley frowned slightly. Virtual racing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression was so straightforward that she suddenly felt foolish for doubting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she really was reading too much into it.Perhaps his knowledge came only from old hobbies and simulation games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing not to push further, she turned her focus back to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been notified that the CloudVista Estates project would be suspended for quite some time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had originally been designed as a major undertaking that demanded the combined effort of the entire company. But with such a long delay ahead, waiting it out simply wasn&#39;t practical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided that they should shift their focus and take on other projects. When news broke that the government had announced a tender for a racing-themed real estate project, Brinley was right in the middle of a project kickoff meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the key staff had been called in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the conference room screen, the post-mortem analysis of their last failed commercial complex was still up, while Brinley absentmindedly rolled the stylus between her fingers, her brow tightly drawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley, take a look at this!&#34; Corbin rushed in,holding up his phone. &#34;The government just posted a tender for a racing-themed real estate project. It&#39;s a huge opportunity. Should we go after it?&#34;</p>
