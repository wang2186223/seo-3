                <p>Recently, Colin had been drowning in a mess of problems, each one tied to the whispers that Milly had sabotaged Brinley&#39;s car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For three nights straight, he hadn&#39;t bothered to step foot in the house he shared with Milly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One night,Milly lingered before her vanity, fingertips brushing over her small but growing belly where a four-month-old life stirred within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mirror threw back the image of a woman whose cheeks were pale and a little gaunt, yet beneath her weariness glimmered a faint, secretive satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swung open, and Colin stumbled into the bedroom. He reeked of liquor, his shoulders tight as if barely containing the anger simmering under his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flung his suit jacket across the sofa and tugged at his tie, his jaw tight with restrained fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My grandfather just called again, chewing me out,&#34; he muttered hoarsely,fatigue lacing every word.&#34;Milly,why can&#39;t you keep yourself in line? Why do you always stir up trouble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around, Milly let her features soften into pitiful sorrow, her reddening eyes glistening with tears.&#34;Colin, I promise I didn&#39;t mean to. I just... I&#39;m terrified of losing you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rose from her seat, moving toward him with hesitant steps, her hand trembling as it reached for his arm.Colin,however, shoved her away with a cold flick of disdain, refusing even the brush of her touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His laugh came out low and cutting, his gaze narrowing like a blade at her trembling form.&#34;Don&#39;t act innocent now. Did you think about the consequences when you sabotaged Brinley&#39;s car? Do you even understand how dangerous that was? If she&#39;d really died out there, we wouldn&#39;t just be barred from the Palmer family-you and I would be finished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Brinley&#39;s name left his lips, Milly&#39;s expression faltered, a flicker of jealousy sparking before she quickly buried it beneath a mask of fragile sorrow. Tears slid down her cheeks as she whispered, voice heavy with trembling fear, &#34;I wasn&#39;t thinking straight. You looked at her with so much admiration when she reappeared... It honestly made me feel really insecure. I can&#39;t shake the terror that she&#39;ll take you from me and that our baby will be born a bastard...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand smoothed protectively over her belly, her shoulders curling in on themselves as her voice cracked with desperation. &#34;This is your child, Colin. A son... the very blessing your family has been begging heaven for.How could you even think of abandoning both of us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin&#39;s features eased, the hard edge in his eyes softening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Palmer family&#39;s obsession with a male heir ran deep, and this child stood as his strongest claim to security within the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the shift in him, Milly pressed forward, wrapping her arms tightly around his waist and pressing her damp cheek against his chest. &#34;Colin, I know I crossed the line. Please... just this once, forgive me,&#34; she whispered, her words breaking apart with tears.&#34;|promise you, I&#39;ll never do that again. Please believe me.I only lost control because I love you too much-so much that I can&#39;t think straight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her trembling confession, carried on a breathless voice, scraped at Colin&#39;s defenses. The warmth of her body against his and the haze of alcohol dulled his anger, loosening the tight coil of tension he had been holding inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his gaze to Milly, who was trembling and clinging to him, and finally exhaled a weary sigh. After all, she was carrying his son. His hand lifted stiffly, landing in an awkward pat on her back. &#34;I forgive you,Milly. But promise me... never again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly&#39;s chest fluttered with relief, though she kept her expression carefully sorrowful. &#34;I knew you&#39;d understand. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll take care of myself and the baby. Once he&#39;s here, your family wilI accept me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising on her toes, she brushed a soft kiss against his chin, her eyes glimmering with calculated sweetness.&#34;Please, don&#39;t stay upset with me. I&#39;ve already drawn your bath. Freshen up, and I&#39;ll ease your shoulders with a massage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tear-reddened eyes and submissive tone dulled the sharp edge of his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin reminded himself that a son was vital to cement his place in the Palmer family, and Milly still had her &#34;Fine,&#34; he muttered, turning toward the bathroom as his resistance slipped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly&#39;s lips curved into the faintest trace of a cold smile once Colin&#39;s back disappeared from sight, but she quickly slipped her mask back on, softening her expression as she reached for a fresh towel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the moment, she had wriggled out of disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet deep down, she knew Colin&#39;s affection had already begun to drift beyond her grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she wanted to tighten her hold on him and marry him, she would have to move with far sharper cunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From behind the bathroom door came the steady rush of running water. Milly drifted toward the window,her gaze cutting into the night&#39;s shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley,&#34; she whispered, narrowing her eyes with quiet venom. &#34;Our little game has only just begun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Colin reappeared, steam trailing him from the bath, Milly had slipped into a silk nightgown,her hair gathered loosely at her nape, leaving her slender neck enticingly bare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward with a glass of warm milk, holding it out carefully. &#34;Here, have some. It&#39;ll settle your nerves and help you sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin accepted it without a word, drained it in a single gulp, and set the empty glass down on the bedside table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He climbed into bed and rolled onto his side, turning his back on Milly, his silence making it clear he wanted no more conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, she slipped in beside him, easing closer inch by inch until she could loop an arm gently around his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Colin...&#34; Her voice quivered with a soft dependency as she pressed her cheek against his back. &#34;Whatever happens, you&#39;ll still have me and the baby. We&#39;re your family, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin gave no answer, his breathing evening out. It seemed he had drifted off. Milly, though, remained restless, her eyes tracing the shadows on the ceiling as schemes stirred in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Striking at Brinley again would be reckless for now, but leaving her completely unchallenged wasn&#39;t an option either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin posed an even greater danger-too sharp, too calculating. Crossing him could undo everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hushed sigh escaped her as she pressed her cheek against Colin&#39;s back, drawing faint comfort from his warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She vowed to grip tightly to all she possessed-for her own survival, and for the fragile life turning within her.</p>
