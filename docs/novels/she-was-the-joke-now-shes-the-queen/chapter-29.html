                <p>Twilight slipped away, and night took its place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley cleared the last of the dishes and she began considering where she&#39;d sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll stay in the caregiver&#39;s room next door,&#34; she declared with quiet resolve, scooping up her belongings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel had already arranged it; the suite-like space next door was comfortable enough for her to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Austin&#39;s expression tightened suddenly, his complexion paling as his breath quickened.&#34;My stomach&#39;s acting up,&#34; he admitted, his voice rough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley halted mid-step, turning back to him. &#34;Do you want me to call the doctor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a small shake of his head, brushing it off,though there was a flicker of fragility in his eyes. &#34;No. It&#39;s an old problem. I can manage. Just... if it gets worse in the middle of the night, it&#39;s hard being alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lingered on his bloodless face, and her resolve to leave wavered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin was, after all, a patient. If something did happen...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a call bell in the ward,&#34; she pointed out,her tone steady on the surface yet edged with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin grumbled with a soft edge of grievance,&#34;That bell&#39;s way too loud. I&#39;m not feeling well. All I need is proper rest,nothing else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s words caught in her throat; she had nothing to throw back at his argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze shifted from the folded caregiver&#39;s bed in the corner to his wide, guileless eyes, and finally she let out a weary sigh. &#34;Fine, I&#39;ll sleep on the folding bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She told herself there was no difference-sleep was just sleep, no matter the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resolute, she unfolded the narrow frame with brisk efficiency, smoothing out her own sheets and spreading a blanket across it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s gaze lingered on her small, diligent figure,a flicker of quiet satisfaction flashing through his eyes before he lowered his lids again, pretending weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night settled thick around the ward, broken only by the rhythmic ticking of the monitors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley drifted off quickly, her breathing evening out into the steady rhythm of sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long silence, Austin&#39;s lashes lifted. In the silver wash of moonlight, his gaze lingered on the folding bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley lay curled beneath her blanket, her brow faintly knit as though trapped in a nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley murmured drowsily, her lips brushing against the pillow, &#34;Austin, you jerk... sneaking off with my cookies again...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low laugh rumbled from Austin&#39;s chest as he reached for his phone on the bedside table. With practiced quiet, he switched it to silent, then angled the camera and captured her sleeping face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the screen, a soft crease touched her brows,yet an innocent smile tugged at her lips, leaving her looking almost childlike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight drew him back to that night years ago at the Moore Estate banquet-when she&#39;d been the only one bold enough to stand at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moonlight then had been just as gentle,wrapping her in silver light, lending her an untouchable grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image on his phone dimmed, but the warmth in his eyes lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slipping the device back onto the table, he leaned into the pillow and allowed a tender smile to remain as sleep reclaimed him. By morning, the muffled sound of coughing pulled Brinley from her dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rubbed her eyes and blinked toward the bed.Austin sat half upright, a hand clutched to his chest as a fit of coughs wracked him, his complexion paler than it had been the night before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alarm jolted her fully awake. She scrambled to his side.&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing,&#34; Austin said hoarsely, waving her worry away as his breathing slowly evened. His lips curved subtly as he added, &#34;I just need to go to the bathroom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley took a step back, her finger flicking in the bathroom&#39;s direction. &#34;Go on your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin didn&#39;t budge. His eyes stayed fixed on her.&#34;Help me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow furrowed as she retorted, &#34;You didn&#39;t lose an arm or a leg.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel dizzy,&#34; he countered. He even gave a dramatic sway, as if ready to collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The urge to scream bubbled in her chest,but Brinley bit it back. With no real alternative, she stepped forward and slipped an arm under his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His skin burned with fever, and the frailty in his body pressed most of his weight against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the bathroom door, just as she tried to pull away,his hand shot out and caught hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart lurched, and her face flamed. &#34;Austin!&#34; She yanked her hand back as if scalded. &#34;Handle it yourself. If you can&#39;t, I&#39;ll get a male nurse or doctor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression soured instantly, his frown making his resistance clear.&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34; she immediately demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I don&#39;t like strangers,&#34; he responded, his tone steady. &#34;I hate being touched by anyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley froze, startled by his answer. &#34;Then why do you keep leaning on me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin took in her fiery expression, a delicate trace of amusement in his eyes, though his voice carried nothing but quiet sincerity. &#34;Because you&#39;re different.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart skipped, and the words spiled out before she could stop them. &#34;Different how?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t speak, only held her in that steady gaze,dark and fathomless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unease prickled at her skin. She spun on her heel and stormed toward the door. &#34;Figure it out yourself!Call me only if you&#39;re completely helpless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bathroom door shut hard, a barrier slicing the air between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin leaned back against the cool wall, a low laugh slipping from his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, the door creaked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped out slowly, hand braced against the wall, his complexion ghostly pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley rushed forward, catching his arm, her voice sharp with worry. &#34;I told you to call the nurse! But no -you chose to stay stubborn. And now look at you,suffering and barely able to stand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m fine,&#34; Austin said, his eyes tracing the flush on her face, a quiet strength stirring in him.&#34;With you here, I feel much better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley was struck dumb, but she quickly guided him back to the bed and eased him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay put and quit moving around,&#34; she ordered firmly, pulling the blanket up around him, her voice sharp even as relief softened her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s smile widened as he watched her fuss over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her anxious care was exactly what he craved. That raw, unguarded worry made him happy-it was proof she cared.</p>
