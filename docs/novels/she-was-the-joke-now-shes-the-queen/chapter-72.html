                <p>After the project meeting ended, Brinley massagedher aching temples, exhaustion weighing on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On her drive back to the villa, the car radio buzzegwith updates about the upcoming exhibition race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost reflexively,she cranked up the volume, hergrip tightening onthesteering wheelas theannouncer mentioned the event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tucked behind the passenger-side sun visor was thegold-embossed invitation to the race,its emblem asilent pull on her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each morning before leaving, she would steal a qlanceat it, the sight stirring something deep within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, she arrived home later than usual</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living room was quiet, making her wonder ifAustin was home yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she passed his study, its door slightly ajar, a warmglow spilled into the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nearly walked by, but something on the desk caught her eye, stopping her cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, bathed in lamplight, sat an envelope bearingthe same gold-embossed racing emblem as the onehidden in her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was this possible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath hitched for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Austin received an invitation too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; Austin&#39;s voice called from inside, tingedwith a playful tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard,Brinley felt aflush ofembarrassment at being spotted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She steadied herself with a deep breath and pushedthe door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin lounged behind the desk, casually lifting theenvelope before setting it down with a nonchalantflick. &#34;You&#39;re back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s eyes darted to the envelope, her breathingmeasured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; she said, stepping to the desk and flippingthrough some folders to mask her unease. &#34;What&#39;sthis? lt looks quite fancy.&#34; &#34;lt&#39;s an invitation from FlA,&#34; Austin said, leaning backwith his arms crossed, his gaze fixed on her. &#34;Theywant me to join the exhibition race.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exhibition race?&#34; Brinley&#39;s voice tightened &#34;Are yougoing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t decided yet.&#34; Austin gave the envelope asmall shake. &#34;What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You shouldn&#39;t go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words slipped out before she could stop themand she instantly regretted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her response was too quick, too telling, as if she weredesperate to keep him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough,Austin&#39;sbrowarched,hiseyessharpening with curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley scrambled to recover, forcing a neutral tone&#34;You&#39;re Austin Moore, a man worth billions. Whybother with a showy race? lt&#39;s dangerous. What ifthere&#39;s an accident?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;An accident?&#34; Austin cut in, standing abruptly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His height loomed as he stepped closer, his gazecarrying a subtle weight. &#34;You think l will lose?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not about that,&#34; Brinley said, her back pressing against the desk&#39;s cold edge, trapped. &#34;it&#39;s not worthit. The prize money&#39;s a drop in the bucket comparedto your projects. A loss would be humiliating, and aninjury? That would derail everything at Moore Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, Austin gently tilted her chin up</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in, his face so close his breath grazed herforehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem awfully worried about me racing. Why isthat?&#34; His low voice sent a shiver through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You&#39;re imagining things.&#34; Brinley forced a calmfacade. &#34;|&#39;m just being realistic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;ls that so?&#34; Austin chuckled, letting go of her chin.Then why do you look so on edge?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, she stepped back, forgetting the deskbehind her. Her lower back hit the edge, and shewinced in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be careful,&#34; Austin said, his hand swiftly finding herwaist, the warmth of his palm seeping through hershirt, igniting a spark across her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were closer now, his chest nearly brushing hershoulder, his breath warm against her neck</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s heartbeat thundered, loud enough to betrayher &#34;What are you so nervous about?&#34; Austin asked softly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;1..&#34; Brinley faltered, grasping for an excuse butfinding none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her foot caught on his shoe, and shestumbled forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s arm instinctively wrapped around her, andthey tumbled to the floor with a muffled thud, landingin a heap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley found herself in his arms, her cheek pressedagainst his shirt, his familiar scent enveloping her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip tightened briefly around her waist, as ifreluctant to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to push herself up, but his hand gentlypressed her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Hold still.&#34; he said, his voice husky, tinged with theshock of their fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breathing was uneven, mirroring her own. She wasforced to stay in his lap, and the intimacy of theirposition sent heat rushing to her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley,&#34; Austin murmured, his fingers brushing gentlythrough her hair, his touch soft. &#34;Are you hidingsomething from me?&#34; His eyes,deep and searching,seemed to piercethrough her defenses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, she nearly blurted out, &#34;l got theinvitation too.l was a pro racer, and l want toparticipate in the exhibition race!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she clamped down on the words, unwilling toreveal that truth. Not yet, at least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Stop being silly. What would l even be keeping fromyou?&#34; Brinley dodged his eyes, giving his shoulder alight push. &#34;Let go of me. This is weird.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin didn&#39;t probe further</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He loosened his grip on her waist and steadied her asshe stood. &#34;Fine, we&#39;ll leave it at that.</p>
