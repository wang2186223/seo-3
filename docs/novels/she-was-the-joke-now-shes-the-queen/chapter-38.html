                <p>Brinley&#39;s lips parted as if she might swallow the words back, but she forced them out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Austin.&#34; Her voice trembled, then steadied. &#34;Do you...do this often?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his head, his gaze fixed on her in the dim light.&#34;Do what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Manipulate people.&#34; The hesitation faded,replaced with quiet insistence. &#34;Even me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin didn&#39;t answer right away. A long silence stretched between them, heavy with things unspoken. At last, he said evenly, &#34;In the Moore family, if I don&#39;t stay three steps ahead, I&#39;Il end up falling into someone else&#39;s trap. I won&#39;t let that happen. And I won&#39;t let you get hurt either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no mockery in his tone, no shield of arrogance-o nly a raw honesty that caught her off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though shadows hid the details of his face, Brinley could still catch the honesty shining through his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see,&#34; she murmured, her voice barely audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curling onto her side with her back to Austin,she tried to still her racing thoughts. Onlya few minutes passed before the steady rhythm of his breathing filled the quiet room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to resist, she shifted just enough to steal a glance at him. A thin blade of moonlight slipping through the curtains sketched his face in sharp relief,highlighting the strong cut of his profile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked as though sleep had already claimed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her taut nerves loosened, yet rest still wouldn&#39;t come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dip in the mattress reminded her that he was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His scent drifted across the narrow space-crisp cedar-not heavy, but insidious, curling around her senses like smoke. The more she breathed it in, the wider awake she became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low murmur drifted from behind her. &#34;Still awake?&#34;The words carried an easy tone, but a quiet thread of curiosity wound through them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s pulse faltered, and she instinctively stilled,her breath shallow. Her lashes fluttered despite her effort to remain composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced her chest to rise and fall in an even rhythm, fingers curling tightly into the sheet beneath her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin didn&#39;t speak again, leaving the room to its hush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she couldn&#39;t shake the heat of his unseen gaze pressing against her back-steady, inquisitive,almost burning-raising goosebumps along her nape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dared not roll over, eyes clamped shut as if sleep had already claimed her, though her thougts wandered restlessly in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clock on the nightstand marked each dragging second until its hands pointed to one in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s eyelids drooped heavier by the second, and just as she began sinking into real sleep, the mattress shifted under a subtle weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath caught, every musce strung tight as she sensed his presence leaning closer, the warmth of his gaze pressing down over her like a shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For one dizzying heartbeat, she thought his fingers would graze her hair-but the touch never came, the moment suspended in a fragile hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley.&#34; Austin&#39;s voice borushed against her ear,hushed and fleeting, like a sigh swallowed by the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lashes trembled, a strange sensation unfurling in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She burrowed deeper into the mattress, giving a soft, &lt;</p>
