                <p>The moment Brinley appeared in a fitted white suit,Colin clenched his fists tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood tall, looking composed and confident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked nothing like the soft, naive woman he had once known.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next, VantagePath Realty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her company&#39;s name was called, Brinley strode to the podium and began her presentation without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The 3D model projected on the screen turned slowly,clearly displaying the intricacies of her design and integration plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our innovative spatial planning can increase land use efficiency by 30 percent,&#34; Brinley concluded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she finished, the room burst into applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her delivery was polished and professional, every data point seamlessly connected to the government&#39;s requirements, each design stage presented with flawless clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin was no longer smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found it difficult to reconcile this poised strategist with the Brinley he remembered. Even more startling was her command of urban planning. She even responded to technical questions with ease, in areas his seasoned team of experts usually had to debate over at length.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next, the Palmer Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin forced down his unease and mounted the stage,beginning his presentation. But by the third slide, the development district director chimed in, &#34;Mr. Palmer,VantagePath Realty&#39;s proposal is clearly superior to yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin blanched, a thin sheen of sweat forming at his temples. He opened his mouth to protest but quickly realized there was no point. Compared to Brinley&#39;s,his proposal fell short, especially in interpreting and applying policy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The committee has reached a unanimous decision,&#34;the director announced. &#34;VantagePath Realty&#39;s proposal best aligns with Bleron&#39;s development plans The contract will be awarded to VantagePath Realty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thunderous applause filled the room. Colin shot to his  feet,his chair screeching loudly against the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at Brinley, who stood on stage with a calm,composed smile as she shook hands with the director.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her smile and carry herself with such grace struck Colin like a physical blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meeting ended, he intercepted her in the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; he rasped. &#34;You knew how important this project was to me! Was this all just revenge? Fine,take the project! I don&#39;t care about anything else; just come back to me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley regarded him with a cold, almost amused expression, as though he were a stranger. &#34;Mr.Palmer,VantagePath Realty won fairly. This project was never yours to grant; it was mine to earn. What you should be asking is why the Palmer Group failed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned on her heel, leaving him behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The click of her heels against the hallway floor struck Colin like a heavy blow, leaving him breathless and aching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, Brinley returned to Hillcrest Villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The satisfaction of winning the bid had washed away her tiredness. &#34;You are back.&#34; Austin&#39;s voice floated from the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat on the sofa, a stack of documents in hand. In recent days, they had both been so busy that they had rarely seen each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley acknowledged him with a nod as she bent to change her shoes, her eyes unintentionally catching on the glimpse of his collar left slightly open. &#34;You&#39;re home early today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting aside the documents, Austin rose and came toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, he wore a grey casual outfit that softened his appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations,&#34; he said, a faint smile on his lips.&#34;Securing this project means VantagePath Realty has a promising future ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley smiled, &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin stared at her for a moment before changing the subject. &#34;We talked about visiting your father.When would he be available?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reminder made Brinley tense slightly; the matter had completely slipped her mind. &#34;My dad&#39;s been very busy lately... Maybe in a few more days,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin seemed to see through the excuse, but he didn&#39;t push. &#34;No hurry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, as darkness settled over the villa,Brinley remembered Austin&#39;s earlier words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She curled herself into the beanbag chair in the attic,her phone in hand, her finger hesitating above the contact labeled &#34;Dad&#34; before finally pressing the dial button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After two rings, a familiar, jovial voice answered the phone. &#34;Well, if it isn&#39;t the CEO of VantagePath Realty!The workaholic finally has time to call her father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged at Brinley&#39;s lips. &#34;Dad, I&#39;ve just secured a project for my company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good to hear,&#34; Brandon Shaw replied. Then his voice turned stern. &#34;Now tell me,how&#39;s Austin treating you? Is he bad to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Austin, Brinley felt a tug in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Actually, he&#39;s suggested visiting you. He&#39;s even  talking about arranging a wedding ceremony.&#34; She sounded casual as she added, &#34;I just wanted to know when you might be free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a silence on the line for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley could almost picture her father rubbing his chin in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d love for you to come visit,&#34; Brandon replied, his voice softening, carrying a hint of warmth. &#34;But I still haven&#39;t forgiven you for what happened with Colin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley felt a sudden ache in her chest.She knew her father&#39;s words were harsh, but beneath them lay nothing but love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, I was foolish back then...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, enough,&#34; Brandon said, interrupting her gently. &#34;No need to drag up the past. How about next Saturday? I&#39;ll be available then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated before adding, &#34;Just so you know,your brothers are tied up with their own work and can&#39;t attend. Hope you don&#39;t mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley let out a small laugh. &#34;Dad, I don&#39;t mind.They&#39;ve got their own responsibilities. It&#39;s only a meal;it doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re there or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was well aware that her brothers were constantly busy, always away with their own commitments, and over time, the family had simply grown used to their absence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good,&#34; Brandon said warmly. &#34;And tell Austin he better not come empty-handed. I&#39;ll be expecting a gift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll remind him,&#34; Brinley said, chuckling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, she felt relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter his scolding, her father&#39;s love was constant and unconditional.</p>
