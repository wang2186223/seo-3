                <p>Austin blinked, clearly caught off guard by Brinley&#39;s question. After a beat, a wider grin spread across his face. &#34;I&#39;m more invested in the woman sitting here with me than in any racer hidden behind a helmet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lingered on her with disarming sincerity.&#34;You get to eat my cooking. The one in the helmet doesn&#39;t get this privilege.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat crept into Brinley&#39;s cheeks, and she let out a sharp little scoff. &#34;You really are a shameless sweet-talker.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m only stating facts,&#34; Austin countered lightly, his tone threaded with amusement. &#34;Tomorrow I&#39;ll have Miguel drop off a set of racing documentaries-deep dives into classic events. Since you&#39;re working on that interview segment, they could prove useful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suggestion came off casual, yet deliberate, a seamless blend of generosity and another gentle nudge toward racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley recognized it instantly as one of his subtle probes, but no excuse came to mind strong enough to turn him down. &#34;Thanks,&#34; she murmured, spearinga bite of food. Then her voice softened. &#34;But watching documentaries only gives theories. Maybe... when you have a chance,you could explain it to me in person? You clearly know cars, and nothing beats firsthand knowledge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she tilted her head, offering him a faint, sly smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If there was no escaping his game, she might as well take the lead and see where it carried them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin caught the spark of defiance dancing in her eyes and let out a low chuckle. &#34;I&#39;d be glad to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slid another rib onto her plate with casual ease.&#34;Go on, eat before they cool off-doesn&#39;t taste the same once they lose the heat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dinner carried a quiet undercurrent, a balance between comfort and tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their talk drifted from updates on work projects to the occasional detour into racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the conversation stretched on, Brinley became aware that Austin&#39;s manner wasn&#39;t intrusive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t prying or stripping away her defenses.Instead,it felt like a subtle game played in silence, one where both knew the rules without spelling them out. Every so often, he lobbed a question her way,gauging her reaction with sharp eyes, then effortlessly pivoted to a different subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange tingle ran through her chest. Logic told her to be wary, but instead of resistance, a quiet spark of anticipation stirred in her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley gave her head a sharp shake, dismissing the absurd thought, and lowered her gaze to the rib waiting on her plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sweet-and-sour glaze coated her tongue,its layered flavors echoing her own mood-tangled,bittersweet, impossible to name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across town, Milly reclined on a cushioned spa bed, a cool mudpack spread evenly over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The beautician&#39;s hands kneaded her shoulders with practiced ease, working slow, steady circles along her tense neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the treatment should have been indulgent,a crease remained etched between Milly&#39;s brows, her troubled thoughts refusing to loosen their grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone buzzed with a curt text from Colin. &#34;Dinner party tonight. Won&#39;t be back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly&#39;s chest tightened as she stared at the screen,  emotions tangling inside her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Brinley launched her flashy racing-themed real estate project, Colin&#39;s visits home had dwindled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the rare nights he did appear, he sat glued to his laptop, the glow of the monitor often revealing Brinley&#39;s company page.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unease clung to Milly like a shadow. Brinley&#39;s name lingered everywhere-on Colin&#39;s lips, in his work, in his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley wasn&#39;t just climbing higher in her career;she seemed determined to reclaim the very place Milly held most dear-Colin&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly couldn&#39;t accept it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the next bed, a woman reclined with her phone pressed to her ear, her voice lilting with syrupy sweetness as she gossiped about love and romance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All at once, the conversation shifted. &#34;What did you just say? Rosara&#39;s staging a comeback? Seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly blinked her eyes. Her ears caught every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosara?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name struck a chord-wasn&#39;t that the female racer who had once dominated headlines, only to  vanish without a trace?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She will attend the upcoming exhibition race? Really?&#34;the woman asked, her voice rising with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation dissolved into noise,and Milly barely paid attention until a particular name cut through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley? You mean the one leading that racing-themed project? She&#39;s entering the race herself?&#34; the woman asked in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words jolted Milly so hard her pulse skipped,nearly propelling her upright off the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly reeled at the thought-Brinley entering a car race?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revelation tore through her haze like a flash of lightning</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For weeks she had been clawing for a weakness, yet every angle crumbled against Brinley&#39;s spotless project and Austin&#39;s steadfast support. Any frontal attack would have been a suicide mission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this changed everything. A real estate developer participating in an exhibition race was bound to spark whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the right push, the spectacle could be twisted into a circus act-a shameless ploy for attention dressed up as ambition. Milly&#39;s thoughts spun in circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley was determined to secure her place as a rising star in real estate while simultaneously dazzling the racing world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet that daring two-front campaign was as dangerous as wielding a blade with no handle-one wrong move,and it could slice straight through her. The spectacle could collapse into disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take this mask off, now,&#34; Milly ordered abruptly,her voice sharp with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The beautician froze, startled. &#34;But the treatment isn&#39;t finished yet...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take it off. Now!&#34; Milly insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The beautician peeled away the mudpack, and Milly wasted no time. She swept on a layer of makeup with brisk strokes, snapped her compact shut, and slung her bag over her shoulder before striding out of the beauty salon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding into the back seat of her car, she immediately punched in a number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end was an entertainment reporter Colin had once introduced her to-a man who thrived on scandals and click-bait headlines &#34;I&#39;ve got something worth your while,&#34; Milly murmured,lowering her voice with a deliberate air of secrecy.&#34;A crossover bombshell-real estate colliding with racing.The kind of story that&#39;ll set the internet on fire.&#34;</p>
