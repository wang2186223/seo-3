                <p>From the rearview mirror, Brinley caught sight of Austin standing with his hands slipped casually into the pockets of his racing suit as he stared firmly at her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sunlight wrapped him in a golden glow, but a shiver still ran down Brinley&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The uncanny insight in his words made her shiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His deep understanding of cornering techniques and his spot-on evaluations of modifications... Aflicker of suspicion began to glow within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The red race car tore down the track, but Brinley&#39;s focus faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, Austin&#39;s image blurred and overlapped with her memory of the enigmatic racer known as Nightblade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nightblade had been just as mysterious as she was-never appearing off the track, existing only as a shadow within the racing world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that... Brinley quickly shoved the thought away. No. It was absurd. Austin was the head of the Moore Group, a man consumed by business. How could he possibly be involved in professional racing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing her thoughts back into order,she steadied her breathing and deliberately chose the safest line through the final corner, braking cleanly like a novice determined not to take risks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she rolled back into the pit, Austin was still there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pit crew member was changing the tires on his sleek black race car, while he sat perched on a toolbox, scrolling through track data. Looking up as she approached, he asked calmly, &#34;Done practicing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pretty much. Time to call it a day,&#34; Brinley answered quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin rose and walked over. &#34;Next time, if there&#39;s a chance,we should do a couple of laps together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked briefly to her rose-patterned helmet.&#34;I&#39;m very interested in you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s heart almost stopped beating. She muttered a curt reply, snatched up her backpack, and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the doorway, she risked one last glance back.  Austin was still watching her, his eyes as deep as an abyss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding into her car, Brinley tugged off the voice changer and exhaled hard. Cold sweat plastered her racing suit to her skin, making her shiver uncomfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started the engine. Behind her, Austin&#39;s black race car fired up with a roar, shooting down the track,its thunderous growl echoing into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley drummed her fingers lightly on the steering wheel, her mind in knots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Austin truly be Nightblade?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was their meeting at the track today pure coincidence,or had he come looking for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The questions crowded her thoughts, leaving her unsettled about the upcoming exhibition race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brinley arrived home that evening, she found a small bouquet of fresh sunflowers placed neatly at the center of the long dining table, their cheerful brightness filling the room with warmth. The aroma of rich, savory dishes drifted through the air, awakening her appetite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After slipping into comfortable home clothes,she saw Austin step out of the kitchen, carrying a steaming  dish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Smells incredible,&#34; she said with a smile, her tone lighter</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though their unexpected encounter at the racetrack still lingered in her chest, seeing him in this familiar,domestic space eased some of her unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin set the dish on the table and took a seat across from her. &#34;Fresh from the stove. Best eaten while it&#39;s hot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He served her a rib, adding, &#34;I know you like sweet, so I added extra sugar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking down at the glossy rib in her plate, Brinley felt a warm feeling spread inside her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin usually preferred lighter flavors, rarely making sweet dishes. This one was clearly for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; Brinley muttered, lowering her head as she took a gentle bite</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meal went on in silence, the soft clinking of cutlery the only sound between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley carefully steered away from racing talk,instead recounting amusing incidents from the construction site. When she mentioned the supervisor blowing up again over the workers slacking, Austin chuckled under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is the asphalt work moving smoothly?&#34; he asked suddenly,ladling soup into her bowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. The hardness tests passed; we can mark the track lines next week.&#34; She took a sip of the soup before adding, &#34;When will the imported guardrail samples arrive? I&#39;d like to run some checks myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They should land tomorrow. I&#39;ll let you know once they&#39;re in.&#34; Austin nodded, staring at the small curve of her lips before shifting gears. &#34;I stopped by a private racetrack this afternoon. Met a racer worth noting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley froze for an instant, masking her surprise with feigned interest. &#34;Oh? What kind of racer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wore a rose-patterned helmet,&#34; Austin said casually,sipping his soup, his eyes watching her closely. &#34;Drove a red car. The modifications were clever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley tried hard to keep her expression neutral.&#34;A rose-patterned helmet? That&#39;s unusual. Were they better than you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hard to judge,&#34; Austin replied, setting his spoon down.&#34;Straight-line speed was average, but the cornering  was bold,almost reckless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds professional enough,&#34; Brinley said, forcing herself not to flinch. &#34;But I don&#39;t know much about racing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Austin chuckled softly, a glint of amusement flickering in his eyes. He didn&#39;t press further. Instead, he added another serving to her plate.&#34;This one&#39;s tender. You&#39;ll like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley stared at the food before her, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin was like a hunter. He had his prey in sight, but instead of striking, he circled patiently, tightening the trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The subtle pressure of his probing was far more unnerving than an open confrontation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed her cutlery down, leaned forward slightly.and with a sudden laugh, said teasingly, &#34;You seem to remember that racer&#39;s car awfully well. Tell me, Austin,are you interested in the one wearing the rose-patterned helmet?&#34;</p>
