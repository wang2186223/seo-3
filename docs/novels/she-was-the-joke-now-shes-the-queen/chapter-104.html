                <p>Colin averted his gaze, struck by this unfamiliar side of Brinley-bold and razor-sharp, a spark he had never witnessed when they were together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Colin, isn&#39;t Mrs. Moore incredible?&#34; Milly purred, pressing close to him with a syrupy voice. &#34;But racing is so risky. Wouldn&#39;t it be nicer to live quietly at homne? Well, all I know is how to look after you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lingered on &#34;look after you,&#34; subtly suggesting she was his true match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin only gave a nod, his eyes locked on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly&#39;s nails bit into her palm. Her meticulously laid plans had unraveled-her smear campaign against Brinley backfired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it! Now Colin couldn&#39;t stop thinking about Brinley!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy seared through Milly, threatening to unravel her composure. She stood abruptly, muttering,&#34;1&#34;m heading to the restroom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin didn&#39;t acknowledge her, and Milly stormed off, lips pressed tight, her silhouette radiating contained rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing Brinley would likely visit the lounge post-race, Milly loitered in the corridor, checking her reflection on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face projected delicate innocence, but her mind churned with plans to deliver biting words in the softest tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the corridor&#39;s dim glow, Brinley stepped out of the lounge, only to find Milly blocking her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations, Mrs. Moore,&#34;Milly said with a sweet smile. &#34;I couldn&#39;t bear to watch your thrilling race earlier. It&#39;s so dangerous for a woman to do such things-what if you got hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mocking words barely landed when a group of young fans in school uniforms rounded the corner, shouting,&#34;Brinley!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A boy, caught up in the excitement, accidentally knocked into Milly as he rushed forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly stumbled and twisted her ankle, collapsing with a hand on her stomach, her face paling dramatically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone has fallen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s pregnant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd exploded into chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly shivered in pain but fixed a calculating glance on Brinley, quickly overtaken by feigned agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting her lip, she whispered, &#34;It&#39;s fine... it&#39;s not Mrs. Moore&#39;s fault... just an accident...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words slyly implicated Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley frowned at Milly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four months pregnant was a delicate stage, but the fall seemed too convenient, almost staged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no time to dwell, she dialed emergency services, stating clearly, , &#34;City racetrack. A four-mont pregnant woman has abdominal pain after a collision. She needs urgent help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Onlookers buzzed with murmurs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One is Colin&#39;s ex, the other is his current girlfriend...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A fight over him, maybe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly caught the murmurs, a faint smirk forming as she played up her distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ambulance screeched in just as Colin arrived, fresh from watching the award ceremony, his chest tigh with frustration. He had wanted to talk to Brinley, but was met with this mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Milly on the ground with a trace of blood beneath her, his pulse raced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Milly!&#34; He knelt beside her, his voice shaking. Milly&#39;s eyes welled up as she grabbed his hand weakly, shaking her head. &#34;Don&#39;t blame Mrs. Moore... it wasn&#39;t her fault...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin&#39;s gaze snapped to Brinley, brimming with accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley met his stare, unflinching. &#34;The ambulance is almost here. Get her to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stung by her indifference, Colin nearly snapped back, but medics arrived with a stretcher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Milly was lifted, she murmured to him, &#34;Colin... don&#39;t be upset...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the ambulance speed off, Colin&#39;s fists clenched as he turned to Brinley, voice sharp. &#34;How could you be so heartless? I can&#39;t believe you&#39;d hurt a pregnant woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s brow lifted, her tone edged with disdain. &#34;Use your head, Colin. Ask the witnesses what actually happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speechless, Colin watched her walk away, a piece of him feeling torn apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the hospital&#39;s VIP ward, Milly lay pale on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor had just left, assuring that the baby was safe but emphasizing Milly&#39;s need for rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin sat beside her, observing her delicate condition, haunted by the doctor&#39;s warning. &#34;Ten more minutes,and we might have lost him.&#34; The memory of the family&#39;s elation upon learning it was a boy intensified the guilt surging through him like a flood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Colin...&#34; Milly&#39;s eyes fluttered open, her voice barely a whisper. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry... for causing you worry...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t say anything, just focus on resting,&#34; Colin cut in, his voice gentler now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Milly clung to his hand, tears streaming like shattered pearls. &#34;Don&#39;t hold it against Mrs. Moore.It&#39;s not her doing... I&#39;m to blame... not careful enough...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice grew more plaintive, tears flowing unchecked. &#34;I know you still have feelings for her... but I need you, and our baby needs you too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gentle words pierced deeply, tightening Colin&#39;s chest with guilt. Gazing at her rounded belly and tear-streaked face, he let out a heavy sigh. &#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere.I&#39;ll stay right here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint of cunning triumph flashed in Milly&#39;s eyes, swiftly veiled by her practiced frailty as she nodded meekly, resting against his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, she had won. Colin chose to stay with her.</p>
