                <p>Brinley went straight to the kitchen the moment she returned to the villa, determined to check on how the staff were doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chef was busy at the stove while the servants moved briskly around him, each step efficient and orderly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chaos she had once stirred up here had vanished without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t worry, Mrs. Moore,&#34; the chef assured her, turning with a respectful nod. &#34;Every dish l prepare for Mr. Moore will be soft, balanced, and easy to digest, just as the doctor recommended.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That promise eased her heart, and she gave a satisfied nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she made to head out, she nearly collided with Austin, who was leaning casually in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch your step next time,&#34; he murmured,steadying her with one hand. His fingers brushed her arm-warm and soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I know.&#34; Brinley pulled back immediately, a faint frown tugging at her lips. &#34;Why are you here?Shouldn&#39;t you be resting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin gave a quiet, unhurried reply. &#34;I was waiting for you.&#34; He eased into a smile, though his complexion remained pale. &#34;The doctor said light walks will help me recover. How about joining me for a stroll in the garden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the exhaustion written across his face, Brinley couldn&#39;t bring herself to refuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They moved slowly along the garden path, shoulder to shoulder, while sunlight streamed through the branches above, scattering mottled shadows across the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air carried the freshness of grass and blooming  flowers, yet it was faintly tinged with the sterile scent of antiseptic that clung to Austin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Austin,&#34; Brinley murmured, nudging a loose pebble with her shoe. &#34;Don&#39;t you think there are people waiting to exploit your sickness and cause trouble at Moore Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of him saying that more than half the Moore family wanted to see him collapse made her nerves tighten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t let it weigh on you,&#34; Austin answered evenly,his tone calm as stone. &#34;Miguel will take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley gave a small nod and let the matter drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew there was little she could do, so all she could offer was a quiet prayer for his swift recovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several days later, on a warm afternoon, she sat in the living room, poring over a stack of real estate project files when Miguel appeared. His tone was formal as he reported, &#34;Mr. Moore, Mrs. Moore,someone from the Moore family has arrived,inviting  you both to return to the Moore Estate for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley lifted her gaze from the papers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Moore family had finally reached out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin set aside the document in his hand and said evenly, &#34;Tell them we will visit over the weekend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; Miguel bowed slightly before leaving the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were alone, Brinley turned toward Austin,concern edging her voice. &#34;You&#39;re really planning to go back? But you&#39;re still recovering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s reply was calm, steady. &#34;I&#39;ll be fine. It&#39;s time you met my father and the rest of the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley hesitated, her brows knitting before she finally murmured, &#34;Can I skip it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of being paraded before the Moore family, their sharp gazes dissecting her every move,made her stomach tighten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s reply left no room for debate. &#34;Absolutely  not. Being my wife ties you to the Moore family. Like it or not, we&#39;ll have to return. The sooner you adapt,the easier it&#39;ll be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she recognized the truth in his words,resistance stilI tugged at her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, she gave a reluctant nod and conceded,&#34;Fine...I&#39;ll go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the decision was made, she threw herself into preparations with quiet determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never set foot in the Moore household before and had no idea about their tastes or temperaments. Showing up empty-handed would be unthinkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the next few days, Brinley threw herself into her own little campaign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked Miguel to discreetly collect information on each family member&#39;s preferences, then set out on a carefully planned shopping spree, determined to arrive at the Moore Estate with thoughtful gifts in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On her first day out, Brinley headed straight to the city&#39;s most exclusive luxury mall. Knowing Austin&#39;s sister had a weakness for handbags, she carefully selected a limited-edition piece that wasn&#39;t easy to come by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following afternoon, she attended a high-profile auction. Since Austin&#39;s father was an avid art collector, she bid aggressively until she secured a notable oil painting by a celebrated master-an indulgence that cost her dearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the third day, she wandered through a tucked-away antique shop, searching for something wvith history. Austin&#39;s eldest brother had a fondness for timepieces, so she chose a weathered but impeccably preserved pocket watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t forget the others either, arranging thoughtful gifts for each member of the Moore family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every day, she set out early and returned long after  dusk, her body weary from the endless errands. The moment she stepped through the door, she collapsed onto the sofa, too tired to move another step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin, watching her rush in and out in haste every day, grew increasingly puzzled about what she had been secretly planning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He called Miguel with a laid-back ease. &#34;Miguel,what&#39;s Brinley been up to lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel faltered for a moment before giving a candid reply. &#34;She&#39;s been running all over-luxury malls,auctions, antique shops. From the looks of it, she&#39;s hunting for gifts for your family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin blinked in surprise, not expecting her to go to such lengths. &#34;She went by herself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right,&#34; Miguel immediately confirmed.&#34;She wouldn&#39;t let me trail her. Said she wanted to choose everything personally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin ended the call. A subtle, tender smile tugged  at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By evening, Brinley trudged home, worn out from the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she stepped inside, she spotted Austin on the sofa. He held a document in hand, though his eyes weren&#39;t on the page-they were fixed on her,watching quietly as she walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin rose to his feet and relieved her of the shopping bags. &#34;You&#39;re home. Looks like you went a little overboard shopping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pretty much,&#34; Brinley muttered with a weary nod.She kicked off her shoes, collapsed onto the sofa,and rubbed her sore legs. &#34;I&#39;m completely wiped out,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of her slumped shoulders tugged at him, a pang of guilt cutting through his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling beside her, he lifted one of the gift boxes and flipped it open. &#34;This one&#39;s for my dad,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed.&#34; Her head slumped against the cushion. &#34;Miguel mentioned he&#39;s into paintings, so l found one that might suit his taste. I can only hope he appreciates it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;ll love it,&#34; Austin said without hesitation, his tone warm.&#34;You handpicked it-he&#39;d be a fool not to.&#34;</p>
