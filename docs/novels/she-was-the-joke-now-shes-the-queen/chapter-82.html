                <p>Brinley eased into the driver&#39;s seat, clicking her seatbelt into place as her phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name &#34;Austin&#34; lit up the screen, and after a brief pause, she swiped to pick up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you?&#34; Austin&#39;s rich, steady voice came through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just left the Housing and Urban Development Department,&#34; Brinley replied, turning the key in the ignition. &#34;Did you see those rumors floating around online?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint shuffle of papers sounded from Austin&#39;s end.&#34;Yeah. Do you want me to handle it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s fingers tightened around the wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Austin could squash the gossip effortlessly,but that wasn&#39;t her style.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,I&#39;ve got this,&#34; she said quietly. &#34;I signed up for the exhibition race-so this mess is on me to clean up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief silence followed, then a soft chuckle. &#34;How do  you plan to handle it? Learning more about racing from the book &#39;Racetrack Engineering Analysis&#39; that you borrowed from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s cheeks flushed, a touch of embarrassment hitting her. &#34;Stop teasing me. I&#39;m thinking of having PR drop some training shots and tie them to old interview pieces to shift the narrative.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fair enough, I&#39;ll stop,&#34; Austin said, his tone growing serious. &#34;Where are you practicing? Do you need someone to look out for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need to bother,&#34; Brinley replied quickly.&#34;I&#39;ve got some old friends helping me out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She definitely didn&#39;t want to run into Austin at the track, especially not while she was there only as Brinley, without her professional facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s voice stayed even. &#34;Stay safe then, and come home early tonight. I had the chef whip up some soup for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; Brinley said, ending the call swiftly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sank back in her seat, staring out at the fading twilight and letting out a slow breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s easygoing demeanor always masked his knack for hitting her weak spots. Instead of heading home, she steered toward a racetrack on the city&#39;s edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Less isolated than her previous spot, it was perfect for someone &#34;new&#34; to practice in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already told Jensen to stash the red racecar and bring out a plain white one instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she pulled in, Jensen was waiting by the entrance with a young guy in work gear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley, meet my cousin, Fenton Miller. He used to be a racing team technician, and he will help you train,&#34;Jensen said, nodding toward the young man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fenton, looking barely out of his teens and a bit shy,gave a quick nod. &#34;Nice to meet you,Brinley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for helping out,&#34; Brinley said with a warm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jensen clapped Fenton&#39;s shoulder. &#34;Make sure she gets the hang of the car, and keep things smooth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, leaning closer to Brinley, he lowered his voice.&#34;Rosara, I saw the stuff online. If you need backup,just say so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart warmed, and she nodded. &#34;I&#39;m good, don&#39;t worry.&#34; Sliding into the white car&#39;s driver&#39;s seat, Brinley took a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This car was far less powerful than the red one, but that was the point-it screamed &#34;beginner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fenton settled into the passenger seat, calmly guiding Brinley through the car&#39;s controls and features. &#34;The brakes are a bit loose, so you&#39;ll want to ease into them before corners,&#34; he advised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley nodded, absorbing his words with focus,intentionally keeping her driving cautious to mimic a beginner&#39;s skill, even pausing slightly at turns</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fenton remained patient, offering soft corrections whenever she slipped up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few laps, she started to settle in, gradually picking up speed and handling corners with smoother precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While nowhere near the expertise of Rosara, her performance was believable enough to avoid looking like a total rookie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re getting the hang of it quick, Brinley,&#34; Fenton said with genuine admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flashed a smile, about to reply, wvhen a familiar black Maybach caught her eye at the track&#39;s entrance. Her pulse raced, fingers tightening on the wheel</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was Austin here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Maybach&#39;s door swung open,and Austin stepped out,his sharp black suit clashing with the track&#39;s grimy,oil-soaked vibe yet somehow commanding every gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He strode directly toward them, and Fenton quickly hopped out to greet him. &#34;Mr. Moore,&#34; he said respectfully</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin gave a brief nod, his eyes locking onto Brinley through the window with a subtle smirk. &#34;It seems like you&#39;re coming along nicely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley stepped out of the car, brushing dust off her clothes with practiced nonchalance. &#34;Hardly. I was just fumblingthroughsomepractice.Whatbringsyouhere?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was nearby and figured I would swing by,&#34; Austin said, his gaze flicking to the white car. &#34;This car doesn&#39;t really match you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m a beginner. A high-end car would be overkill,&#34;Brinley replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a soft laugh, not pressing the point, and turned to Fenton. &#34;How is she doing?&#34; &#34;Brinley has got real skill and picks things up fast,&#34;Fenton replied honestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin nodded, his eyes drifting back to Brinley.&#34;Want to take my car for a spin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, glancing at the Maybach, and quickly waved it off. &#34;No way, I&#39;m not ready for fancy cars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not the Maybach,&#34; Austin said, nodding toward a sleek silver-gray sports car parked at the entrance,clearly worth a small fortune. &#34;That&#39;s my practice car.It has solid performance.&#34;</p>
