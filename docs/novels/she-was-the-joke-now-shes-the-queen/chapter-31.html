                <p>&#34;Austin!&#34; Brinley, flustered, darted forward to snatch his phone, but in her rush, she nearly banged into the bedframe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s reflexes were sharp. He caught her wrist,and with a light pull, she stumbled down, ending up seated right on the edge of the bed beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The closeness made Brinley&#39;s senses whirl; she could pick up the faint scent lingering on him,see the playful curve in his eyes, even notice the length and thickness of his eyelashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart gave way, hammering wildly, as if it had broken loose from all control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still planning to grab my phone?&#34; Austin asked in a low, deep voice, sounding quite amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His warm breath swept past her ear, and Brinley shivered, her skin prickling from the sensation. Snapping back to herself, she yanked her wrist free and scrambled back across the room to the folding bed, diving under the blanket like a turtle retreating into its shell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You jerk!&#34; she shouted from beneath the covers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin chuckled at thesight of her curled up like a bundle, his eyes glowing with tenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set the phone aside, leaned back, and closed his eyes again. The faint smile on his lips remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hospital room had felt like their own little hideaway from the rest of the world for the past three days, even though there were still some interruptions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following afternoon, a woman in an elegant suit showed up at the door, introducing herself as a representative of a partner company and asking to see Austin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel stood firmly at the entrance and replied with a courteous but cold smile, &#34;Mr. Moore is resting. He won&#39;t be receiving visitors. I&#39;ll pass along your regards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman&#39;s lips parted, wanting to say something,but Miguel had already angled his body, signaling her to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, the Moore family&#39;s butler,Caiden Lopez, showed up as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He carried a food container in his hands, looking quite concerned. &#34;Austin&#39;s father sent me to check on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s just fallen asleep,&#34; Miguel answered, accepting the container with respectful firmness. &#34;I&#39;ll deliver his father&#39;s regards to him. Rest assured, the doctor said he&#39;s recovering well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden cast a look at the tightly closed door, sighed heavily, then turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Brinley sat quietly on the sofa, listening to the muffled exchange outside and realizing something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flipped through the magazine idly before asking in a casual tone, &#34;Your family situation seems...rather complicated, doesn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin lifted his gaze from the document, studying her.&#34;Why do you say that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw the butler from the window. His gaze toward the door was meaningful,&#34; Brinley replied, shutting the magazine and meeting his eyes squarely.&#34;Maybe because with a big, powerful family like yours, there are always relatives hoping to climb higher.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Austin was silent, then unexpectedly let out a laugh. &#34;You are actually perceptive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it&#39;s true, then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More than half of the Moore family is just waiting for me to fall,&#34; he said casually, as if he were speaking about someone else. &#34;What I have is far too enviable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley blinked at him, taken aback. She&#39;d known wealthy families could be complicated, but this level of ruthlessness was beyond what she imagined. She hesitated and asked in a quieter voice, &#34;I won&#39;t get caught up in it, will l?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin caught the wary expression on her face.She looked like a startled kitten, fur bristling defensively,and he couldn&#39;t help a quiet laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put aside the document in his hand and stretched out his palm. &#34;Come here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley scowled but reluctantly rose to her feet,moving over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held her hand gently, the warmth of his touch seeping into her skin, filling her with a sense of safety and assurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring deeply into her eyes, Austin said in an uncharacteristically serious tone, &#34;As long as I&#39;m here, no one can touch you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley snorted, tugging her hand back. &#34;Even without you, no one can touch me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she returned to the sofa, picked up her magazine again, and pretended to bury herself in it. But the faint flush creeping up her ears betrayed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin continued to stare at her in amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These days spent lying in bed might have been the most restful he had experienced in recent years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her by his side, even the pain dulled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sunlight pouring through the blinds stretched across the room, scattering warm golden shadows around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After spending one more day in the hospital for observation, Austin was finally discharged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley stood at the gates of Hillcrest Villa, her forehead slightly creased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s on your mind?&#34; Austin asked, his voice rough from illness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still weak, he leaned against Miguel for balance,his face pale from recovery, yet his eyes were clear and luminous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; Brinley blurted and turned away, clutching her phone, which still displayed a message from the butler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It read, &#34;The chef and staff have arrived. Dinner will be prepared according to Mr. Moore&#39;s dietary requirements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped the phone back into her pocket and asked in an airy voice, &#34;What do you feel like eating tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin replied with a smile, &#34;Whatever you cook will be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t even dream of it.&#34; Brinley shot him a glare.&#34;The doctor said your stomach lining is badly damaged. For the next three months, you&#39;re on light meals only. The chef is back, and he&#39;ll be handling your food from now on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added firmly, &#34;I won&#39;t be stepping into the kitchen again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There would be no more reckless experiments; she couldn&#39;t risk endangering him again. Seeing the indignation written all over her face,Austin melted into a smile. He already knew what was in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel had informed him that after learning her meals had caused his gastric bleeding, Brinley had stood in the corridor outside his ward, muttering for half an hour, &#34;It&#39;s all because my cooking is awful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Austin said gently, indulging her. &#34;I&#39;ll do as you say.&#34;</p>
