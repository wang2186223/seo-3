                <p>The staff at the City Hall adjusted his spectacles,peering at the copy of the marriage certificate again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, he spoke. &#34;Ma&#39;am, the document you&#39;ve presented is counterfeit. Our records show no marriage registration whatsoever between you and Mr.Colin Palmer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley stiffened when she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her mouth to speak, but no words came;her lips only twitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This... this can&#39;t be,&#34; she finally muttered, her voice almost inaudible. &#34;We were married here... two years agO...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff shook his head, looking sympathetic. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,but this is the truth: I can&#39;t find any information about your marriage in our system. If you believe you&#39;ve been deceived, it&#39;s best to report the matter to the authorities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nodding stiffly, Brinley accepted the copy of the marriage certificate as he handed it back to her. Her fingers trembled when they brushed its edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The document she had treasured for the past two years turned out to be fake.How preposterous!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the City Hall, Brinley halted on the steps, her head dizzyingly light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed time. She needed somewhere quiet to untangle the storm of thoughts threatening to consume her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wandered into a small café nearby and ordered an iced black coffee, strong and bitter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp taste filled her mouth, but it could not compare to the bitterness clawing at her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that very moment, her phone lit up with a message from Colin. &#34;Brinley, what would you like for dinner tonight? I&#39;ll pick something up after work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of nausea rose within her as Brinley stared at the message on her screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in a shaky breath, she typed, &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll cook.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost instantly, Collin replied, &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll be home on time after work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley didn&#39;t respond. Instead,she checked the clock; it was half past three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she decided to pay a visit to Colin&#39;s office without informing him beforehand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tech firm was located in a modern tower on the east side of the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had delivered him lunch there many times,enough that the receptionist recognized her at once and greeted her with a smile, waving her through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator carried her to the 28th floor, and she stepped out,following the familiar path toward Colin&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as she rounded a corner, the sound of his familiar voice drifted from the break room. &#34;I&#39;m conflicted,but you know... I just can&#39;t let go of Milly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley stopped in her tracks, her body stiffening as though the world itself had frozen around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quietly, she backed up and pressed herself against a column, straining to listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you intend to do,then?&#34; a man asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley recognized the voice immediately. It belonged to Vance Graham, Colin&#39;sclose friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you planning to stay with Brinley while marrying Milly Russell? Colin, that&#39;s not fair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words struck Brinley like a violent blow. She had to grasp the wall for balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly Russell? Who was she? Colin was marrying that woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each word felt like a blade slicing into her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it isn&#39;t fair,&#34; Colin admitted with a weary sigh.&#34;But when Milly left to pursue her career abroad, I was heartbroken.Then Brinley came along...she reminded me so much of Milly that dating her finally brought healing to my broken heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley bit her lower lip until she tasted the metallic tang of blood. She reminded him of Milly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was what she was? A substitute?</p>
