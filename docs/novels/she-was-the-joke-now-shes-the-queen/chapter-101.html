                <p>Colin&#39;s eyes were fixed on the racetrack, landing right on Brinley as she leaned from the window of the white race car, speaking intently with a technician. The bright lights caught her profile, her expression sharp and focused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked away after a moment, giving a small shake of his head before replying to Milly, &#34;No need. We&#39;ll stay here and watch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly stiffened, unease rising inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Colin all too well. Outwardly he carried a gentle demeanor, but deep down he admired strength and daring. If he truly saw Brinley&#39;s performance on the track...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a wave of cheers swept through the stands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley had already climbed back into her car, securing her helmet and snapping the visor down in one smooth,determined motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin&#39;s eyes remained on the white vehicle, his curiosity clearly piqued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight made Milly&#39;s chest tighten with discomfort, her smile freezing, barely holding together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An announcement boomed over the speakers. &#34;Attention racers, the final is about to begin. Please proceed to the starting grid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Side by side, the black and white cars rolled into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the window, Austin&#39;s reflective visor caught the light, hidinghis expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley gazed straight ahead, her fingertips tapping lightly against the steering wheel, as if measuring timing and angles in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the stands, the betting frenzy doubled again. Some fans believed Nightblade would win, while others had switched sides, shouting Brinley&#39;s name instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then the final began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dozen cars exploded off the line like arrowNs from taut strings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the very first corner, two cars collided in their fight for the inner lane, sparks flying and drawing gasps from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley jerked the wheel sharply, slipping past the wreck with inches to spare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Ballard seized the chaos to his advantage, swerving aggressively into her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her white car lurched violently, swaying so close to the safety wall it nearly clipped it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin shot up from his seat, gripping the railing so hard his knuckles whitened. His chest tightened at the sight of Brinley struggling within the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never before had he seen her like this-not the quiet, submissive woman who had once stood at his side,but someone fierce, wild, and untamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is she forcing herself like this...&#34; he muttered hoarsely, the words dragging out of him unbidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly heard, and her nails dug deep into her palm, though her face carried feigned concern. &#34;Racing is too dangerous, Colin. Look at this madness. Maybe we should leave before something happens?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Colin ignored her completely, his eyes locked on the track.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories from the past flooded his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled Brinley once smiling and telling him, &#34;Let&#39;s have a baby.&#34; And yet, at that very time,he had been wrapped up in Milly&#39;s softness, turning cold and dismissive toward Brinley. The sting of that realization cut into him now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had pushed away the one-of-a-kind Brinley. Meanwhile,the race raged on. Dominik intentionally blocked Brinley&#39;s line on a slow corner, trying to run her wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brinley downshifted hard, the car skidding at a razor-sharp angle across the asphalt before hugging the inside lane and shooting past him cleanly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beautiful move!&#34; The crowd erupted into their cheers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up in the lead pack, Austin&#39;s black car held position. In his mirror, he saw the white blur cutting closer and closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Ballard had cut her off earlier, Austin&#39;s foot had hovered over the accelerator, ready to break formation and shield her. But then she countered with a flawless rear-wheel drift, fending for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when Dominik tried to trap her again, he had been about to slow down and intervene, but Brinley&#39;s perfectly timed downshift had been smoother than even he&#39;d expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s fingers froze on the wheel, his eyes narrowing behind the visor. That fearless cornering angle,that split-second timing on the gear shift, even the precision of her grip...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no mistaking it. She moved with the unmistakable flair of Rosara, the racer who had once set the track ablaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no doubt now-Brinley was Rosara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that realization, Austin slammed the accelerator. The black shot ahead-not to win, but to test her limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The final entered its last three laps. Only five cars remained on the track.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley had climbed into second, pressing hard at Austin&#39;s tail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ballard, blinded by rage, veered recklessly on the straight, swiping toward her with the intent of knocking her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Careful!&#34; Colin shouted, his voice hoarse, betraying his concern for Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s eyes flew wide, her reaction kicking in almost automatically. She yanked the handbrake, spun the wheel, and sent her car into a perfect sideways drift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using the car&#39;s inertia, she threaded through the tiny gap between Ballard and the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The movement was so swift it was almost impossible to track. By the time the crowd caught up, Brinley&#39;s white car had already slipped past Ballard, now just half a length behind Austin&#39;s black car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Insane! She&#39;s even wilder than Rosara ever was!&#34; Nicolas whooped in the monitoring room, slapping the table with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin felt the pressure mounting from behind and, for the first time that day, smiled faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed harder on the accelerator but deliberately left a sliver of space at the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not as a mercy, but as a challenge.A chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley caught it instantly, seizing the opening without hesitation. Side by side, the black car and the white car tore into the bend together.</p>
