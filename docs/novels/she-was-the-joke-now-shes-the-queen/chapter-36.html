                <p>The swing rocked lazily beneath the leafy shade of the garden, lulling Brinley into a deep, untroubled sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in her dreams, she was oblivious to the passage of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the study, Austin sat stiffly, half-listening to his father&#39;s steady voice, though his gaze strayed again and again toward the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley had vanished for nearly an hour now, and an unshakable tension coiled in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s on your mind?&#34; Westley caught the flicker of distraction and lowered his teacup with a soft clink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing,&#34; Austin answered quickly, forcing his attention back. &#34;I was just thinking about some company matters.&#34; Another thirty minutes crawled by, and still Brinley did not return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin rose abruptly, unable to stay seated any longer. &#34;Dad, I&#39;m stepping out for a moment,&#34; he muttered,already striding toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once outside the study, he questioned the servants scattered in the living room, but every one of them shook their heads-they hadn&#39;t seen Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his search, Carolyn let out a cutting laugh.&#34;Maybe she couldn&#39;t handle our family&#39;s atmosphere and slipped off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryder added with a hint of reproach, &#34;It&#39;s her first time here. You should have kept her company,Austin. What if she&#39;s already lost?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s jaw tightened, his eyes darkening with unspoken worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sprawling Moore Estate stretched far and wide.Its gardens were divided into sections to the east,west, and south, with winding paths and several deserted rock gardens where one could easily vanish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin pulled out his phone, his tone sharp and unyielding as he issued the order. &#34;Miguel, pull up the surveillance-I want Brinley located now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel flinched at the command and hurried to call the Moore Estate&#39;s security room without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, the estate stirred to life-servants rushing down corridors, bodyguards scattering through the courtyards and gardens, every corner of the property combed with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Westley&#39;s brows knit together as he ordered Caiden,the butler, to help with the search.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the threshold of the main building, Austin stood rigid, his eyes sweeping the endless stretch of gardens. Each passing second made his chest tighten, a relentless knot winding tighter, suffocating him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>brought Brinley here at all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, a bodyguard sprinted across the lawn,breathless and wide-eyed. &#34;Sir, we found your wife-she&#39;s... she&#39;s asleep behind the rose trellis in the west garden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crushing weight in Austin&#39;s chest finally loosened. Without hesitation, he strode swiftly toward the west garden, every step fueled by raw relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From across the garden, he spotted Brinley curled up on the swing, her head tipped against the thick rope,lips parted slightly in a drowsy sigh, lost in peaceful sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped closer, his movements soundless, then crouched beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lashes fanned across her cheeks, throwing feathery shadows, and the faint blush on her nose made her look like a small, contented kitten soaking in the warmth of a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pang of regret stabbed through him-why had he  The restlessness that had been gnawing at Austin melted, replaced by a swell of quiet tenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley,&#34; he murmured, stretching out his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingertips brushed her cheek, coaxing her awake.She shifted against the swing, lids fluttering before she blinked at him through the haze of sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Austin?&#34; Her voice was low and husky, roughened by slumber, her unfocused eyes trying to catch hold of him. &#34;Why... why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I hadn&#39;t shown up, you&#39;d probably have slept until morning,&#34; Austin said, his voice laced with weary amusement and a touch of fondness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley jolted fully awake, blinking in confusion before realizing she was the center of attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ring of bodyguards and servants surrounded her,and Byron stood nearby with several Moores who had all rushed over at the commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every one of them stared at Brinley as if she were some rare curiosity on display. Not far off, Caiden&#39;s expression twisted with poorly suppressed laughter, the corners of his mouth twitching despite his effort to stay composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat flared in Brinley&#39;s face until her cheeks burned crimson, and she longed for the ground to simply swallow her whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did it strike her: on her very first visit to her husband&#39;s family estate, she had dozed off on the garden swing and sunk into a deep, unguarded sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34; Brinley parted her lips, searching for an explanation, but every word she tried to form felt clumsy on her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on.&#34; Austin rose smoothly, offering his hand with quiet certainty, &#34;We should head back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley wavered for a breath, then slipped her hand into his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grasp was broad and steady, carrying a faint,cooling warmth that eased the tension knotting in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he guided her toward the path, she became achingly aware of the eyes trailing after them,heat crawling up her neck until her cheeks burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a spectacle she had made on her very first appearance at the Moore Estate. She could already imagine the laughter whispered behind fans and wineglasses, her nap becoming tomorrow&#39;s favored joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they returned to the main building, Westley studied them briefly but chose not to mention Brinley having dozed off in the garden. Instead, he said in his steady voice, &#34;It&#39;s late, Austin. Don&#39;t drive back tonight-stay here and head out tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden quickly added with a grin, &#34;Exactly. You don&#39;t come home often. Stay, and I&#39;ll have your room on the third floor made up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryder and Carolyn echoed the suggestion, their cheerful tones carrying a hint of  Brinley suspected they were eager to see if she and Austin would share a room; if they didn&#39;t, Ryder and Carolyn would use it as a weapon to target them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s eyes drifted to Brinley, his expression gentle yet full of respect. &#34;What do you think-should we stay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stiffness in Brinley&#39;s chest loosened under his considerate gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dipped her head slightly and murmured,&#34;Whatever you decide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s mouth curved intoa small, approving smile before he turned to Westley. &#34;Then we&#39;ll stay the night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face lit up as he declared, &#34;Excellent! I&#39;ll make the arrangements at once!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Moore famnily&#39;s grand residence stretched across four floors, each space meticulously designed to reflect their wwealth and heritage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the ground level were the living room, dining hall,forced politeness. and a series of leisure rooms meant for hosting guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second and third floors housed Westley along with the rest of the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fourth floor was entirely reserved for Austin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Caiden escorted them up the sweeping staircase to the third floor, Brinley found herself pausing, struck by the realization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire floor stretched into more than a dozen suites,each lavishly furnished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From every window, a sweeping view of the Moore Estate&#39;s garden unfolded-endless manicured lawns and winding stone paths in perfect symmetry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll be staying in the master bedroom.Everything has already been arranged,&#34; Caiden said with quiet deference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s pulse stumbled when her eyes landed on the master bedroom-only one enormous bed dominated the space.</p>
