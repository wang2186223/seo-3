                <p>Once breakfast was over, a nurse came in to replace Austin&#39;s IV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His complexion looked steadier, though the pallor hadn&#39;t quite left his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the nurse stepped out, Miguel slipped inside,carrying a stack of documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Moore, these need your signature,&#34; he informed,setting the papers neatly on the bedside table before lowering his voice. &#34;A handful of media outlets wanted to talk to you this morning about your hospital stay. I shut them down. The Moore family also sent someone to check if you required assistance, but I turned them down for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s ears twitched at the mention, though she kept her gaze locked on the glossy pages of her  magazine, pretending she hadn&#39;t heard a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34; Austin&#39;s expression didn&#39;t shift. He picked up a pen, signing the papers with crispstrokes.&#34;Turn them away. Let my father know I&#39;m alright and I&#39;ll come back in a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel inclined his head. &#34;Understood,&#34; he replied before quietly retreating from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room settled into silence once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley flipped through her magazine a little too loudly, her mind snagging on Miguel&#39;s earlier words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Moore family... She had only ever read about them in financial reports-an empire sprawling and intricate, far removed from the comparatively straightforward Shaw family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the signatures were complete, Austin became aware of her distant stare. &#34;What&#39;s on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing.&#34; Brinley snapped the magazine shut and rose to her feet. &#34;I&#39;ll get you some water.&#34; On her way to the dispenser, her thoughts refused to quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why on earth had the Moore family merely sent someone to inquire instead of being there to tend to Austin themselves?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The indifference felt strangely cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Brinley didn&#39;t linger on the thought and brushed it aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, just after the nurse finished changing the IV, Austin suddenly tensed, pressing a hand to his stomach with a sharp intake of breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley, who was clearing away the plates, spun around at the muffled sound of pain. &#34;Is it flaring up again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; he muttered, sweat dotting his pale forehead.&#34;It&#39;ll ease soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not convinced, she rushed to his side, lifting her hand toward his forehead. Before she could touch him,he seized her wrist. A feverish heat radiated from his palm as he gripped her hand hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need to call anyone,&#34; he rasped, his voice rough.&#34;I know myself well enough; this isn&#39;t a big deal.If the doctors show up, they&#39;ll fuss over me, draw more blood, and order another round of tests. Too much hassle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But sometimes hassle is necessary.&#34; Brinley tried to yank her hand free, but his grip only tightened. &#34;Let go-I&#39;ll call the nurse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley.&#34; Austin lifted his eyes to hers, the haze in them softening his features like a wounded hound.&#34;Just stay with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The raw plea in his gaze, that unguarded dependence, turned her refusal into a lump she couldn&#39;t force out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a quiet sigh, taking in the drained complexion of his face before lowering herself into the chair by his bed, leaving her hand resting in his. Silence wrapped around them, broken only by the steady beeping of the monitors and the faint rasp of his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A blend of antiseptic medicine and the warm trace of cedar clung to him, strangely grounding rather than unpleasant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you always have stomach problems?&#34; she ventured, her words reaching to fill the awkward silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has for years.&#34; Austin&#39;s eyes dropped to their intertwined hands. &#34;Work devoured most of my time.I often skipped meals, and eventually it turned into this chronic mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind replayed images of him in late-night meetings, posture rigid, voice unwavering, his focus unbroken until exhaustion claimed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory stirred a pang of sympathy within her. It was a stark reminder that even the most unyielding men could be broken by illness. &#34;Promise me you&#39;ll eat properly from now on,&#34; she murmured, her tone softening. &#34;Don&#39;t push yourself past the limit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet laugh slipped from Austin, but the motion strained his stomach, forcing him to catch his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley stiffened at once. &#34;Does it hurt again?&#34; she asked,her voice tight with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing.&#34; He gave a slight shake of his head,though the worry in her eyes softened something in him. &#34;With you looking after me, I wouldn&#39;t dare skip another meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rushed to her cheeks as she snatched her hand back. &#34;Who said I would be looking after you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed herself up, reaching over to tidy the plates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s gaze followed her retreating figure, the curve of a smile lingering on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As night deepened, Brinley had just unfolded the makeshift bed when a muffled cough drew her  attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up to find him staring at the ceiling,a faint crease marring his pale face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; she inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a little chilly.&#34; He tugged the quilt higher,his voice even but touched with a thread of weakness.&#34;It&#39;s probably the antipyretic kicking in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After lingering for a heartbeat, Brinley crossed to the wardrobe, pulled out a spare blanket, and draped it carefully over him. &#34;Better now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin cocooned himself in the softness, giving a small nod. &#34;Much better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned back toward her own bed, but his voice followed her, low and sudden. &#34;You toss and turn a lot when you sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, Brinley halted abruptly and looked back at him. &#34;I caught you mumbling in your sleep last night,&#34; Austin continued, his mouth curving in a sly grin.&#34;And you kicked the blanket so hard you nearly sent the folding bed&#39;s rail flying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color rushed to Brinley&#39;s face, every part of her wanting to vanish into thin air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had dreamed last night-of baking cookies that ended in disaster, the oven blowing up in her face.Somewhere in the chaos, she&#39;d been chasing something, maybe even kicking wildly in her sleep...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just making that up,&#34; she countered, her voice sharp with stubborn pride. &#34;I always sleep soundly.I don&#39;t dream.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin casually lifted his phone, twirling it between his fingers before holding the screen toward her with a teasing smile. &#34;Care to see the proof?&#34;</p>
