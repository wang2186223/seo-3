                <p>The car eventually rolled to a stop in front of a grand villa perched midway up the hillside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villa stretched out broadly, its glowing lights bright against the night, almost like a modern-day castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve arrived,&#34; Austin said as he stepped out first,circling around to open the door for Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped down gracefully,raising her head to take in the imnposing edifice. For a moment, she was struck with a mixture of awe and unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was her new home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike the house she once shared with Colin, this villa was unquestionably more opulent, yet at the same time strangely foreign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin, standing side by side with Brinley now,said in a low voice, &#34;From today onward, this is your home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley turned her head to study him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the glow of the villa&#39;s lights, his profile  appeared prominent and dignified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a small nod and followed him inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she took in the interior decor, she was surprised to find that his house was both modest and elegant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned, studying Austin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could this man-with such a gentle look-be the same ruthless figure the public feared?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,perhaps this calm side of him was nothing but a front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing up, Brinley caught a glimpse of Austin&#39;s collarbone revealed by the slight shift of his suit collar. The sight made her swallow unconsciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t deny he was indeed an attractive man.But she still felt a deep, instinctive caution. This was someone she needed to keep her distance from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Moore,&#34; Brinley said, trying to stay calm,stopping at the base of the curved staircase, &#34;since this is a marriage of convenience, I think it&#39;s better we establish some clear boundaries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin leaned lightly against the banister, tilting his head to look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft light spilling from above threw his sharp face into shadow and glow-his nose high, his lips sharply defined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes, always carrying that trace of a smile,glimmered now with amusement. &#34;Go ahead, I&#39;m listening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley straightened her shoulders, trying not to be unnerved by his gaze. &#34;First, we don&#39;t interfere in each other&#39;s private lives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused briefly before continuing, &#34;Second, we keep our finances separate. Neither of us will touch the other&#39;s assets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she lifted her chin, glaring into his eyes. &#34;Third, if we ever divorce, we&#39;ll part on good terms-with no complications.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush settled over the hallway for a mnoment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Austin suddenly laughed, the deep sound echoing warmly through the stairwell. &#34;Don&#39;t you think you&#39;re being a little too cold with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a few strides and stood in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley caught the scent of cedarwood clinging to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember, we&#39;re legally husband and wife now,&#34;Austin said. Brinley&#39;s heart gave a small jolt, and she instinctively stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin looked fierce and intimidating like a predator advancing towards its prey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you should understand that this is just a partnership, and there are no feelings attached,&#34; she said, trying to stay calm. &#34;I don&#39;t want unnecessary trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking amused, Austin studied her stiff face.He chose not to press harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out, as if to brush the strand of hair resting near her forehead, but midway he stopped and said teasingly, &#34;Trouble? Is that what you think I am?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s voice had a subtle trace of lust in it. He made no move to touch or hold her, yet somehow,Brinley felt heat creep up her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s settled,&#34; Brinley said firmly, turning her face aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin gave a helpless shrug, lifting his hands as if in surrender. &#34;Alright, as you wish, my dear wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounded quite natural when he addressed her teasingly as &#34;my dear wife.&#34; Brinley acted as though she hadn&#39;t heard a thing,quickly moving past him up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villa had three floors. Austin mentioned that the guest rooms on the east side of the second floor offered the best light and comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brinley didn&#39;t stop to glance at the options;she continued upward to the far end of the third floor,where a modest wooden door marked the attic space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened it to reveal a room with a lofty ceiling,slanted roof beams, and aged wooden floors. A tall window framed the northwest horizon, the view expansive and quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This one,&#34; she said calmly. &#34;I like the vintage feel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, she simply wanted the room farthest from his master bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin leaned casually against the doorway, smirking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do have unusual taste,&#34; he remarked, eyeing the slanted roof.&#34;But in the winter, the drafts will be harsh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter,&#34; Brinley replied coldly without looking back. &#34;I can manage the cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She began to settle in, but her stomach betrayed her with a sudden growl. Austin puckered a brow, amused. &#34;Hungry?&#34; he asked playfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nodding without hesitation, Brinley replied, &#34;Yes. I didn&#39;t eat properly at the party.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then come on,&#34; Austin said, straightening himself.&#34;Let&#39;s get you something to eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley imagined there must be a professional chef waiting in such a luxurious home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet when she followed him into the kitchen,she was surprised to see Austin himself shrug out of his jacket,draping it over a chair. He reached for an apron hanging on the wall, tying it neatly around his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, he looked nothing like the intimidating man he usually was when he wore suts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin rolled up his sleeves, revealing strong forearms,and began pulling fresh ingredients from the refrigerator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley paused at the doorway, stunned into silence,as he set a cut of beef on the chopping board. The knife in his hand gleamed under the light, slicing the meat into thin, even strips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without glancing up, he called out, &#34;What are you doing just standing there? Come help.&#34; Brinley arched an eyebrow but stepped forward,accepting the onion he handed her. She washed it briskly and began chopping it.</p>
