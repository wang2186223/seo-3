                <p>Brinley was so stunned by Austin&#39;s shamelessness that her cheeks burned a vivid red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snapped her head to the side to avoid his intense gaze, blurting out in a flustered voice, &#34;Austin, you are such a tease!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Austin chuckled, the vibration of his laugh traveling from his chest into the narrow space between them, rippling through her like a current she couldn&#39;t escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re legally married. A little closeness is nothing unusual,&#34; he said, his tone light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; Brinley reached up quickly to cover his mouth,but Austin caught her wrist mid-air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His palm was warm and firm, the grip not forceful,yet enough that she couldn&#39;t break free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were so close that Brinley could catch his clean,refreshing scent and even notice the subtle rise and fall of his Adam&#39;s apple</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pulse hammered in her chest, erratic and  overwhelming,making it almost impossible to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her face away, she whispered with a voice barely audible, &#34;Let go... What if someone comes in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s there to be afraid of?&#34; Austin leaned closer,his lips brushing near her ear as he laughed softly.&#34;We&#39;re not doing anything inappropriate, are we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warm brush of his breath sent a jolt through her,her body going rigid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shoved against him with sudden force, finally breaking free of his embrace, retreating to the edge of the bed like a cornered animal, and glaring at him with caution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin watched her, amused at her overreaction,but he didn&#39;t push her further. Instead, he sat up casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll stop teasing you,&#34; he said, reaching out to ruffle her hair in a gesture that felt both natural and disarmingly gentle. &#34;You should get ready. The doctor will be by for rounds soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden tenderness caught her off guard, leaving her stunned for a beat. When she came back to herself, her cheeks heated again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Awkwardly, she swatted his hand away, tossed the blanket aside, and rushed into the bathroom. Closing the door behind her, she leaned against it,covering her flushed cheeks with both hands, her heart still pounding wildly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The closeness they had shared, the smile in his eyes,the seriousness in his voice-it all lingered in her mind like an imprint she couldn&#39;t shake</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, she turned on the faucet and splashed cold water over her face, desperate to calm down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she looked up at the mirror, her reflection betrayed her-rosy cheeks, a flustered expression,nothing like the composed and decisive professional she was known to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at herself in the mirror, and for a moment,an unexpected wave of uncertainty swept over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What exactly was her relationship with Austin?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it still just an arranged marriage, or... were they slowly becoming a real couple?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she actually beginning to catch feelings for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she stepped back into the room, Austin was already dressed, lounging on the couch with a document in hand. The morning sun streamed through the window,outlining his tall figure in light, accentuating the strong lines of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His focused expression gave him a unique charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he heard the sound of her emerging, he raised his head, his eyes settling on Brinley as a faint smile tugged at his lips. &#34;Finished?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Brinley answered stiffly, moving to sit back down on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, a knock came at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nurse pushed in a cart. &#34;Good morning,Mr. Moore,Mrs. Moore. If today&#39;s final check goes well, the doctor says you can be discharged, Mrs. Moore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good to hear. Thank you.&#34; Austin got up immediately, taking the cart from the nurse. She gave a polite nod and slipped out, leaving the room to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the door clicked shut, the atmosphere tensed up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin rolled the cart closer to the bedside table.&#34;Enjoy your breakfast. It&#39;s all the things you like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley looked at the carefully prepared breakfast,and a warm feeling bloomed in her chest. He always remembered her preferences, even down to something as simple as breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up the spoon and ate slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin didn&#39;t disturb her. He sat nearby,watching her quietly,occasionally offering a tissue or pouring her a glass of water, his gestures considerate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, the doctor arrived for his rounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The examination confirmed Brinley&#39;s wound was healing well,with no sign of infection. She was cleared to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley let out a breath she hadn&#39;t realized she was holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hospitals made her restless, and sharing a room with Austin only heightened her unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin stepped out to take care of the discharge paperwork while Brinley gathered her belongings in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler had only sent over a few changes of clothes, so it didn&#39;t take her long to finish</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By then, Austin was already back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34; He picked up her bag and naturally reached for her uninjured hand. Brinley instinctively tried to pull away,but his grip only tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t struggle. There are plenty of people outside.If any reporters see you injured, it&#39;ll just stir up ridiculous stories,&#34; he said in a voice that was low but imposing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley paused. He wasn&#39;t wrong. The online uproar about her hadn&#39;t died down yet. If anyone saw her bandaged arm, who knew what wild rumors might spread?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, she allowed him to hold her hand, letting him lead her out of the hospital room.</p>
