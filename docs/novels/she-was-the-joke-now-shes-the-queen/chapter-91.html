                <p>Miguel pulled up just as Austin and Brinley stepped out of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Parked at the entrance, the black Maybach&#39;s sleek lines spoke of understated class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Miguel climbed out to open the rear door, his gaze snagged on their linked hands. A flicker of surprise passed across his eyes before he quickly masked it. &#34;Good morning,Mr.Moore, Mrs. Moore,&#34; he said smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin gave a curt nod and guided Brinley inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they settled into the leather seats, Brinley&#39;s brow furrowed with a sudden thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured, &#34;What about my car...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been towed and sent for repairs,&#34; Austin cut in,placing a water bottle in her hand. &#34;Over the next few days, I&#39;ll either drive you to the construction site myself or have Miguel take you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, his tone deepened. &#34;Milly hasn&#39;t been entirely dealt with yet. I&#39;m concerned about your  safety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of Milly made Brinley&#39;s protest catch in her throat. She found herself unable to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the scare the day before, she couldn&#39;t shake off the faint chill of unease that clung to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The accident had failed to seriously hurt her, which meant Milly was probably still lurking in the shadowS,waiting for another opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her safety was a genuine concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Brinley murmured at last, giving a small nod.&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin let out a light laugh and reached over, ruffling her hair in a warm, almost teasing gesture. &#34;Don&#39;t thank me. We don&#39;t need that kind of formality between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His easy affection startled her. Heat rushed to her face,and she quickly turned toward the window to hide the blush creeping across her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beyond the glass, the city stretched wide beneath the blaze of sunlight, cars weaving in steady streams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet her heart was caught in a swirl of conflicted emotions. The relationship between her and Austin felt more intimate than before, as if an invisible line drawing them closer with every moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This new intimacy wrapped her in a nervousness edged with hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car rolled to a smooth stop outside Hillcrest Villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they stepped out, the butler greeted them warmly,&#34;Welcome home,Mr.Moore,Mrs. Moore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin acknowledged him with a nod and guided Brinley inside. &#34;Have they prepared lunch already?&#34;he asked,glancing toward the dining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all prepared,&#34; the butler replied</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Brinley crossed the threshold of the living room, the rich, mouthwatering scent wrapped around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dining table gleamed with plates of food that had been carefully arranged, each one tailored to her taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of the meal, so thoughtfully prepared, sent a gentle warmth through Brinley&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever lay ahead between her and Austin, at least right now, the care he showed her was unmistakably real. &#34;Come on, wash up first, then we&#39;ll eat,&#34; Austin insisted, setting her bag down on the sofa before gently steering her toward the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she returned with freshly washed hands, Austin was already seated at the table, waiting with patient ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nudged her plate of ribs closer and said with quiet insistence, &#34;Taste this and tell me what you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley lifted her fork, picked up a rib, and took a slow bite, savoring the rich flavor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sause spread warmly across her tongue, and the tender meat slid cleanly off the bone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is amazing,&#34; she said with genuine delight, her eyes lighting up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her enjoyment, Austin&#39;s lips curved into a gentle smile. &#34;Have more if you like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They ate in companionable silence, sunlight spilling through the floor-to-ceiling windows and bathing the table in golden warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quiet ease of it all left Brinley faintly spellbound,as though they were just a regular couple enjoying a plain but contented life. Once lunch ended, Austin left to handle company affairs,while Brinley returned to her room to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her back pressed to the headboard, she reached for her unfinished book, &#34;Racetrack Engineering Analysis,&#34; yet her eyes skimmed the page without absorbing a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts kept drifting back to Austin-his smile,his quiet tenderness, the firm decisiveness he carried,and the closeness they had shared in the hospital room that morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley dragged her fingers through her hair in frustration, then flung the book aside with a sharp thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To distract herself, she reached for her phone,meaning to scroll through the news, and was startled to find the tide shifting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smear pieces about her had thinned out, replaced by headlines on the Palmer Group&#39;s projects facing regulatory probes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s counterattack was clearly beginning to take effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milly and Colin seemed tangled in their own mess,leaving her a rare moment of ease. A soft sigh slipped from Brinley, relieved she didn t have to fend off their schemes for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Switching apps, she opened a racing fonum for updates on the exhibition race</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her surprise, the threads were buzzing with her name alongside the elusive Nightblade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have news about Brinley. She&#39;s been hurt-and itt appears to have been deliberate sabotage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That poor girl-just stepping into therace took guts.and now someone&#39;s already targeting her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still, do you think she can really race? She&#39;s just a rookie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who knows? But I respect her for trying. At least she&#39;s brave enough to race.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; wonder whether Nightblade will actually show up People are saying his spot&#39;s already secured&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way! If that&#39;s true, this race is going to be incredible. Nightblade was unbeatable in his prime!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Imagine if he and Brinley go head-to-head.I&#39;d pay good money to see that showdown,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Nightblade was mentioned, a sharp glint lit Brinley&#39;s eyes. Could he really be making a comeback on the track?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would the moment come when they finally stood as rivals on the same ground?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she rewrite the regrets that had haunted her for years?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resolve surged through her chest, hardening her gaze with newfound fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether Austin was Nightblade or not, she had to claim victory in this race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only to prove her worth to the world, but to honor the part of herself she&#39;d once left behind.</p>
