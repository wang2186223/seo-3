                <p>Austin sat quietly beside Brinley, not saying a word throughout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When others had criticized her, he had subtly slid his chair closer and brushed his knee against hers,as though to wordlessly show his support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at her calm face, he now smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His dear wife hadn&#39;t let him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley, sensing his eyes on her, turned to glare at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had clearly known that some of the Moores were set on giving her trouble, yet he hadn&#39;t given her the slightest warning. Obviously, he wanted to see how she handled it. How maddening!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after thinking it over, she had to admit that  Austin&#39;s approach had its merits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By holding back, he had given her the chance to stand strong in front of the Moore family and even win Westley&#39;s approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tactics were ruthless indeed. No wonder his family wasn&#39;t close to him. Who could truly embrace someone so sharp and calculating?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the butler came in to announce that dinner was ready, and everyone moved to the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the meal, the mood lightened a little, though a subtle awkwardness lingered in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few relatives began small talk with Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carolyn also approached, taking Brinley&#39;s hand warmly as she asked about her skincare routine and hair salon, acting as though the harsh-tongued woman from earlier was someone else entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Corbett, nudged firmly by his father, dragged himself over to share a drink with Brinley. He forced out a stiff smile, but his eyes still carried a defiant spark. Around the table, some people huddled in small groups, whispering while stealing glances at Brinley,their faces filled with curiosity, envy, and speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Others acted as though she wasn&#39;t there, chatting amongst themselves, making it plain that they had no intention of being connected to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley felt drained dealing with them. It was more exhausting than sitting through three back-to-back meetings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, she understood why Austin preferred staying in his villa rather than coming back to the Moore Estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very air in this house seemed to reek of scheming, and each conversation felt like a hidden trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the gathering began to disperse, Briseis had a word with Brinley. She brought out the scarf that Brinley had gifted her and said with a smile, &#34;You have great taste, Brinley. I&#39;ve been searching everywhere for this one.&#34; &#34;I&#39;m glad you like it,&#34; Brinley answered with a polite smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t take Carolyn&#39;s words to heart,&#34; Briseis added in a quieter voice. &#34;She only cares about money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley gave a small nod without replying further. She wasn&#39;t sure whether Briseis was being sincere or simply testing her, but at least Briseis was friendly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Brinley felt suffocated by the entire gathering,as if caught in an invisible net.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men retreated to the study to talk business,while the women lingered in the living room for idle chatter, their eyes frequently darting toward Brinley with thinly veiled judgment and calculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding her teacup, Brinley felt her fingers turn cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not used to this kind of setting. Every word she spoke felt like balancing on a blade, afraid that one misstep could turn her into a target and, by extension, bring trouble to Austin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Austin had been called away by Westley to the study, Brinley was left alone and restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to use the restroom,&#34; she said as she rose to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of going to the restroom, Brinley turned back the way she had come and walked toward the back garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The afternoon sunlight streamed through the lush foliage, scattering dappled shadows along the stone pathway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She deliberately avoided the servants, following a small pebble path until she reached a quiet corner screened by a rose-covered trellis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There stood an old wooden swing, its paint faded but carefully kept clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley sat on the swing and let it sway/, enjoying the moment of stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out her phone, she opened her chat with Miguel and typed, &#34;Send me the details of the Moore family ties; make it as detailed as possible.&#34; Miguel&#39;s reply came quickly. &#34;Give me a moment.I&#39;ll put it together now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A file soon landed in her inbox, spanning more than a dozen pages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley scrolled through the file, her frown growing heavier with every page she read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Moore family truly was a century-old dynasty branching out like a massive tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Westley and his late wife, Selene, had five sons and two daughters. Austin, the youngest, happened to be the same age as Ryder&#39;s son, Corbett.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The file also noted that Selene, already older when she bore Austin, had died giving birth to him.①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of this, Westley doted heavily on Austin,indulging his every wish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Austin&#39;s siblings treated him differently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eldest brother, Byron, was calm and even-tempered, always unreadable and giving away nothing of his true stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His second brother, Ryder, was openly ambitious,aimed to take over as family patriarch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His third brother, Blaine Moore,had settled overseas,remaining neutral in the family disputes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fourth brother, Kendrick Moore, was a scholarly type, uninterested in power struggles and on good terms with Austin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eldest sister, Briseis, had married into another wealthy family. She was opportunistic and calculating,always weighing profit and advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His second sister, Clarice Moore, was gentle and one of the few who showed Austin genuine affection,though her poor health kept her in a sanatorium much of the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a tangled web,&#34; Brinley muttered, rubbing her temples as a headache started to form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped her phone back into her pocket, shut her eyes tightly, and continued rocking gently on the swing.</p>
