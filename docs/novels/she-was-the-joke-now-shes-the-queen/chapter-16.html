                <p>Brandon walked Brinley and Austin to the door after dinner, his expression stern as he clapped Austin on the shoulder. &#34;Take good care of my daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin met his gaze steadily and said with quiet sincerity, &#34;You have my word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ride back carried a different air-lighter, free of the earlier tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As streetlights and buildings blurred past the window,Brinley leaned against the glass, her heart still holding the warmth her father had left there moments before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the silence, Austin&#39;s voice cut in, teasing.&#34;Tell me,have you been avoiding me lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s stomach lurched, but she forced a calm smile.&#34;Why would I? I&#39;ve been drowning in work-l can hardly breathe, let alone make time to avoid you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting his head, Austin leaned in, closing the space between them in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The subtle scent of cedar clung to him, warm and clean, while his eyes glimmered with amusement. &#34;Is that so?&#34; he murmured. &#34;Funny, though-every time I&#39;m in the living room, you suddenly remember urgent overtime. And on the stairs, you always bolt past me with your head down. Doesn&#39;t that sound a little suspicious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath skimmed across her cheek, sending her pulse racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up close, his appeal was almost disarming-the sharp line of his nose, the curve of his mouth, and those fathomless eyes that seemed intent on unraveling every secret she tried to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tore her gaze aside, struggling for composure.&#34;You&#39;re reading too much into it. I&#39;ve just been..really busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; His voice dropped, husky with an edge that pulled at her. &#34;Because I can&#39;t shake the feeling it&#39;s about what happened in the study...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; she blurted, cutting him off, heat rushing to her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to linger on the subject, she fumbled for an escape. &#34;We&#39;re home-let&#39;s get out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting, she all but bolted from the car,retreating into the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s eyes lingered on her retreating figure as he  let out a quiet chuckle, his gaze softening with unmistakabletenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back within the villa&#39;s walls, Brinley still felt frustrated about her hasty escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did he always manage to keep the upper hand?The more she dwelled on it, the more her irritation grew, until she silently swore she&#39;d seize the upper hand at the very next chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From behind her came his calm, unhurried voice. &#34;The pool is freshly maintained. Want to give it a try?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spun around to find him leaning lazily against the stair railing, a knowing smile playing at his lips, as if he&#39;d caught her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of determination surged through her chest.&#34;Fine,&#34; she answered, her tone brisk.&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, dressed in her swimsuit, Brinley stepped out to the poolside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin was already there, running a towel through his damp hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loose white towel clung precariously at his hips,showing the sculpted lines of his back and the hard ridges of his abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beads of water traced the dips of his muscles,sliding  downward until they vanished at the towel&#39;s edge,sketching an outline that was almost too enticing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pulse quickened despite her effort to remain composed.Determined not to let his presence rattle her,she walked steadily toward the pool&#39;s edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been watching me for three minutes straight,&#34;Austin drawled suddenly, his voice laced with playful tease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley blinked at the sudden remark but kept her face serene. Rising on her toes, she let her fingertips skim across his hard abdomen, her voice lilting with playful provocation.&#34;With a body like this, you could easily walk a runway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand lingered at his Apollo&#39;s belt, brushing the taut warmth there before she added with a sly smile,&#34;Though I have to say-touching it feels even better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s Adam&#39;s apple shifted with a swallow, his gaze sharpening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for her wrist, only for Brinley to slip away with a quick flick</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arching a brow, she tilted her head at him. &#34;Isn&#39;t this exactly what you like? Then why the sudden blush?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving him a chance to respond, she turned sharply, her silhouette trailing like a final stroke of elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin stayed where he was, watching her retreat with a shake of his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze dropped to the towel drawn taut across his hips, and he let out a low, self-mocking laugh before striding to the poolside shower and twisting the knob to unleash a rush of icy water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, Brinley pressed her back to the closed door of her room, her heartbeat racing as if she&#39;d just run a mile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even she hadn&#39;t expected her daring move at the pool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingertips brushed the heat in her cheeks, the image of Austin&#39;s sculpted body and the ripple of his muscles beneath her touch replaying vividly in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A muffled cry slipped past her lips, and she quickly clapped her hands to her burning face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why the hell was she so easily tempted by Austin&#39;s looks?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breathing gradually evened out. The flustered gleam in her eyes hardened into determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave herself a stern reminder not to falter. Colin had once been the same-lavishing her with affection, making her feel as if she&#39;d discovered love that would last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet in the end,his half-hearted wavering between her and Milly destroyed everything, leaving only misery behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin seemed more reliable than Colin, but who Ccould say what schemes hid behind his calm exterior?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a marriage of convenience, a fact she could never allow herself to forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley shook her head as if to scatter the jumble of doubts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drifted to the window, where the last light drained from the sky, her feelings a tangled knot she couldn&#39;t quite name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Austin stepped from the cold shower,droplets clinging to his skin as he faced the mirror. His cheeks still carried a faint flush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a helpless smile tugging at his lips, he muttered under his breath, &#34;Brinley, you really know how to turn me on.&#34;</p>
