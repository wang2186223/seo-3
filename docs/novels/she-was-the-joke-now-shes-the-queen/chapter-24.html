                <p>Brinley cleared the dishes, then sank into the sofa,her mind wandering before she finally pulled out her phone and dialed her father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call connected almost immediately, and Brandon&#39;s warm, buoyant voice filled her ear. &#34;Brinley,what&#39;s got you calling your dad tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to ask you something,&#34; she said, drawing in a steadying breath. &#34;What&#39;s really behind this arranged marriage to Austin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end,silence stretched for a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brandon finally spoke, his tone had shed its cheer. &#34;Brinley... there are things you&#39;re old enough to hear now.&#34; He hesitated, as though weighing each word, then continued with a grave slowness, &#34;That winter, Austin&#39;s mother-Selene Moore-was in a devastating car accident. Your mother risked her life in the pouring rain to drag her back from death&#39;s door.Out of gratitude, Selene had gone so far as to suggest a marriage alliance between the two families.You&#39;re the only daughter in our family, and the only fitting partner the Moore family could offer was their  youngest son, Austin1.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s breath caught, her fingers curling tight around the phone as if anchoring herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All these years, the Moores never pursued any other match for Austin,&#34; Brandon went on, a weary helplessness threading his words. &#34;Because they&#39;ve been waiting for you. Even when you were with Colin,Austin&#39;s father, Westley Moore, came to me personally.He said that if you ever changed your mind,the arrangement would still be honored.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh slipped from Brinley, soft but laden with resignation. So that was the truth behind it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reclined against the sofa cushions, eyes tracing the gleam of the crystal chandelier above her,her chest knotted with a swirl of emotions too tangled to name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was why the engagement had never been dissolved during her two years with Colin. It finally made sense why Austin, of all people, would agree to a union that looked so mismatched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything traced back to that long-ago promise, to the moment her mother risked her life to save another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps-Austin&#39;s gentlenesstoward her-his overprotective patience and indulgence-wasn&#39;t affection at all, but repayment of that unshakable debt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the truth settled in, the storm in her chest quieted at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, I get it now,&#34; Brinley said softly into the phone.&#34;I&#39;ll come by to see you soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the call ended, she let the phone slip from her hand and drew her knees close, curling up on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe this marriage wasn&#39;t such a terrible thing after all-more like a practical partnership where neither owed the other anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fatigue settled over her like a heavy blanket, and she let out a quiet yawn as her eyelids drooped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nestled deeper into the cushions, cheek pressed against the pillow&#39;s softness, and drifted off into sleep on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no idea how much time passed before the faint sound of the door opening stirred the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin stepped into the living room and spotted Brinley curled up on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her arms clutched the pillow tightly, her face tilted toward the fabric, lost in peaceful slumber. Moving softly across the floor, he leaned down and laid his suit jacket gently over her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley stirred in her sleep, curling instinctively toward the comforting heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The innocent motion tugged at Austin&#39;s composure,and his mouth curved in a quiet,helpless smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered himself beside the sofa, fingertips hovering just shy of brushing her cheek, lingering in the air as though afraid to break the spell,before pulling back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you drift off here?&#34; he murmured, voice no more than a breath as he slid an arm beneath her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was feather-light in his hold, curling against his chest like a small, trusting cat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment he rose with her cradled in his arms,her lashes fluttered and her eyes snapped open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is it?!&#34; Brinley&#39;s hoarse voice cracked from sleep as she jolted awake, thrashing instinctively.Her elbow slammed into Austin&#39;s chest with surprising force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s me, Austin,&#34; he grunted, his breath hitching as he tightened his hold to keep her from slipping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her eyes finally focused and she recognized him,  relief flickered across her face, quickly replaced by embarrassment. She shoved at him with both hands and feet. &#34;I&#39;ve got legs of my own; let me down already!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop moving-the floor&#39;s slick,&#34; Austin warned, his tone firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had the words left his mouth than his lower back struck the sharp edge of the coffee table with a solid thud, driving a groan out of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden imbalance pitched Brinley forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, the world seemed suspended in stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips brushed against Austin&#39;s in an unplanned collision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stiffened,caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He breathed in the fragrance of her hair and tasted the sweet remains of pumpkin soup on her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That accidental kiss sent subtle tremors through his chest,unsettling emotions he hadn&#39;t expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though it lasted only a few fleeting seconds,the moment stretched endlessly, as if time refused to move. Brinley jolted back to her senses, shoving him off and stumbling several steps away, her cheeks burning crimson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Austin! You...you shameless rogue!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She jabbed a trembling finger at him, though her heart was a whirlwind of confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That kiss just now-why hadn&#39;t it felt wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin didn&#39;t move. His hand lifted to his lips, as if the warmth of her mouth still lingered there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he watched her flushed, indignant face, a faint spark of amusement flickered in his eyes. &#34;I didn&#39;t do it on purpose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You call that an accident? And yet we kissed?&#34; Her voice spiked, her chest heaving as her heartbeat thundered against her ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wild, foolish thought darted through her mind-what if the kiss had gone on longer?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant the notion surfaced, she crushed it with merciless self-reproach. &#34;Brinley, have you completely lost it? Actually wishing to kiss Austin even more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley refused to glance back at Austin, sprinting up  the stairs as though a pack of wild beasts were nipping at her heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside her room, she slammed the door and pressed her weight against it, gasping for air,her heartbeat racing so violently it felt ready to burst from her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She darted into the bathroom and twisted the cold faucet open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The frigid stream splashed over her trembling hands,sending shivers down her arms but anchoring her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she slipped into the tub filled with icy water, letting the chill bite into her skin, desperate to drown out the reckless flutter pounding inside her heart.</p>
