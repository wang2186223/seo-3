                <p>Three months later</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek black Maybach rolled to a stop outside the glittering club, its polished surface catching every shard of neon light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brinley stepped gracefully from the car, her eyes lingered on the grand entrance, ablaze with chandeliers and flashing lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, the Knight family&#39;s annual charity gala was underway, drawing in the wealthiest and most influential figures in Bleron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Old memories pressed in, bitter and sharp, tugging a sarcastic curve at Brinley&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Shaw, you&#39;ve finally arrived.&#34; Ryan Bailey, the Knight family&#39;s longtime butler, hurried forward with quick precision, flanked on both sides by two lines of imposing bodyguards. Every gesture radiated deference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley tilted her chin and gave him a faint, cold nod in acknowledgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan gestured politely. &#34;This way, please,&#34; he said,  moving ahead while those bodyguards followed, their presence alone drawing stares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of Brinley&#39;s identity, they bypassed the main hall and slipped through a private passage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her quiet request, Ryan waved off the bodyguards,but their absence did little to lessen the attention she attracted. Her arrivalstill turned heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Draped in a bold crimson gown with her hair swept into a sleek ponytail,Brinley radiated confidence-elegant and arresting in her simplicity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition rippled through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that Brinley?&#34; someone whispered, awe and curiosity threading through their tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my, what is she doing here? Since when did the Knight family&#39;s gatherings become open to just anyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard Colin tossed her aside after catching her cheating. It was a whole spectacle. How does she still have the audacity to show up tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh,keep your voice down. She used to be the apple of the Shaw family&#39;s eye, but they&#39;ve cut her off completely... Look at her, still carrying herself as if she matters.&#34; The sharp whispers rippled through the hall and drifted to Brinley, yet she remained unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling elegantly into a quiet corner,she sampled the appetizers with calm detachment. Her serene poise only made the gossipers more irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the front of their little pack was Renee Dale,daughter of Dale Group&#39;s CEO.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly smile curving her lips and a glass of wine poised in her hand, she swept toward Brinley, her companions trailing behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee&#39;s voice carried deliberately, her smile sharp as glass. &#34;Well, if it isn&#39;t Miss Shaw. All by yourself tonight? Where&#39;s Mr. Palmer? Oh, that&#39;s right-I heard the two of you split. Hardly shocking. A man like him could not tolerate a partner who was unfaithful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Brinley could answer, one of Renee&#39;s companions leaned in eagerly. &#34;Renee&#39;s right. No offense, Brinley, but do you really think showing up here will win Mr. Palmer back? That ship has sailed.Milly&#39;s the one by his side now-she&#39;s carrying his child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp exchange only stirred the crowd further,hungry for drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley tilted her head just enough to meet Renee and her entourage with a cold glance. &#34;You all seem awfully fascinated with my personal life,&#34;she said, her tone deceptively gentle but edged with steel. &#34;My affairs, however, aren&#39;t open for your judgment. And as for why I&#39;m here...&#34; Her lips curved into a wry smile. &#34;Does the Knight family need your permission before extending an invitation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee faltered,her face reddening with fury. &#34;Brinley,get off your high horse! Everyone knows about your scandal.How dare you show your face here? What,are you desperate? No man would ever want you now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s eyes hardened, her voice cool and measured.&#34;It&#39;s none of your business, Miss Dale.&#34; She tilted her chin ever so slightly, her tone laced with irony.&#34;Instead of wasting your time on me, perhaps you should pay attention to Dale Group&#39;s stock. Word is,it&#39;s been plummeting thanks to some very poor decisions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from Renee&#39;s cheeks. &#34;What are you talking about? That&#39;s complete nonsense!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley arched a brow, and replied evenly, &#34;Don&#39;t play dumb. You know exactly what I mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brushed Renee off with effortless grace, lifting a delicate pastry from the tray and taking a slow,unhurried bite as if savoring the sweetness more than the conversation. Across the hall, Colin was in conversation with a man,one arm draped possessively around Milly&#39;s waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned instinctively at the sound of the commotion,his gaze locking on a figure he could never mistake.A jolt ran through him, his chest tightening at the sight of Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without sparing Milly aglance, he strode straight toward Brinley despite the surprised onlookers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Colin?&#34; Milly&#39;s voice faltered, her smile freezing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression soured as her eyes landed on Brinley not far away, and she hastily hurried after Colin.</p>
