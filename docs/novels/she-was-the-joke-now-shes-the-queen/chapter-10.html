                <p>Austin cast a sidelong glance at Brinley before letting out a low chuckle. &#34;You handle that knife quite well.Did you often cook for Colin in the past?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley didn&#39;t bother looking up from the chopping board. She replied in a calm, almost indifferent voice,&#34;Yes, I did. But looking back now, I guess all that effort was nothing more than a waste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin arched a brow, mildly intrigued by her bluntness. &#34;Oh? Do you regret it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley gave a short laugh, brushing the diced onions aside with a casual sweep of her hand.&#34;Why should I?For someone so undeserving, it&#39;s best not to mention him at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s hand froze for a moment as he studied her.He looked curious. &#34;So indifferent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you expect?&#34; Brinley raised her head, a faint smile tugging at her lips. &#34;That I cry endlessly,playing out some melodrama of heartbreak?&#34; She gave a little shrug. &#34;When it comes to love, you gamble.Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. I can take the loss, and I know how to let go.&#34; Austin regarded her for a few seconds before breaking into an amused laugh. &#34;Interesting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley, uninterested in his teasing, reached for a green pepper. &#34;What else needs to be chopped?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Austin held her wrist firmly but gently. &#34;I&#39;ll take care of the rest. You should rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley quirked an eyebrow at him. &#34;Why? Do you think my cutting isn&#39;t good enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; he replied casually, releasing her wrist. &#34;It just struck me that this is our first night under the same roof.You shouldn&#39;t tire yourself out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley hesitated, then laughed softly. &#34;You do know how to be thoughtful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set the knife down, wiped her hands, and said lightly, &#34;Fine, I&#39;ll take you up on that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting time,she turned and ambled out of the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s deep eyes followed her, a faint smile lingering on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, he set three dishes and a soup on the dining table. &#34;Come, try them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley eyed the plates. One dish still had visible grains of sugar that hadn&#39;t melted. The broccoli was overcooked, its edges tinged with black. As for the stir-fried beef, half of it was charred to the point of being unrecognizable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked,momentarily speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, she asked dryly, &#34;You looked rather skilled slicing the beef earlier. But your cooking seemed...lacking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin was unfazed. &#34;I&#39;ve trained myself with the knife,but heat control isn&#39;t exactly my strength.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley was at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin continued to look at her, clearly waiting for her to try the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having little choice, Brinley picked up her fork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stabbed a piece of the blackened beef, raised it with a pointed look at Austin, who was untying his apron, and asked flatly, &#34;Are you trying to upset me with your culinary adventures?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin stopped wiping his hands and glanced up at her amusedly. &#34;You&#39;ve got quite the sense of humor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out a chair across from her, sat down, and picked up his own fork Brinley&#39;s eyes drifted to his forearm, where his sleeve was rolled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There,faint but unmistakable, was an old scar winding across the skin above his wrist bone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It contrasted sharply with his current gentleness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley recalled the rumors about his ruthless nature,and her fingers tightened around her fork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meal continued in a strange, heavy silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite its appearance, the food tasted far better than it looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley ate slowly, taking small bites and stealing glances at Austin from time to time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ate calmly, looking elegant even as he consumed his own burnt beef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because it was late, the household staff had already retired for the evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So after dinner,Austin carried the plates back into the kitchen himself and began washing up. Brinley stared at his retreating figure in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin, the man who dominated the business world of Bleron, personally cooking and even doing the dishes? Leaning back in her chair, Brinley watched as he moved beneath the warm kitchen light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As it appeared, the Austin everyone spoke of,heartless and untouchable, was not the same man right before her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her warm cheeks with her palms, silently reminding herself, &#34;Brinley, pull yourself together.Don&#39;t let appearances deceive you. No matter what,this is just a marriage of convenience. Don&#39;t let it become more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Austin finally emerged, drying his hands, his sleeves still rolled casually up his forearms, he looked serious, the playfulness gone. This was how he would look in a business meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that I&#39;ve returned, there are formalities to address,&#34; he said, leaning lightly against the kitchen doorframe, staring at her. &#34;Next week, we should visit your father. The wedding also needs to be properly arranged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s hand froze around her glass of water, her fingertips trembling slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set the glass down carefully, meeting his eyes.&#34;The purpose of this alliance has already been fulfilled.Informing our families is enough. There&#39;s no need for a wedding ceremony,is there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by &#39;no need&#39;?&#34; Austin frowned,approaching her slowly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faint cedar scent clung to him, blending with the traces of cooking smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if it&#39;s only a marriage of convenience, we will not skip our wedding,&#34; he said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley pushed her chair back, creating somedistance,and answered, &#34;My father is currently tied up with a major project. It&#39;s really not a good time...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry,&#34; Austin replied, cutting her off firmly.&#34;I&#39;ll have my assistant coordinate with your father&#39;s secretary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said it so naturally, as if the wedding were a matter already decided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In comparison, it made Brinley&#39;s reluctance appear suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes searched his, looking for signs of jest or calculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he looked dead serious-even earnest-as if this was simply the way things should be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, she said, &#34;I&#39;ll call my father first to see when he&#39;s available.&#34;</p>
