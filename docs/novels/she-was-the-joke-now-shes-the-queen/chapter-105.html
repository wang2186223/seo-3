                <p>In the shadowed parking lot, Austin held the car door open for Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was calm, but the chill in his eyes betrayed him. &#34;Colin looked like he was ready to tear you apart with his glare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s irrelevant to me now. Whatever he feels, it doesn&#39;t touch me anymore.&#34; Brinley eased into the passenger seat, buckling her belt with brisk, precise motions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin turned the ignition, his eyes flicking sideways to study her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was serene as she stared out the window, but he reached over suddenly, brushing his hand through her hair with quiet tenderness. &#34;Don&#39;t waste your peace on people who don&#39;t matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth of his palm sank into her scalp, softening the weight inher chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swiveled toward him, catching the playful glimmer in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you staring at me?&#34; she asked, her brows lifting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing.&#34; His hand slipped back to the wheel, though a faint curve lingered at his mouth. &#34;Just realizing got excellent taste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s chest gave a small flutter, and she angled her face toward the window, trying to hide the faint curve of a smile tugging at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sleek luxury car slipped effortlessly away from the racetrack, its hum blending with the hush inside the cabin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes tracked the guardrails flashing past, her thoughts wandering as silence pressed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s voice slid through the quiet, casual but edged with curiosity.&#34;What&#39;s on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled her gaze back, the faintest trace of irony tugging at her mouth. &#34;I was thinking about what just happened.Milly&#39;s victim act was embarrassingly unconvincing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin let out a low laugh, steering them onto a narrow,shaded road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Golden light slipped between the branches, painting the glass with broken patches of brightness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Colin isn&#39;t stupid-he&#39;s just tied to her because she is carrying his son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin cast her a quick look, approval flickering in his eyes. &#34;But you didn&#39;t fall into that trap. Smart of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley let out a short laugh, tilting her head with disdain. Her smile curved into something sharper as she lifted an eyebrow at him. &#34;You knew I was Rosara from the beginning, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s hand faltered on the wheel before he answered honestly, &#34;That last corner-you handled it exactly the way Rosara did back then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley narrowed her eyes. &#34;And yet you still played along, acting like you were clueless while testing me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I wanted to give you the chance to admit it yourself,&#34; Austin said with a low, amused chuckle. His gaze sharpened. &#34;And you? When did you realize I was Nightblade?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you let me pass those two cars on purpose.&#34; Brinley locked eyes with him, her lips curving into a confident smile. &#34;Nightblade&#39;s stye is distinct. Back then, I studied his footage over and over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words seemed to hang in the stillness of the car. The only sound between them was the rhythm of their breathing, and in that silence an unspoken connection pulsed, undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin eased the car to the roadside and stopped. With a deliberate motion, he unfastened his seatbelt and leaned toward her. &#34;Now that everything&#39;s out in the open... will you let me into your heart, Brinley?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pulse stuttered. Instinct told her to pull back, but his warm palm slid to cradle the backof her neck,grounding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley,&#34; he murmured, voice low and resolute. &#34;Stop avoiding me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s breath caught, her fingers curling into the leather seat beneath her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s nearness wrapped around her like heat, leaving her pulse unsteady. She turned her face aside, dodging his piercing gaze, and managed in a trembling voice, &#34;Austin, give me three days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand stilled, easing from the back of her neck with reluctant gentleness.Though expectation dimmed in his eyes, the lingering warmth never faded. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her chin, Brinley met his gaze with quiet resolve. &#34;I need those three days to think it through. Our past lives and present feelings are too tangled. I can&#39;t let impulse decide for me.&#34; Her lips pressed together before she added softly, &#34;When the three days are up, I&#39;ll give you my answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s gaze lingered on her, catching the unwavering determination in her eyes. At last, he gave a small nod and reached over, his fingers combing gently through her windswept hair. &#34;Then I&#39;ll wait for you,&#34; he said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The brush of his fingertips against her ear made Brinley jerk away as if the touch had burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amusement flickered in Austin&#39;s eyes, and he let out a low chuckle as he drew his hand back, snapping his seatbelt into place. The engine purred to life, his voice calm and measured once more.&#34;Shall I take you back to your office?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Brinley answered softly, her gaze shifting toward the windoW.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car slipped seamlessly into the flow of traffic, and the fragile spark that had hovered between them faded into silence-yet its aftertaste clung stubbornly, pressing itself into both their hearts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s gaze followed the retreating streets, her thoughts tangled in restless knots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had finally admitted the truth to herself-she wasn&#39;t just used to Austin&#39;s presence; she had already fallen for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was nothing like the gentle affection she once felt for Colin. With Austin, it burned fiercer, more intoxicating, Jike fire under her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that very intensity made her falter at the edge of the next step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if she chose wrong again?</p>
