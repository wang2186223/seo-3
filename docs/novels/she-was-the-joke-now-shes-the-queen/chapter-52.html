                <p>The afternoon meeting dragged on from two until six, only to be followed immediately by a video conference with the design institute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brinley finally had a moment to breathe, night had already settled in outside the windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rubbed at her aching temples as she stepped out of the meeting room and found Miguel waiting by the company entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Moore told me if you weren&#39;t done by eight, I should get you home no matter what,&#34; Miguel said awkwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley checked the time. It was nearly nine o&#39;clock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when she remembered the message Austin had sent that morning. It read, &#34;Come home early tonight; I have something to tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had replied casually, &#34;Okay.&#34; Then she had completely forgotten about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, let&#39;s go,&#34; Brinley said, opening the car door. The moment she sat down, her eyelids felt unbearably heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned against the back seat and closed her eyes. Her mind, however, wouldn&#39;t stop circling back to the design drafts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had dozed off until Miguel&#39;s gentle voice roused her. &#34;Mrs. Moore, we&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley opened her eyes and saw the villa&#39;s living room lit up, a soft golden glow streaming out through the floor-to-ceiling windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she opened the door and stepped inside, she saw that Austin was sitting on the sofa with a newspaper open in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re back,&#34; he said quietly, glancing up at her face. There was a hint of tiredness in his eyes, but no trace of irritation about her late return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley strode over. She asked softly, &#34;Were you waiting long?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not really,&#34; Austin replied, setting the newspaper aside and motioning to the seat next to him. &#34;Come sit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faint smell of tobacco mixed with the familiar cedar scent on him instantly eased the tension that had clung to her all day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How was the soup today? Did you like it?&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was good.&#34; Brinley stared into Austin&#39;s eyes, a feeling of unease creeping into her chest.&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why did you only drink the soup and leave the eggs untouched?&#34; he asked, sounding clearly displeased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley blinked in surprise. He even knew about that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her head, she whispered, &#34;I had the soup and then rushed to my meeting. After that, I got busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin gently tilted her chin up, making her look at him, the concern in his eyes unmistakable. &#34;Brinley, the project matters, but your health matters more. If you break down, who&#39;s going to see it through?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you&#39;re not,&#34; he said firmly, cutting her off.&#34;Look at yourself. Dark circles under your eyes, hands freezing cold. Keep this up, and you&#39;ll end up in the hospital before the project&#39;s done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley fell silent, lowering her head again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin sighed. Instead of scolding her further, he went to the kitchen and returned with a cup of warm water.&#34;Here. Drink this first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After watching her take a sip, he said suddenly, &#34;From tomorrow, you&#39;re to be home by eight every night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way!&#34; Brinley blurted out. &#34;Evenings are the only time I can revise the drafts. Eight is far too early.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then work on them the next day,&#34; Austin replied without hesitation. &#34;I&#39;ve already told Miguel to notify your  building management to cut the power after eight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Austin!&#34; Brinley gasped, staring at him in frustration. &#34;How can you do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He met her eyes, a resolute look in his. &#34;Either you come home on time, or I&#39;ll make sure your project doesn&#39;t move forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley studied his expression, knowing he wasn&#39;t bluffing. He was never one to go back on his word.Especially when it came to her, he was unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes stung as she glared at him. She knew he was worried, but the way he interfered so forcefully with her work left her feeling cornered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to reason with him. &#34;I&#39;m working on an important...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing is more important than your health,&#34; Austin said, reaching out and running a hand through her hair with such an unexpected gentleness. &#34;Make sure you look after yourself, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words carried such tenderness that they struck directly at Brinley&#39;s heart, and her anger melted like ice in the sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sniffed lightly and muttered, &#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin softened when he saw her give in. &#34;There&#39;s porridge in the kitchen, kept warm. Go eat some.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want any; I&#39;m not hungry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still need to eat.&#34; He stood, pulling her up insistently.therwise, I&#39;ll call your team right now and give them all a day off tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragged into the kitchen, Brinley watched him scoop a bowl of steaming seafood porridge from the pot. It was filled with her favorite ingredients, cooked until perfectly tender. The aroma alone was comforting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eat.&#34; Austin placed the spoon in her hand and leaned against the doorway, arms crossed, watching intently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley reluctantly lifted a spoonful to her mouth. The warmth spread through her stomach, easing the exhaustion and refreshing her almost instantly. She glanced up to see Austin watching her closely, a faint smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why aren&#39;t you eating?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll eat once you&#39;ve finished.&#34; Austin&#39;s reply was casual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Brinley said softly and continued eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The porridge was served at the perfect warmth-neither scalding nor lukewarm-showing it had been reheated more than once so it would be ready the moment she came home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only then that Brinley realized Austin hadn&#39;t had anything urgent to tell her. He just wanted to be there,making sure she ate.</p>
