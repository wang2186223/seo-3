                <p>Brinley lifted her gaze and met Colin&#39;s eyes, her tone steady but edged with resolve. &#34;Mr. Palmer, a racing project can&#39;t be judged by budget alone. Every fraction of added safety could mean the difference between life and death in a crisis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a few clicks, she displayed a chart on the screen and went on, &#34;Here are last year&#39;s global racetrack accident statistics. Nearly eighty percent of severe crashes happened in that twenty percent safety gap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grayson leaned forward at once, his voice firm. &#34;Mrs. Moore makes an excellent point. Safety is the line that can never be crossed in racing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What followed turned into a sharp exchange between Brinley and Colin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dismissed her operational model as overly idealistic, and she countered with precise customer-flow predictions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exposed the hidden flaws in his drainage design, while he fired back with supplemental test data to defend it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin positioned himself in the rear seats, quietly observing the sharp clash unfolding on stage. His hand tightened around his cup, and a shadow of displeasure lingered across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught the way Brinley&#39;s fingers tapped against the table whenever she gathered her thoughts, a small unconscious rhythm that betrayed her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin, meanwhile, couldn&#39;t help but flick his gaze toward her before every rebuttal, his eyes carrying emotions too tangled to decipher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the judges moved into the final voting stage, the hall grew so still that the scratch of pens against paper cut through the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, the seven judges recorded their scores. By the time the staff began tallying them, cold sweat had already traced down Brinley&#39;s back. Colin leaned slightly toward her, his voice low enough for only her to hear. &#34;I&#39;m confident this project is mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s eyes stayed fixed on the sunlight streaming through the window. &#34;Shut up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host broke the seal on the last envelope, and the room burst into gasps of surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s total came to 92.5-narrowly beating Colin&#39;s 92. It came down to half a point, the thinnest margin possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;According to the scoring rules, safety weighed heavier than cost control. By the slimmest of margins,VantagePath Realty takes the win!&#34; the host declared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall burst into thunderous applause, the sound crashing over Brinley like a wave. For a heartbeat she stood frozen, unable to process it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Corbin wrapped her in a jubilant hug, bouncing with unrestrained joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley, however, felt as if her strength had drained away, her gaze drifting instinctively toward the judges&#39;table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the sea of people, Austin&#39;s eyes found hers. He smiled warmly, his expression carrying a tenderness that seemed to spill beyond words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she stepped down from the stage, Colin waited at the bottom of the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His suit was creased, his tie askew, and the polish he always carried had completely unraveled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Half a point,&#34; he muttered, tugging at the corner of his lips as though forcing a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Palmer,&#34; Brinley said softly, her eyes cool as they met his. &#34;Your proposal was indeed meticulous.Unfortunately...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unfortunately, I don&#39;t really understand racing.&#34; His voice broke in, the dim light in his eyes betraying a quiet defeat. &#34;I thought commercial benefits were what mattered, but I forgot-the heart of this project is the track itself. Now I understand why we broke úp. When I thought stability was enough, I lost sight of what truly matters-that from the very start, love only survives on sincerity and honesty.&#34; The words struck Brinley like a sudden blow, and her expression frosted over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin continued, &#34;Brinley, we...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough,&#34; she cut him off, her tone sharp and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin parted his lips, ready to argue, but his gaze flicked past her shoulder. Seeing the figure behind her, he forced a thin, bitter smile instead. &#34;Goodbye,Brinley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned and walked toward the exit, every step weighted, his back bent as though the years had suddenly caught up with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s got you so lost in thought?&#34; Austin&#39;s voice rose gently from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley pivoted to find him standing there, a bouquet of bright sunflowers cradled in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing,&#34; she replied softly. Her fingers brushed his as she accepted the bouquet, and a wave of warmth passed between them. Somehow, the hollow inside her chest felt full. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly are you thanking me for?&#34; he asked, brushing a loose strand of hair from her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For the flowers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin dipped his head, studying her animated face before letting out a low chuckle. &#34;That&#39;s all I get? Just words?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cradling the bouquet, Brinley&#39;s gaze grew complicated, shadows flickering behind her eyes. &#34;As thanks,plan to buy you dinner tomorrow. Do you have time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of couurse, I&#39;ll make time for you.&#34; His laugh came easy, his eyes bright with amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley, however, looked away deliberately, refusing to meet the depth in his expression. &#34;Pick a time and send it over. There&#39;s still a site survey I have to handle, so you go back without me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising an eyebrow, he offered, &#34;I&#39;ll drive you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need. I need to bring Corbin and the others. I&#39;m heading out now.&#34; Without waiting for a reply, Brinley motioned for her teammates and strode off, her steps brisker than she realized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bouquet remained clutched tightly against her chest, her mind circling back to the dinner invitation for tomorrow. She felt the urge to sidestep it entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the project finally wrapped up, it was the right moment to sit down for a serious conversation with Austin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the thought of sitting across from him, laying it all bare, stirred a reluctance she didn&#39;t want to acknowledge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Austin&#39;s gaze followed Brinley until her figure was gone, the corners of his lips tightening into a faint, bitter grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Moore, should we...&#34; Miguel, hovering at his side, finally broke the silence. He had been waiting,restless, watching Austin stand rooted in place long after Brinley disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, his eyes shifted aside, his expression settling once more into that rigid severity.&#34;We&#39;re going back to the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, once outside the hall, Brinley waved off her team with a bright smile, tellingthem to unwind and enjoy the victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the dedication of the entire team that allowed them to secure this project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley, aren&#39;t you joining us for a meal?&#34; Corbin asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll pass. There&#39;s something else I need to take care of.&#34; With that, she offered them a gentle farewell before turning away, her steps carrying her alone toward the project site in the quiet stretch of the suburbs.</p>
