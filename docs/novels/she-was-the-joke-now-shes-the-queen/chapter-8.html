                <p>Austin was hardly ever seen at social events like this,so his appearance today caused a stir-people flocked to him one after another, eager to strike up conversations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley sat silently at his side, looking like nothing more than a beautiful ornament.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who knew who she was didn&#39;t dare approach too closely. They had witnessed the confrontation earlier and had no intention of provoking her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, Austin would have brushed off these flattering business talks with irritation. He had always kept others at arm&#39;s length.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But tonight was different. His attention never truly left the petite figure beside him-Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For over a decade he had been watching from a distance, and now, unbelievably, she was right here next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to use the restroom.&#34; Brinley leaned close and whispered into Austin&#39;s ear. She was restless from sitting too long. Austin responded in a low voice, &#34;Don&#39;t take too long,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a nod and walked out of the VIP lounge.Many pairs of eyes followed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After using the restroom, she stepped out, only to find a man reeking of alcohol staggering drunkenly into her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley...&#34; he mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley scowled the moment she recognized Colin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Palmer, please control yourself,&#34; she said, taking a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Colin tottered forward, reaching for her hand.&#34;Brinley, I&#39;ve realized how wrong | was! Give me another chance. I can&#39;t do without you. These three months apart... I&#39;ve missed you so much I feel like I&#39;m going mad!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; Brinley snapped. &#34;I don&#39;t want to hear any more of your nonsense. Colin, listen, we&#39;re done. Stay away from me, or I promise you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sounded cold and menacing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Colin falteredat the fierce glint in her eyes. But the alcohol clouding his judgment and the  fear of losing her made him reckless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lunged forward, trying to pull her into an embrace,even attempting to kiss her. &#34;Brinley, just gve me one more chance, please...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get lost!&#34; Brinley barked, swiftly dodging him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, in a flash, she drove her high-heeled foot into his abdomen with all the force she could muster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin let out a cry of pain, bending over and clutching his stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could recover, Brinley kicked him squarely between his legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; Colin screamed in agony, collapsing to the floor and curling up miserably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked ghostly pale, his shirt drenched in cold sweat. He could barely make a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The disturbance drew the attention of nearby guests,all looking stunned and intrigued</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley stared down at Colin with disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crouched and whispered close to his ear, &#34;Colin,take this as your warning. If you dare try this again,you&#39;ll regret it far more than you do now.&#34; Straightening, she smoothed her dress and strode away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance away,Austin had seen it all. He had just finished his conversation and now stood with his hands tucked in his pockets, watching Brinley leave.A faint,knowing smile played across his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wife was far more fascinating than he had imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the banquet was over, the guests began to disperse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brinley reached the exit, a sleek black Maybach pulled up to block her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The window slid down, revealing Austin&#39;s charming face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get in,&#34; he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley had a frown on her face. &#34;Mr. Moore, I have my own car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already had it sent back,&#34; Austin replied firmly. &#34;Now,get in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping a straight face, Brinley replied, &#34;I want to return to my own place.&#34; &#34;Your place?&#34; Austin blinked. &#34;Have you forgotten we&#39;re married? That means we&#39;re supposed to live together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No buts,&#34; Austin said, cutting her off. &#34;I prepared our new home three months ago. Now, you&#39;re coming back with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke in a domineering tone, yet oddly enough, it stirred no resistance in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley met his deep eyes, silent for a minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew he was the kind of man who demanded compliance and would not tolerate resistance. Besides,she needed a new beginning, a solid identity as Austin&#39;s wife, to truly free herself from her past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a steadying breath, she pulled open the car door and slid inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drive,&#34; Austin ordered the driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The black Maybach glided into the night, disappearing into the stream of traffic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back in her seat, Brinley stared at the neon lights flashing past outside the window. A swirl of emotions churned within her heart.</p>
