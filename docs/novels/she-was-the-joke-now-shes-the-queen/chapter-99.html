                <p>Reporters overwhelmed Brinley with relentless questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Moore, are you just entering this race to promote your real estate project?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some professional drivers claim you don&#39;t even understand the track rules. What&#39;s your response to that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s rumored that you stole a spot that should go to real racers. Care to comment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the sidelines, a few mocking shouts broke through the reporters&#39; questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go home and enjoy your life of luxury instead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does Mr. Moore know you&#39;re out here embarrassing yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley clenched the steering wheel tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered the car window, ready to respond, when her eyes drifted toward the shadowy area of the waiting zone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, a man stood motionless in a jet-black racing suit, fully covered from head to toe. The matte helmet revealed not a trace of skin, adding to his mystery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned against the railing with both hands tucked into his pockets, tall and straight, looking so intimidating that no onedared approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even at a distance, Brinley felt a strange, unmistakable sense of familiarity in that posture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, another driver approached him, dressed in the same style of racing suit, except for a flame emblem painted across his helmet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Nicolas Gomez, Austin&#39;s close friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following Austin&#39;s line of sight toward Brinley, Nicolas smirked, elbowing him lightly: &#34;Your wife really has guts. Racing isn&#39;t child&#39;s play. Let&#39;s hope she doesn&#39;t skid off the track; otherwise, I&#39;ll be the one calling a Austin didn&#39;t look at him. His voice came through the helmet visor, low and cold. &#34;That won&#39;t happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicolas arched a brow, ready to argue, but the broadcast cut in sharply. &#34;Attention racers, the first round is about to begin. Please prepare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley pressed down on the accelerator, guiding her white race car as it eased into the line moving toward the registration zone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff kept reporters and hecklers at bay, but their sneering looks and cutting remarks still reached Brinley, tightening around her like an unseen trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the trackside, betting booths were crowded with racers and spectators, all focused on the electronic screens as they placed wagers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s eyes flicked to the screen-next to her name were glaring odds of 1 in 100.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost everyone had bet she would be knocked out in the first round.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled down her helmet visor, shutting the world out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, there was only her breathing and the low rumble of her engine warming up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the staff confirmed her details, they signaled for her to move into the starting area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley shfted gears, eased off the clutch, and guided the white race car seamlessly onto the track.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the starting area, the other drivers were already lined up and waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just ahead at a diagonal, Ballard-the same one who had mocked her earlier-caught her eye through his window and mouthed,&#34;Last place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s grip on the wheel tightened, her eyes locked on the starting line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The green light was moments away. She inhaled deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d make sure they saw what she was truly capable of. When the signal light went dark, she released the clutch, yet instantly, the cars flanking her lunged inward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ballard on the left, Dominik on the right. Their cars pressed against her lane, their mirrors nearly grazing her doors, trying to shove her straight off thetrack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A harsh sound filled the air as tires screeched against asphalt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The white car jolted half a length back, teetering dangerously close to crossing the boundary line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grandstands burst with laughter and jeers. &#34;See? Told you Brinley couldn&#39;t handle it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She can&#39;t even start straight; what&#39;s the point of her being here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s heart skipped, but her instincts from years on the track steadied her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She deftly twisted the steering wheel, taking advantage of the pressure from both carsto cut sharply and slip through the narrow space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fell to the back, but her car regained balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flashed across Ballard&#39;s and Dominik&#39;s faces; they hadn&#39;t expected her to break free so cleanly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding her teeth, Brinley slammed harder on the accelerator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up in the stands, the betting screen refreshed, flashing updated odds beneath her name: Brinley Moore-Win Rate: 0.5%.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The betting amounts against her kept climbing; everyone seemed convinced she wouldn&#39;t last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Russell put money down that she&#39;d crash out in the first round; odds are 1 in 20!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bet she won&#39;t even survive the first curve. A rich lady like her can&#39;t handle this kind of heat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sneer touched Brinley&#39;s lips as she read the screen. She could feel everyone&#39;s dismissive gazes, all convinced she&#39;d never make it past the first round. Well, she&#39;d prove them wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered the first time she entered a track; the ridicule then was ten times harsher, yet hadn&#39;t she still carried home the championship? When the signal light went dark, she released the clutch, yet instantly, the cars flanking her lunged inward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ballard on the left, Dominik on the right. Their cars pressed against her lane, their mirrors nearly grazing her doors, trying to shove her straight off thetrack.</p>

                <p>&#34;She can&#39;t even start straight; what&#39;s the point of her being here?&#34;</p>

                <p>She fell to the back, but her car regained balance.</p>

                <p>Ballard on the left, Dominik on the right. Their cars pressed against her lane, their mirrors nearly grazing her doors, trying to shove her straight off thetrack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A harsh sound filled the air as tires screeched against asphalt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The white car jolted half a length back, teetering dangerously close to crossing the boundary line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grandstands burst with laughter and jeers. &#34;See? Told you Brinley couldn&#39;t handle it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She can&#39;t even start straight; what&#39;s the point of her being here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s heart skipped, but her instincts from years on the track steadied her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She deftly twisted the steering wheel, taking advantage of the pressure from both carsto cut sharply and slip through the narrow space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fell to the back, but her car regained balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flashed across Ballard&#39;s and Dominik&#39;s faces; they hadn&#39;t expected her to break free so cleanly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding her teeth, Brinley slammed harder on the accelerator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up in the stands, the betting screen refreshed, flashing updated odds beneath her name: Brinley Moore-Win Rate: 0.5%.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The betting amounts against her kept climbing; everyone seemed convinced she wouldn&#39;t last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Russell put money down that she&#39;d crash out in the first round; odds are 1 in 20!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bet she won&#39;t even survive the first curve. A rich lady like her can&#39;t handle this kind of heat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sneer touched Brinley&#39;s lips as she read the screen. She could feel everyone&#39;s dismissive gazes, all convinced she&#39;d never make it past the first round. Well, she&#39;d prove them wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered the first time she entered a track; the ridicule then was ten times harsher, yet hadn&#39;t she still carried home the championship? The red light vanished, and engines roared like thunder across the arena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Brinley let go of the clutch, Ballard on her left and Dominik on her right closed in like sliding walls, forcing her toward the middle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their side mirrors came so close they almost scraped her door, and the gravel sprayed up by their tires rattled sharply against her car&#39;s body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha-ha! That&#39;s more like it!&#34; someone shouted from the grandstand. &#34;Show her what real racing is!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat beaded on Brinley&#39;s palms, the steering wheel shuddering violently beneath her hands. But in that instant of chaos, she found her opening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slammed the brakes, the car jolting downward before she floored the accelerator in the same breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engine growled like a wild beast, and the white car shot forward at a ground-hugging angle,sliding between Ballard and Dominik in a daring move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smoke curled from her tires, the acrid smell filling the air. Before the spectators&#39; gasps even faded, Brinley was already surging ahead, catching the moment when the lead car slowed for the curve-and in one breathtaking maneuver, she overtook two cars in quick succession.</p>
