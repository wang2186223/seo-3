                <p>Marc&#39;s face darkened with anger as he turned to stare straight at Haley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s eyes filled with tears, but no matter how many times she shook her head, nobody believed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The recording Stella played was clear and impossible to deny. There was nothing Haley could say to get out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Marc, hoping for some support,but all she saw in his eyes was disappointment and cold disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly turned to Jazlyn, but Jazlyn had already stepped away, clearly not willing to stand by her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley felt crushed inside, but then she clenched</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her teeth and pointed straight at Jazlyn. &#34;Marc,it&#39;s not what it looks like! Everything I did... your mother told me to! You know she never liked Stella. She wanted you to leave her. She made me do this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words shocked everyone. Now all eyes were on Jazlyn, who stood frozen in her elegant dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re lying about me! I never told you to do anything like that. Stop blaming me without proof!&#34; Jazlyn was so angry that she completely lost her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reaction only made her seem even more out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jazlyn, don&#39;t lie now! You were the one who said Stella wasn&#39;t even able to have kids, that she didn&#39;t have the right background to be good enough for Marc. You told me to figure out a way to make her leave him on her own. This was all your idea!&#34; Haley shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t care anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t afford to lose completely, not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she had to sacrifice Jazlyn!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc looked at his mother with a chilling stare.It all made sense now. These were exactly the kinds of things she would say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So it was true-his own mother and Haley had planned this all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella stood quietly, watching them tear each other apart with a cold smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long ago, they were pretending to be one big happy family.Now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were crumbling from the inside, and she hadn&#39;t lifted a finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes remained distant as she held the recorder tightly in her hand, quietly taking in the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, back in his office, William was going through some paperwork when Luca came in holding a file. &#34;Mr. Briggs, Ms. Russell has already signed. Here&#39;s the contract.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William looked over the signature and instantly recognized Stella&#39;s neat handwriting. &#34;Did she ask for anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca shook his head. &#34;No, she signed it easily.Didn&#39;t ask for anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William wasn&#39;t the least bit surprised. That was just like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing that Luca hadn&#39;t left, he asked, &#34;Is there more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca paused, then said, &#34;Ms. Russell went to the Choria charity event by herself tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William stopped what he was doing, something shifting in his gaze. &#34;Was the Walsh family there too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca nodded. &#34;Yes, and there&#39;s already been</p>
                
                
                
                <p>some drama. Ms. Russell played that recording from the other day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William raised his brows in surprise. Stella had recorded it? That, he hadn&#39;t expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just imagining her handling it all on her own at such a big event made things a lot more interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was exactly the kind of bold move she would pull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William set his pen down and grabbed his coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca looked confused. &#34;Are you heading out,Mr.Briggs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William fixed his collar calmly. &#34;She&#39;s our partner now. We just signed that deal-if something happens to her, it could affect the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His explanation made sense, and Luca quickly nodded. &#34;I&#39;ll take you there,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the way, Luca kept sneaking glances at</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William in the rearview mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this really just about business?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, it didn&#39;t feel like it. He&#39;d never seen Mr. Briggs act like this over any woman-not until Ms. Russell.</p>
