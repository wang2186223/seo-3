                <p>Abroad Is Still Trash</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley was caught off guard. She didn&#39;t understand why Marc wanted her out. Still, she stood her ground.&#34;I&#39;m staying. Unless there&#39;s something you&#39;re hiding from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc shot her a bored look, not interested in arguing.Instead of replying, he turned his attention to a new message on his phone. It said Stella had gone up the mountain about an hour earlier and had lingered by the wish tree, apparently writing something again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He instantly recognized the location. They&#39;d been there together once. But why was she replacing her plaque now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts tangled into a knot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something didn&#39;t sit right, but he couldn&#39;t put his finger on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only option that made sense to him was tracking down Stella and figuring out what was really going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood abruptly, snatched his coat from the rack,and headed for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before stepping out, he picked up the office landline and contacted the legal department, instructing them to revise the contracts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke loud enough for Haley to hear, and the message hit its mark-her face flushed with embarrassment. Seeing Marc heading for the door without a second glance only fueled her irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marc, where are you going? What&#39;s wrong with the contracts? Did I mess something up?&#34; She reached out,trying to stop him, arms spread to block the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc walked right past her without acknowledging her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marc!&#34; she called after him, glaring as his figure disappeared down the hall. She stomped her foot,furious. He didn&#39;t even pause. He was completely ignoring her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the head of legal arrived,informed by colleagues that Marc had called. He took one look at Haley&#39;s stormy expression and silently grabbed the documents from her desk, choosing not to say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley,still fuming, chased after him. &#34;Hold on! I spent hours on those contracts! Why are you taking them back? You&#39;re nothing but a useless leech!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The supervisor looked fed up. He hadn&#39;t even pointed out how disorganized and unusable the contracts were,yet Haley was already bragging about how carefully she had prepared them. How clueless could she be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying nothing, the supervisor simply observed as Haley&#39;s eyes darted around the roomn until they locked onto Allegra.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley suddenly recalled that Allegra had some sort of connection to Stella. &#34;You! Yes, you! Aren&#39;t you in legal? Didn&#39;t you see the effort I poured into those contracts? You just sit there like a statue while I do all the real work. What does this company even pay you for-decoration? People like you are dragging us down. Effectve immediately, forget about getting a year-end bonus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew Haley was out to provoke someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allegra slowly rose from her seat and walked over,her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always been quiet, someone who kept her head down to keep her position. But things had shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After talking with Stella, she realized there was no point enduring a dead-end job just to say she had one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fancy office meant nothing if the one running it had</p>
                
                
                
                <p>no clue what they were doing. With a boss like that,her future would be stuck in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Smith,&#34; she began calmly, &#34;have you actually looked at those &#39;contracts&#39; you&#39;re so proud of? They don&#39;t even follow the company&#39;s basic formatting standards. You call that detailed work? It&#39;s laughable.Everyone knows you&#39;re from the Smith family but who would&#39;ve guessed your abilities would be this embarrassing? Honestly, a kid with half a brain could&#39;ve done better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room went silent. People stared at Allegra like they were seeing her for the first time. She&#39;d always kept her voice low. Where had this version of her come from?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You! Who do you think you are, talking to me like that? I&#39;ll have Marc fire you on the spot!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Allegra only chuckled. &#34;Too late. My resignation&#39;s already been submitted. If you&#39;re hoping to kick me out,you&#39;ve missed your chance. And since we&#39;re being honest,I can&#39;t stomach people who climb with favors and destroy families in the process. You tick both boxes. Also-newsflash-waving your foreign passport around doesn&#39;t make you special. Trash from abroad is still trash.&#34;</p>
