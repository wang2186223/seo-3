                <p>Before going to bed, Stella had made sure to lock the door from the inside, and not just that, she&#39;d even taken the spare key from the storeroom with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when someone tried to open the door in the middle of the night, it didn&#39;t budge. After a few moments of struggle, the person outside finally gave up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise had woken her. Lying in the quiet darkness,she stared at the ceiling, unable to fall back asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity got the better of her, and she checked the surveillance footage, and as expected-it was Marc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But by then,he was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing she had a full day ahead, Stella made herself close her eyes and tried to fall back asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, she got ready and headed straight to the research institute, brushing off everything Marc had said the night before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t the same wife he used to manipulate so easily. That version of her was long gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment she made up her mind, their marriage was over in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once at the institute, she threw herself into work and pushed everything about last night far from her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until her phone rang that she paused her work and looked at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name flashing on the screen was &#34;Allegra&#34;-someone from Marc&#39;s legal department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allegra had once helped Stella when the latter was at Marc&#39;s company, and Stella had always been polite and thankful for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her name pop up now caught Stella off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d only ever spoken for work, never anything personal, unless something unusual had happened...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a few uneasy guesses forming, Stella picked up the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Allegra, what&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allegra&#39;s voice cracked when she heard Stella. After a pause,she steadied herself and said, &#34;Ms. Russell, Mr.Walsh asked me to inform you that you need to come to the office today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice wavered. She already knew Stella didn&#39;t want to come, and there had been talk around the office about her turning down the renewal offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was a direct order from Marc, and Allegra had no choice but to follow it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Allegra. But I&#39;ve decided not to work with your company anymore, so I won&#39;t be coming in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allegra had guessed this might happen, but hearing it directly still left her feeling defeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Russell, I know you&#39;ve made up your mind, but Mr.Walsh said if you don&#39;t come, it would be considered my error,and I could lose my job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella frowned, stunned. &#34;Wait-are you saying Marc would fire you just because I refuse to come?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Russell, I know you don&#39;t want to come, and l understand. But I really have no choice. He said he&#39;d make sure no one else in the industry hires me. I know this is emotional blackmail... but it&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll find a way somehow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allegra choked on her sobs. She didn&#39;t want to make things worse for Stela, but she was stuck between loyalty and survival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s hands trembled with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc must&#39;ve figured out that she and Allegra got along and used that connection to trap her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He really would stoop to anything just to get his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so shameless that it almost made her laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Allegra&#39;s shaky sobs,Stella squeezed her eyes shut and said firmly, &#34;I&#39;ll come. Don&#39;t worry, Allegra.This isn&#39;t your fault-he&#39;s targeting me, not you.l won&#39;t let you lose your job over this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allegra&#39;s heart clenched at Stella&#39;s words. Her panic faded,replaced by gratitude, guilt, and a deep sense of unfairness on Stella&#39;s behalf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you... thank you so much, Ms. Russell!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella almost said there was no need for thanks-after all,Allegra had once helped her too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, she wasn&#39;t someone who forgot a kindness,no matter how small.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Marc wanted her there so badly, then fine. She&#39;d go.She wanted to see for herself exactly what kind of game he was playing now.</p>
