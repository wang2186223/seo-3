                <p>Without giving Marc&#39;s office a second glance,Stella composed herself and walked toward the legal department, as if she hadn&#39;t seen a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Marc happened to glance toward the hallway mid-flirt. His heart skipped a beat when he caught sight of Stella walking past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp breath lodged in his throat, and his smile instantly vanished, replaced by a grim scowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to leave. Now,&#34; he said curtly, the warmth in his voice gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley blinked in confusion, lips still curved in a teasing smile. &#34;What&#39;s gotten into you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip on her wrist tightened unintentionally,making her flinch in discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could press further, Marc stormed out of the room, his steps purposeful and tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught up to Stella, softening his voice.&#34;Stella, why are you here? What you saw back there... it wasn&#39;t what it seemed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella cut him off with a calm flick of her wrist.&#34;Relax. I get it-just work, right? You two enjoy yourselves. I&#39;m just here to handle the paperwork and go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was so casual it almost sounded like indifference, but the message was clear-she hadn&#39;t come to spy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Marc stood stiffly, the tension in his body betraying his guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the doorway, Haley peeked out and noticed their strained exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her manicured fingers curled into fists, while her eyes narrowed with suspicion and irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With deliberate elegance, she strutted toward them with a syrupy smile on her face. Tossing her curls, she purred in Achure, &#34;Marc, you were amazing last time. I haven&#39;t stopped thinking about it.Honestly, working with you is the best</p>
                
                
                
                <p>decision I&#39;ve ever made.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,shooting Stella a smug glance,she added with a wink, &#34;Sweetheart, I&#39;ll be waiting at the hotel. Got a surprise for you-brand-new lingerie, just how you like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, Stella knew Haley was being deliberately provocative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew full well Stella spoke Achure, and yet she flaunted it right there, loud enough for anyone nearby to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truly, the woman had no shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s jaw tightened, his expression darkening as he turned to respond-but Stella cut in again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lingerie? Really, Ms. Smith? Aren&#39;t you bold?Maybe I should remind you that Mr. Walsh and I are still legally married, and yet here you are,shamelessly throwing yourself at him. Where l come from, women like you have a name-homewrecker, or worse, a tramp.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spoke in clear Ushainese, loud enough for everyone to hear. The moment the words left</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her lips, the room fell silent, and all eyes turned toward her in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone already knew Marc and Haley were close,but no one expected them to flaunt it so openly,right under Stella&#39;s nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Haley trying to stir things up in Achure,thinking Stella wouldn&#39;t understand?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That level of arrogance was almost laughable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley, fluent in Ushainese despite her act,hadn&#39;t anticipated Stella firing back so sharply and so publicly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face flushed deep red. With everyone staring, she wished she could melt into the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stumbled over a feeble lie. &#34;Sorry, I... didn&#39;t catch what you said.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella chuckled coldly. &#34;Oh, that&#39;s no problem.I&#39;ll be happy to say it again-in Achure this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without blinking, she pronounced &#34;homewrecker&#34; and &#34;tramp&#34; in perfect Achure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s calm demeanor only made Haley&#39;s humiliation feel more severe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surrounded by stares, Haley felt like the ground was slipping beneath her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always been spoiled, used to being adored and protected, never once enduring this kind of public embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face twisted with rage, and with a shrill voice, she screamed, &#34;You frumpy old bitch!Who do you think you are? I&#39;ll kill you-&#34; She lunged forward, her hand raised to slap Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could land the hit, Stella caught it mid-air with a grip of steel, and without hesitation, slapped her-once, twice. Then she yanked Haley&#39;s hair and didn&#39;t stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slaps rang through the hallway, mingling with Haley&#39;s high-pitched shrieks, shattering the stunned silence of the office floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Marc&#39;s face contorted in panic.&#34;Stella! What the hell are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He charged forward and shoved her with force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden push caught her off guard. She stumbled, and her head slammed into the wall with a sickening thud. Pain exploded across her skull as the world tilted slightly around her.</p>
