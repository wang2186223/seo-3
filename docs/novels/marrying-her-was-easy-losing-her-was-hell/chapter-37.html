                <p>&#34;Ugh!&#34; Marc bent over as a wave of nausea swept through him, his gut twisting from the stench clinging to his soaked clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cleaning lady jumped back in alarm, her apologies tumbling out in a flustered rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc clenched his jaw, knowing that exploding at her here would only make him look even more pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there shivering, the icy,foul-smelling water seeping through every layer and sticking to his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, when his gaze drifted toward the restroom, his pride refused to let him retreat. With a sharp flick of his wrist, he shook off the cleaning lady&#39;s hand and snapped, &#34;Enough! Just go-don&#39;t bother me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cleaning lady blinked in surprise at his outburst.Taking in his pitiful state and stubborn refusal to leave,she silently concluded he really was a stalker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least that poor woman had managed to get away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having fulfilled her end of the deal, the cleaning lady hurried off, eager to put the bizarre scene behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc, left standing in a puddle of humiliation,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>awkwardly dabbed at his ruined shirt, his anger simmering just beneath the surface. Still, he stubbornly refused to budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Stella really think a cheap stunt like that would get rid of him? Not a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way he&#39;d believe Stella would actually hole up in a restroom all day just to avoid him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping out of the bustling mall, Stella finally breathed easier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t witnessed Marc&#39;s humiliation herself,but the mere thought of his uptight, obsessive self splattered with dirty water was more than enough to lift her mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc, of all people, loathed mess. The idea of him reeking and sticky, frantically scrubbing himself clean,almost made her laugh out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She headed for the curb, hand half-raised to flag down a taxi,when her phone buzzed deep in her purse.Pulling it out, Stella hesitated-an unfamiliar number flashed across the screen, but something about it made her skin prickle with recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered warily.&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A honeyed but sharp voice immediately cut in, all</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>going to keep pestering Marc? He&#39;s finished with you.Why don&#39;t you have a little dignity and let go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s words dripped with mockery, her supposed language barrier nowhere to be found. The performance was so ridiculous, Stella almost snorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A steely glint flickered in Stella&#39;s eyes as she answeed,her tone icy and unhurried, &#34;Maybe you need a reminder-Marc and I are still married, whether or not love is involved. The law&#39;s on my side. So tell me-who said you could call me up and start hurling accusations?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s lips parted, but nothing came out. For several seconds, she stood frozen, speechless. &#34;I&#39;m not here to fight with you. Why don&#39;t you come over so we can talk face-to-face? It&#39;s simple-the one who isn&#39;t loved is always the third wheel. Take my advice and know your place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold laugh slipped from Stella, mocking and sharp.&#34;Haley,is this really what the Smith family taught you?To meddle in other people&#39;s marriages and play the mistress? I guess when you&#39;re completely shameless,there&#39;s nothing left to lose. It&#39;s almost admirable,how you can spout this nonsense without a single scrap of dignity or self-awareness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s face twisted with fury. &#34;You&#39;d better watch your mouth!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella arched an evehrow thorouahlv uinimnressed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Haley honestly think she could intimidate her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got better things to do than play along with your bullshit. Maybe try focusing on the Walsh Group&#39;s plummeting profits instead of pestering me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s finger hovered over the screen, ready to end the call, when a cold, familiar voice cut in from the other end of the line, &#34;Stella, how could you speak to Haley like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Jazlyn-Marc&#39;s mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thin smile curled on Stella&#39;s lips. No wonder Haley sounded so bold. Clearly, she had Jazlyn backing her,ready to swoop in at a moment&#39;s notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn had never bothered to hide her disdain for Stella. From the beginning, she&#39;d seen Stella as a nobody, someone with no useful connections, no value to offer the Walsh family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with Haley in the picture, Jazlyn acted like a shameless flatterer, siding with anyone she thought could benefit her precious son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;d better show up right now,&#34; Jazlyn snapped,her voice laced with threat. &#34;Let me make this clear, Stella -clinging to my son will get you nowhere. You&#39;re nothing but a burden to our family. If you have any sense left, you&#39;ll come to the Voyage Hotel immediately. If not, you can face the consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella hadn&#39;t planned on indulging their drama, but at those words, her expression tightened. After a beat of hesitation, she set her jaw and changed course.</p>
