                <p>&#34;Now that you&#39;re officially part of Briggs Group, you&#39;ll be meeting clients often. Buy yourself a few new outfits, and make sure you represent the company properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s lips twitched faintly. So that was it-he thought she might embarrass the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced a smile as she accepted the card,then muttered through clenched teeth,&#34;Aren&#39;t you worried I&#39;ll drain this card dry, Mr.Briggs? You know how much girls enjoy shopping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William glanced at her begrudging expression and chuckled. &#34;Relax. Your salary&#39;s decent, and we&#39;ll just deduct it from that if needed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella sighed in defeat and shoved the card into her bag, clearly annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening her posture, she turned and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>walked out of his office, holding her head high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he watched her walk away, William felt his spirits unexpectedly lighten. Even the stack of reports in front of him didn&#39;t seem quite as tedious anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Stella stepped out of the Briggs Group building, she tried to soothe herself. Alright-at least she had a villa and a black card. That was more than most companies offered.Sure, her boss was a little odd... but tolerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the office, moments after Stella left,William&#39;s phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven&#39;s voice came through the line. &#34;This one&#39;s interesting. I can see why you picked her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t bother asking questions. He just responded coolly, &#34;Stay away from her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That only piqued Steven&#39;s interest further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh? So you&#39;re actually serious this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t react to the teasing.With eyes still on his screen, he said flatly, &#34;If that&#39;s all,I&#39;m hanging up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait-this is important,&#34; Steven cut in.&#34;You&#39;ll need to stop by in a couple of days to sign the contract.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven had no doubt about Nebula&#39;s proposal, especially now that Stella was involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no question in his mind-he was definitely signing with Nebula.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William gave a quiet hum of acknowledgment and, after ending the call,shot Stella a message wvith the contract signing date for SummitRise Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella was browsing racks of clothes when the message came through. With the black card in her hand, and knowing any overspending would just be docked from her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>pay, she shopped without the slightest guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After checking the contract date, she casually sent back an &#34;OK&#34; emoji and resumed her carefree shopping spree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day of the contract signing came quickly. Dressed in a sharp black business suit that gave her a sleek, polished look,Stella walked into the towering headquarters of SummitRise Group with quiet confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she stepped into the elevator and the doors began to slide shut, they suddenly reopened with a chime. Two people had pressed the button from outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows lifted slightly when she saw who it was-Marc and Haley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What were they doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t have time or energy to care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying a word, Stella shifted to the side, pretending she hadn&#39;t even seen them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc looked at her with a mix of restraint and barely hidden excitement. But unlike before,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he didn&#39;t come near her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley, on the other hand, had a different agenda. There was a satisfied curl to her lips as she stood beside Marc, her thoughts dripping with spite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had found out that Stella was scheduled to sign a contract with SummitRise today,and she&#39;d shown up for one reason only-to ruin her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had even hidden a tiny camera in her purse, ready to capture Stella&#39;s downfall on video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plan was simple-humiliate Stella, post the footage online, and let the world laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After this, Stella wouldn&#39;t just lose Marc-she wouldn&#39;t even have the dignity to walk around in public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella caught the calculating glint in Haley&#39;s eyes and narrowed her own slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were clearly plotting something, but</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she wasn&#39;t worried. Let them try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator ride was tense and silent. When it finally stopped on the conference room floor, Stella walked out, only to hear footsteps behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven stood by the meeting room entrance.He hadn&#39;t scheduled anyone else today, so when he spotted Haley and Marc trailing behind Stella, his brows furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Walsh, Ms. Smith,&#34; he said coolly, &#34;I don&#39;t recall setting up a meeting with either of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley immediately stepped forward, taking charge. &#34;Mr. Harrison, we&#39;re here to share something important. A truth, actually. We just didn&#39;t want you to be misled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven tilted his head slightly, an amused gleam in his eyes. &#34;Misled? And who exactly is trying to mislead me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley didn&#39;t hesitate. She pointed right at Stella, her voice rising with righteous indignation. &#34;Her, Mr. Harrison! She told you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she had some so-called new technology to collaborate on, but the truth is-it&#39;s stolen.She took confidential files from Walsh Group!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven raised his eyebrows and let out a soft chuckle. &#34;Is that so? Mr. Walsh?&#34; He turned toward Marc. &#34;Can you confirm this? Did Ms.Gilbert really steal trade secrets from your company? I&#39;m curious-how did she manage that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had expected Marc to show some level of dignity, maybe even hesitate before tossing such an accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Steven had clearly overestimated him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc looked at Stella with conflicted eyes that flickered with something unreadable.Then he said slowly, &#34;Yes, Mr. Harrison.She&#39;s my wife. And I can confirm that around six months ago, out of anger, she took classified documents from the Walsh Group and disappeared. If you don&#39;t believe me,check her ID. It&#39;s likely fake. If you proceed with this collaboration, you might find</p>
                
                
                
                <p>yourself tangled in legal trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley jumped in with even more dramatic flair. &#34;That&#39;s right. She&#39;s not Sylvia Gilbert-her real name is Stella Russell! Marc gave her a chance to work at Walsh Group out of kindness, and this is how she repaid him-by stealing sensitive data. And now she&#39;s using our company&#39;s core technology to strike a deal with SummitRise Group!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley accused Stella with self-righteous anger.</p>
