                <p>Even now, Marc remained convinced he hadn&#39;t done anything wrong. In his mind,everything he&#39;d done had been justified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He simply saw it as part of business-getting close to other women was just strategy. But in his heart, Stella had always been the only one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had stood by him for years. Surely, she should&#39;ve known his heart never wavered. At least, that&#39;s how Marc saw it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, here she was, using another name-Sylvia Gilbert, of all things-as if Stella Russell had never existed. To Marc, it was utterly ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Travis had heard enough. &#34;Marc,&#34; he cut in,his voice sharp. &#34;The Walsh Group made it big in Choria thanks to Stella&#39;s patents. Do you have any idea how much those patents</p>
                
                
                
                <p>could&#39;ve gone for? But because she trusted you, she didn&#39;t ask for a dime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was no secret. Everyone in Choria knew where the success really came from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s face clouded over. He turned a hard stare on Travis. &#34;What are you getting at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Travis hesitated, then exhaled. &#34;Marc, let&#39;s be real. Without Stella, you&#39;d have never made it here. Your reputation, your company&#39;s foothold in Choria-everything stems from her. A lot of those projects only worked with Walsh Group because of the tech she provided.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s fingers clenched around his glass.&#34;Travis, if you&#39;re just here to talk nonsense,then shut your mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Travis gave a slow shake of his head. &#34;You&#39;re too close to see it clearly. This whole mess?It&#39;s on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc shot up from his seat, anger flashing in his eyes. &#34;Oh, and now you&#39;re some moral high ground? Don&#39;t forget who you used to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>be, Travis-you were no better than the rest of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Travis sighed and rose to leave. &#34;Fine.I shouldn&#39;t have bothered. Enjoy your evening,Marc.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking back, he walked away,silently thinking how Marc had no clue how much he owed Stella and how ungrateful he had become.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s jaw tightened as he watched Travis walk out of the bar. After a long, tense pause,he leaned back slightly, lifted his glass, and swallowed the remaining liquor in one go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The alcohol hit fast, clouding his mind with a dull haze. The music thundered around him,but all he could see was Stella-over and over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep ache clenched in his chest, sharp and suffocating, as though some invisible force had wrapped around his heart and refused to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After she was thrown out of the car,Haley returned home. But she refused to give up.When he stopped answering her calls, she sent someone to track him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she heard he was drinking alone at a bar, she rushed there immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed open the heavy door, scanning the dim room until her eyes landed on Marc,slouched over the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurrying to his side, she looped her arm through his. &#34;Marc, what are you doing?You&#39;ve had too much-come on, let&#39;s get you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound of her voice, Marc sluggishly turned his head. His vision was hazy, but when he saw the figure beside him, his expression softened. He reached out, fingers brushing her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stel... you came back... don&#39;t leave me again... I love you, I always have...&#34; he murmured, his words slurred but heartfelt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley froze, as if someone had poured ice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>water down her spine. Her hands trembled.So all this-every drink, every silent minute-was for Stella?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While all that was happening, Stella and Steven had smoothly finalized their Cooperation agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wasting any time, Stella threw herself into work-organizing plans, going through the proposal from the planning team, and tweaking the key points before passing it on to William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William flipped through the folder with sharp,focused eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression didn&#39;t shift, but the moment he spotted the revisions, he knew exactly who had made them. Stella&#39;s touch was evident-subtle yet effective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,she wasn&#39;t just a pretty face with a story.She had real skill. No wonder Steven had taken an interest in her after only a couple of meetings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing the file, William raised his head and looked at her. His voice was steady but laced with something colder. &#34;Ms. Russell, now that you&#39;ve joined Briggs Group, I expect you to create real value. I suggest you stop wasting time on distractions-people or matters that are irrelevant. We don&#39;t keep dead weight here. If you&#39;re drawing a paycheck, make sure you earn it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella blinked, surprised by the sudden jab.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was that supposed to mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he hear about Marc showing up earlier?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he calling her out over that? Or maybe he just liked dragging up her past, treating it like some stain that wouldn&#39;t wash off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she had worked hard-going through every detail, staying up late to polish that proposal. How could he accuse her of not creating value?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart tightened, but she didn&#39;t let it show. Instead, she met his gaze with a calmer, colder tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Briggs, I&#39;m here to work, and I take my responsibilities seriously. But what I do in my personal life outside this office has nothing to do with you,&#34; she said steadily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t feel she owed anyone an apology.Everyone had a past. So did she. That didn&#39;t make her any less capable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her words made William&#39;s face turn slightly grim. So she was drawing a line now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she think he&#39;d just turn a blind eye if she flirted with Steven during working hours too?That wasn&#39;t something he was going to tolerate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella kept her posture firm. She stood tall,head held high, not backing down. After a deep breath, she added, &#34;If there&#39;s nothing else about the proposal, Mr. Briggs, I&#39;d like to get back to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned as if to leave, but William&#39;s voice came again, low and direct. &#34;Wait.&#34; She stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your revisions were well done,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Briggs Group isn&#39;t the same as the Walsh Group. You still have a lot to learn.I&#39;ll introduce you to someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella paused, then slowly turned back toward him. There was a slight frown on her brow, and her tone carried a hint of surprise.&#34;I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d hand out compliments so easily. Who exactly is this person you want me to meet?&#34;</p>
