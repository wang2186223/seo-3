                <p>Now wasn&#39;t the time to let emotions show. Marc quickly wiped the flicker of emotion from his face and kept moving through the crowd like he hadn&#39;t heard a thing. Whispers still lingered behind him, but he carried on, unbothered. At least, that&#39;s what it looked like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around them,guests exchanged knowing glances,but none dared say more out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley noticed the way people were looking at her-curious,speculative-but instead of shrinking under their judgment, she lifted her chin proudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So what if Marc was still married? She was the one on his arm tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And today? Today was the day Stella finally lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up on the second floor, Marc spotted Mr. Williams and made his way over. &#34;Mr. Williams, long time no see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr.Williams, a sharp investor known for backing only winners, turned with a gentlemanly smile and extended his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Walsh. It has been a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Mr. Williams&#39;s gaze shifted to Haley, eyes narrowing just slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in their circle knew about Marc&#39;s marriage to Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, Marc had crafted an image of a loyal husband-reserved,deeply devoted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So seeing another woman clinging to him tonight raised some unspoken questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But they were all adults here. No one would say it out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley, all confidence and charm, stepped forward.&#34;Mr. Williams, it&#39;s such a pleasure to finally meet you.I&#39;ve heard so much about your work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Williams gave her a polite nod, though his smile didn&#39;t quite reach his eyes. His attitude was civil-but cold. Haley felt it instantly, and for a second,her smile faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Marc could steer the conversation back,another guest swooped in to chat with Mr. Williams,cutting Marc off mid-sentence. Annoyance flashed in Marc&#39;s eyes, but he swallowed it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley tugged on his arm gently. &#34;Marc, let&#39;s go over there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was trying to sound casual, but inside, she was bursting with anticipation. According to the plan with Jazlyn, the photos should&#39;ve been released by now.Any minute now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley could already picture it-Stella&#39;s public humiliation, her mother showing up to see it all, and Marc finally realizing who deserved to stand beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she checked her phone... nothing. No photos. No message. No Jazlyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile tightened. What the hell was going on?Jazlyn had the whole day to send her the pictures.Why wasn&#39;t she sending them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plan had been airtight. Only she and Jazlyn knew about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe Jazlyn got cold feet?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, they had initially planned to fake it,but yesterday,Haley had taken it a step further. She had the men do it for real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that Jazlyn thought it was too much and deliberately withheld them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whipped out her phone and sent Jazlyn a direct message asking her to come over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would be easier to convince her in person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Jazlyn had been lounging at a private card table all afternoon, growing increasingly irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had waited since morning for the photos to arrive.Nothing. Even worse, the men they hired weren&#39;t responding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her usual perks-VIP salon appointments, luxury discounts-had mysteriously been revoked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d meant to call Haley, but a card game with the other socialites had distracted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, seeing Haley&#39;s message, she jumped to her feet.&#34;Oh, you ladies keep playing. I&#39;ve got to run-my son and daughter-in-law need me,&#34; she said smugly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other women exchanged amused glances.Daughter-in-law? Since when does she admit that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On her way to the event, Jazlyn tried to make sense of it all. Maybe Haley got the photos directly and was waiting for her to show up so they could reveal everything together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would be perfect. The thought thrilled her.</p>
