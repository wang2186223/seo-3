                <p>Stella stood calmly off to the side,her face unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to admit-Haley was slightly sharper than before, though not by much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella gave a light laugh. &#34;I&#39;m not your wife,so how could I have stolen your company secrets? As for the fake ID claim, why don&#39;t you show me your evidence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d moved on from Marc long ago. As far as she was concerned, as long as they didn&#39;t cross her path, she could act like they never existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, when her eyes met Marc&#39;s-full of determination-she couldn&#39;t help but feel how absurd it all was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc, of all people, knew her better than most, yet he was standing here, accusing her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>of stealing his company&#39;s technology?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had once hoped they could part peacefully. Clearly, Marc had no such intention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, we&#39;ve got proof,&#34; Haley snapped, her chin raised with confidence. &#34;That proposal you&#39;re holding is all the evidence we need.Do you dare show your files and let the data team compare them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella looked Haley straight in the eye. &#34;Why wouldn&#39;t I dare? But since you and Mr.Walsh are so eager to throw around accusations,how about this-if I prove | didn&#39;t take anything, you both owe me a public apology.And after that, stay the hell out of my life.Fair enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deal,&#34; Haley snapped back without hesitation. &#34;You should be nervous-using Marc&#39;s core tech to score this deal with SummitRise? You&#39;re nothing but a fraud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella didn&#39;t get angry. Instead, she laughed under her breath. &#34;Fine then. A deal&#39;s a deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just don&#39;t forget-whoever loses pays the price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then turned toward Steven with a calm,professional tone. &#34;Mr. Harrison, here&#39;s the tech l&#39;ve prepared for your company&#39;s project. You&#39;re welcome to have your analysts compare it with Walsh Group&#39;s system. I&#39;ll let the data do the talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven, the man in charge at SummitRise,had a skilled team behind him. Running IP checks and analyzing overlapping tech structures was standard procedure for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a brief nod and motioned to his assistant to begin the analysis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty minutes passed before the assistant quietly delivered the results to Steven&#39;s screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven read through the report, leaned back in his chair, and glanced at the group. &#34;There is an issue with Ms. Gilbert&#39;s proposal,&#34; he stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley immediately let out a smug laugh,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>turning to Stella with glee. &#34;What did I say?It&#39;s obvious you stole the Walsh Group&#39;s tech. There&#39;s no way you created something this advanced on your own in just six months.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc remained seated on the sofa, with one leg crossed over the other, silently watching Stella with an intense gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella,&#34; he said gently. &#34;I&#39;ll let this slide if you come home with me. We can act like none of this ever happened. I won&#39;t let the police get involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was tender, almost noble, like he was doing her a favor for a crime she hadn&#39;t even committed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before Stella could reply, Steven cleared his throat a few times, his expression shifting as his eyes darkened slightly. &#34;Actually, I&#39;m not done talking yet,&#34; he said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley and Marc turned to face him again,confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven leaned forward slightly and spoke</p>
                
                
                
                <p>with deliberate calm. &#34;What I said was that there&#39;s an issue with Ms. Gilbert&#39;s submission, but I never claimed it had any overlap with Walsh Group&#39;s data. The issue is that her design is too advanced. Entirely original. Not a single element from Walsh Group appears in her system. I&#39;m honestly...impressed. I was hoping to ask how she managed something so cutting-edge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revelation hit Marc and Haley like a thunderclap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stared at Steven in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t add up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t Stella developed this more advanced system by enhancing her own patent, which was once licensed to the Walsh Group as their core technology?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could her new system be entirely different?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! That&#39;s impossible!&#34; Haley shouted, her voice shrill. &#34;There has to be a mistake. She couldn&#39;t have developed something new on</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her own-she had to copy us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to accept that Stella might actually be that capable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do, Stella? Did you bribe Steven? You must&#39;ve used some dirty trick to get him on your side!&#34; Haley&#39;s voice dripped with accusation, trying to twist the situation now that her plan had fallen apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella let out a light chuckle. &#34;I&#39;m done wasting energy explaining myself. There&#39;s always someone better out there, maybe that&#39;s what you can&#39;t accept. What now, Ms.Smith? Too proud to say you were wrong? lf you can&#39;t bring yourself to apologize, I&#39;ll just take legal action for defamation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley clenched her jaw and glared daggers at Stella, her fury simmering just beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Steven&#39;s tone turned icy as he spoke again. &#34;Ms. Smith, what exactly are you suggesting? That SummitRise is rigging results? That we&#39;re conspiring against the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walsh Group? Ms. Gilbert won this deal fairly.You and Mr. Walsh, on the other hand,stormed in without invitation and created chaos. I&#39;d say it&#39;s your behavior that&#39;s out of line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words landed hard. For a moment, both Haley and Marc were too stunned to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the assistant, who had been silently waiting at the door, tapped gently and stepped in to ease the tension. &#34;Mr.Harrison, Mr. Sampson has arrived.&#34;</p>
