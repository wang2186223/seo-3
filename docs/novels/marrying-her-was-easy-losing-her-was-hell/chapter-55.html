                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the breaking point for Haley. Hearing those words sent her into a silent rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was convinced that no matter how messy things got for her, Stella would be dragged down too. She had stirred enough chaos to ruin Stella&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now? Now Stella was saying she wasn&#39;t even harmed that night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That couldn&#39;t be right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was seconds away from exploding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with everyone watching, she swallowed her anger, even though her face said otherwise-tight jaw, clenched fists, the works.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Marc-standing just a few steps away-let out a long, quiet breath. For him, the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>news came as a massive reliet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc loved Stella deeply. Even if something terrible had happened to her, he wouldn&#39;t have walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if she really had been violated, he knew he wouldn&#39;t be able to touch her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how much he cared for her, he couldn&#39;t ignore his obsession with purity. He wasn&#39;t the kind of man who could pretend nothing had changed if his wife had been with someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when he heard that Stella had only suffered minor injuries, it felt like a blessing from above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fear had been eating him up inside. Now that it turned out to be false, he promised himself he&#39;d hold onto her tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt overwhelmed with relief and moved toward Stella, wanting to tell her to be more careful. But just as he reached out, she slapped him hard across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t I tell you to stay away from me? You make me sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t the first slap today either. She&#39;d done it once already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone around them gasped in shock-no one expected her to go off on Marc like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella?&#34; Marc stood there, stunned. His cheek stung, but he didn&#39;t care-he just wanted to talk to her, to explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella,however,took a step back and didn&#39;t give him the chance. &#34;I&#39;m not done with you yet.That patent? It&#39;s been under a different company for a while now. Your people forced me into a deal I didn&#39;t wNant, and they kept using my work after the deal expired. That&#39;s illegal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she brought up the contract, Marc remembered the one Haley had handed him.His unease was written all over his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My new partners have already taken a hit because of your actions. Even if I wanted to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>spare you, they won&#39;t. So you&#39;d better be reaay for a huge payout.&#34; Her tone was icy. They were still technically married, but there wasn&#39;t a flicker of warmth in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s heart dropped. The contract worried him, sure-but what really scared him was how cold and done she looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley, sensing a chance to twist things,quickly jumped in. &#34;Oh, come on, Stella! Do you really think anyone&#39;s going to buy that story? Who would ever dare sue the Walsh Group? That patent&#39;s been under their name for years-everyone in the industry knows it. No one would even go near it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, all this talk was just Stella&#39;s way of pulling Marc back in. &#34;You&#39;re just trying to play the sympathy card so Marc won&#39;t divorce you.You think that&#39;s gonna work? What do you even have to offer? I can bring him real deals-foreign investors, key partnerships. You&#39;ve got nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley never saw herself as second best to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella. Not for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only distinction lay in having met Marc at a later juncture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet in matters of affection, did precedence hold any relevance?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one who wasn&#39;t loved was the real outsider!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What have you even done besides that one lucky patent? If Marc hadn&#39;t backed you up,you&#39;d have been out on the streets a long time ago. That patent? He only used it because he felt sorry for you. Do you seriously think you&#39;re some brilliant inventor?&#34;</p>
