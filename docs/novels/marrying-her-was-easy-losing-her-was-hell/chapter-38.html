                <p>Stella had been waiting for a chance to draw a clean line with her former mother-in-law and to let Jazlyn know she intended to reclaim everything that rightfully belonged to her-possessions Jazlyn would soon have to relinquish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the silence stretched, Jazlyn&#39;s sharp voice continued grating through the phone. &#34;Are you deaf?Didn&#39;t you hear a word I said? Is this how you treat your elders? No wonder you lost my son!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The barrage of accusations yanked Stella out of her thoughts, flooding her with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During her marriage, she&#39;d endured Jazlyn&#39;s endless nitpicking with practiced patience, never once losing her composure, even before learning the truth about Marc and Haley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But years of civility had gotten her nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Jazlyn had only grown more arrogant, using every chance to belittle her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,with everything unraveling, Stella saw no point in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>pretending any longer. Someone as petty as Jazlyn deserved to be put in her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; Stella replied, her tone cool and unbothered.&#34;I&#39;ll be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn&#39;s mouth was already open, ready to launch another tirade, when Stella&#39;s sudden agreement caught her off guard. For a split second, Jazlyn faltered, blinking in surprise, but she quickly recovered her domineering air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;d better show up,&#34; she snapped. &#34;You have half an hour. If you&#39;re late, I&#39;ll make Marc divorce you on the spot-and don&#39;t expect to see a single cent from the settlement!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The threat almost made Stella laugh out loud. As if she had any interest in Marc&#39;s pitiful fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the one chasing after her now, desperate to buy back the patent she owned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the call ended, Stella flagged down a taxi and headed straight for the Voyage Hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, it didn&#39;t take her long to spot Haley and Jazlyn together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They sat side by side, putting on a show of solidarity and warmth, like two actresses playing the role of a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>loving family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn&#39;s eyes flashed the moment she saw Stella walk in. Without hesitation, she slammed her palm onto the table, sending a jolt through the cutlery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,you finally bothered to show up. I want you to divorce my son, right here, right now. Tell me, after all these years of marriage, what have you ever done for the Walsh family? You can&#39;t even give us a child.Absolutely useless. No place in this family for a barren hen like you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words stung, each one meant to cut deeper than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Stella barely flinched. She&#39;d lost count of how many times Jazlyn had spat out the same vicious remarks over the years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley lounged next to Jazlyn, an unmistakable look of satisfaction playing at the corners of her mouth. &#34;Her family&#39;s nothing-lost her parents young, raised without manners. You really shouldn&#39;t lower yourself,Jazlyn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn, emboldened by Haley&#39;s support, banged her fist against the table. &#34;Get those divorce papers ready by Monday. I refuse to tolerate you in my family for one more day!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Haley had worked her influence, Jazlyn truly believed she deserved a daughter-in-law like Haley -someone polished and pedigreed, not a nobody like Stella getting in Marc&#39;s way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley braced herself,half-expecting a fight,but Stella merely nodded, calm and unflinching. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll divorce him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The answer blindsided both of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes locked, equally shocked by Stella&#39;s ready surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the chill in Stella&#39;s smile, Haley stayed composed, clasped Jazlyn&#39;s hand, and pressed. &#34;Stella,what do you want out of this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sidelong glance, Stella&#39;s gaze lingered on Haley, recognizing a glimmer of shrewdness absent in Jazlyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not making any demands. Divorce is perfectly fine by me. But, Jazlyn, I expect you to pay back every cent I spent on your endless beauty appointments and imported supplements. And as for the casino? I hope you enjoyed your last visit,because you won&#39;t be stepping foot in there again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn had clawed her way through a harsh youth,and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>once Marc&#39;s fortunes soared, she wasted no time plunging into a life of extravagance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reveled in every indulgence-her weeks filled with pampering sessions at upscale salons and rare imported supplements lined up on her vanity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also had a taste for gambling, though she was hardly discreet about it. Bad luck dogged her at every turn, and when her losses piled up, so did her foul temper-her sharp tongue echoing through the casino until someone dragged her away. If not for Stella&#39;s discreet intervention, the casino staff would have barred her years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, hearing Stella&#39;s cool demands, Jazlyn&#39;s face twisted with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw straight through the act-Stella was stalling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, she had no real intention of letting go and dared to bargain as if she still held any cards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, don&#39;t you dare get greedy with me. Why should I pay you back a cent?&#34; Jazlyn snapped, her voice dripping with indignation. &#34;Those supplements?My son paid for them. As for the salon visits, I cover those with my own membership.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley interjected, her tone sharp and mocking, &#34;Stella,honestly, isn&#39;t this a little beneath you? Or could it be</p>
                
                
                
                <p>you&#39;re not actually ready for this divorce-and you&#39;re just making excuses to keep Jazlyn on a leash?&#34;</p>
