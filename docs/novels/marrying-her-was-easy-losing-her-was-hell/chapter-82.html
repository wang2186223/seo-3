                <p>Even Haley stood frozen, her smile faltering as she stared at the woman beside Steven Harrison. That face. That posture. That aura.It can&#39;t be... Stella? But that was impossible.She was supposed to be dead. There had even been an official death certificate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet here she was-alive, glowing, and even more striking than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s hands tightened involuntarily around her clutch. No... it&#39;s not her. It can&#39;t be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Stella&#39;s arm was gripped hard-Marc, his voice trembling, looked as if he&#39;d just seen a ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Stella quickly yanked her arm away, her expression turning icy. &#34;Sir, I don&#39;t know you.You&#39;ve mistaken me for someone else. I&#39;m here to discuss business with Mr. Harrison.&#34;Her tone was sharp, clipped and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc panicked. &#34;Stella, enough. Don&#39;t do this. Do you have any idea how long l&#39;ve been searching for you? I turned the whole damn country upside down! I know | was wrong-I swear I&#39;ll make it right this time.Come home with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought-maybe hoped-that he could still pull her back. He didn&#39;t sign the divorce papers-she was still his wife. &#34;You are Stella. I&#39;m sure of it. You&#39;re my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella almost laughed. After all this time-six whole months-Marc hadn&#39;t changed a bit.Still trying to charm his way through everything with that same self-righteous attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a soft, mocking chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your wife? Wow. That&#39;s cute. Sir, if this is your idea of flirting, you&#39;re seriously off the mark. And for the record, I prefer gentlemen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned toward Steven with an apologetic look. &#34;Sorry about this, Mr.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harrison. I&#39;ll stop by your office another time to continue our conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, she was under William&#39;s protection.Steven wouldn&#39;t dare let anything happen to her-not in his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven gave a slight nod, clearly about to respond when Marc suddenly reached out again and grabbed her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not possible,&#34; he said, voice hoarse with desperation. &#34;You are Stella.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice broke as the scene around them slowed-guests now fully focused on the growing commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s patience snapped. Smack! The sound of the slap cracked through the air,silencing the room. Her eyes were like frost as she looked down at him. &#34;You&#39;re being extremely rude, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached into her clutch, pulled out her ID,and held it up for him to see. &#34;My name is Sylvia Gilbert. I don&#39;t know any Stella. And as for your wife...&#34; She tilted her head, her smile</p>
                
                
                
                <p>cool. &#34;Maybe get help for those delusions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s cheek stung, but he couldn&#39;t care less at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gaze was locked on the ID in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just the name-it was the birth date,the address, the background. Everything was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet... her face was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could this not be Stella?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he stood there, stunned, she casually slid the card back into her bag and added lightly,&#34;If this was some desperate tactic to get my attention, sir, I&#39;d advise you to try a little harder-and a lot less creepily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc, dazed, shook his head. &#34;No... no, if you&#39;re not Stella, then why are you even here? You knew I&#39;d be at this banquet, didn&#39;t you? You came for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella laughed, amused by his shallow reasoning. &#34;Sir, what gives you such extraordinary confidence for someone so...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ordinary? I&#39;m here to discuss business with Mr. Harrison. What does that have to do with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s face darkened. Business? With Steven? He stood there, momentarily stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pursed his lips slightly, his expression a mix of confusion and something else. &#34;Stella,whatever this is, you&#39;re pushing it now. Let&#39;s deal our personal matters privately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless, he had to secure the SummitRise Group&#39;s project. Once he did, he wouldn&#39;t be under Haley&#39;s thumb anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Steven. &#34;Mr. Harrison, I apologize for the earlier scene. Walsh Group is fully capable of managing the new energy project, and I hope you&#39;ll give us fair consideration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven had been silently observing the entire exchange, expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now he smiled faintly. &#34;Of course, Mr. Walsh.Fair competition is the only way to do</p>
                
                
                
                <p>business. But you should know-Nebula Group has offered quite a compelling proposal. They&#39;ve guaranteed the plan will pass on the first round, no revisions needed.And if it doesn&#39;t, they&#39;re prepared to offer immediate financial compensation. Can Walsh Group offer the same?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s jaw slackened. No revisions?Immediate compensation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to look at Stella. WVas she out of her mind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was she so confident their plan would pass on the first try?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The risk alone was astronomical-eight-figure losses at minimum if the proposal failed.And she agreed to that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, Steven had just said Stella could provide the latest technology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her previous patent had already made waves -it was cutting-edge at the time. So what could she possibly have come up with now that was even better?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt a dull ache creeping into his temples.What the hell had she been up to during the six months she vanished?</p>
