                <p>After collecting her things, Stella said goodbye to Lainey, mentioning she had to head out early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey gave her a casual nod. &#34;Go on ahead. There&#39;s nothing urgent here today anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Stella reached Marc&#39;s company, Haley&#39;s sharp,entitled voice was already echoing from inside the legal department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to step in, Evie-a familiar face from the past-hurried over and tugged Stella aside.&#34;Mrs. Walsh, what are you doing here? That Haley girl is clearly targeting you. You really shouldn&#39;t go in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew how much losing the patent would hurt the company, but Haley&#39;s arrogance had rubbed them all the wrong way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And on top of that, they all knew Stella was Marc&#39;s legal wife, and Haley was nothing more than a mistress, yet she strutted around like she owned the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not sure what she&#39;d walked into, Stella raised a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evie pulled a face. &#34;What do you think? First day here and she&#39;s already scolding the whole legal team,calling them useless for not landing the deal. Mrs.Walsh,seriously-better not walk in there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella gave her a calm smile, silently letting her know it was alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she walked in, Haley glanced up and spotted her.Reclining on the sofa with her chin lifted high, she wore the smug look of a cat that had just lapped up a bowl of cream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, look who finally decided to show up,&#34; Haley sneered. &#34;You were all high and mighty yesterday,acting like you didn&#39;t need the contract. And now?You&#39;re back to sign it like nothing happened. If this was where you&#39;d end up anyway, what was all that drama for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s eyes were filled with contempt. To her, Stella was nothing in comparison. She was the dignified daughter of the prestigious Smith family from Achury.What did Stella have? Just Marc as a husband-and even that, she believed, was temporary. In her mind,Marc&#39;s affections had already shifted. Stella had no right to challenge her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella stood in the legal department&#39;s office, listening in silence as Haley rambled on and on. She didn&#39;t bother replying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression was calm, almost indifferent, like none of it mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually,when Haley realized she was the only one speaking, her smug look disappeared. Her face darkened with frustration, and she snapped, &#34;What the hell are you pretending for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella finally looked her way and let out a quiet chuckle. &#34;If Marc hadn&#39;t dragged innocent people into this, I wouldn&#39;t be here. So, this is your talent?Manipulating people who have nothing to do with your feud? Impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s face turned red with rage. Stella had hit a nerve. It had been Haley&#39;s idea to pressure Stella into showing up by having Marc involve the legal department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, all&#39;s fair in love and war! If it works, then it works.Now sign the damn contract-right now!&#34;Haley barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Stella just smiled faintly, unbothered. &#34;No. I&#39;m not signing anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the argument could spiral further, Theo Haynes, the vice head of legal, let out a silent sigh. His temples were already starting to throb. He stepped in quickly, trying to defuse the growing tension. &#34;Mrs.Walsh, if something&#39;s bothering you, let&#39;s talk it through. You are Mr. Walsh&#39;s wife,after all. Just let us know what you need, and we&#39;ll work something out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella shifted her eyes back to Haley and gave a small smile,calm but cutting. &#34;The reason I&#39;m not renewing the contract? Simple. It&#39;s her. If you want my signature,tell your Mr. Walsh to show me some sincerity. And by that, I mean start by kicking Haley out of the company,and make sure she leaves humiliated.&#34;</p>
