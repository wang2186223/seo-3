                <p>When Stella glanced up, she found Marc standing in the door, dressed sharply in his usual suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated,momentarily thrown-he was home far earlier than she expected. Marc never left work this soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The timing couldn&#39;t have been worse,but Stella kept her calm, moving past him with her things cradled in her arms, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She banked on the hope that he&#39;d be too distracted to pay her any mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc didn&#39;t even glance at what she was holding-he strode right over and caught her wrist without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, I was planning to pick you up at the research institute today. I waited outside for ages, but you never showed. Did you leave by another exit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She coldly met his gaze, gently pulling her wrist free.&#34;I got a lift home with a colleague.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc fell silent, caught off guard by her answer. A colleague?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had that man really been her colleague?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc scanned her face, hunting for the slightest flicker of guilt, but she gave him nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single tremor, not a quiver-she held herself with the composure of untouched water, completely inscrutable. However hard he stared, there wasn&#39;t a trace of dishonesty to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft laugh, Marc strode over and slipped an arm around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve put in so much effort, Stella. Now that things at the company are settled, I finally have a free week.What do you say we use this time to try for a baby?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown pinched Stella&#39;s brow. Try for a baby? Was he serious?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could&#39;ve sworn she&#39;d spelled it out for him last time, but Marc clearly hadn&#39;t let go of his obsession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes iced over, voice sharp and distant. &#34;Marc,I&#39;ve already told you-l don&#39;t want a baby right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just four more days and she&#39;d be free of this manipulative man forever. The idea of starting a family with him felt laughable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>think it&#39;d be wonderful to have a baby? You always talked about wanting one before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That word-before-made something flicker in Stella&#39;s eyes,her mouth curving into a cold half-smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dropped the things she&#39;d been carrying without a second thought, lifted her gaze, and fired off a question with cutting ease. &#34;Marc, how are those condoms from Raskait working out for you? Bet they didn&#39;t disappoint.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella didn&#39;t hesitate to drag his secret into the light,bluntly naming the night he&#39;d slunk away to meet Haley behind her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s entire body went rigid. For a moment, he just stared at her, stunned silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d honestly believed she hadn&#39;t suspected a thing -until now, when he realized she&#39;d known every detail and simply chosen not to say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, wait-just let me explain...&#34; Marc&#39;s voice trembled with desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no patience left for any more excuses.Without looking back, Stella marched into the study,slammed the door behind her, and twisted the lock with a sharp click.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc pressed his fingers to his temples, groaning in exasperation,then stomped down the stairs and made his way into the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He yanked open the cabinet and reached for the gas stove,flicking it on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever Stella shut him out, he&#39;d head to the kitchen and whip up her favorite dishes-food had always been his go-to peace offering, and usually,she softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But tonight, he sensed it would take more than a home-cooked meal to win her over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While getting the meal ready, his gaze darted around,and he realized the house felt strangely emptier than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t spent much time here lately, but he distinctly recalled Stella&#39;s prized capsule coffee maker always sitting on the counter. Now, a bare patch marked where it had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knot formed in Marc&#39;s brow. He set the knife down and abandoned the half-prepared meal, taking the steps in a hurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, what happened to the capsule coffee maker?The one that was always in the kitchen?&#34;</p>
