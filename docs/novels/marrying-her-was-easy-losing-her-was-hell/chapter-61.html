                <p>Stella stared out the window, quietly turning his words over in her mind. She&#39;d been lost in thought for a while, and just as she was about to speak, the car rolled to a gentle stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced over at him, only to hear him say calmly, &#34;We&#39;ve arrived at the research institute&#39;s dormitory, Ms. Russell. Please take care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way he said it-polite and distant-left her with no room to ask anything further. Stella had no choice but to hold back the question on the tip of her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear he was politely drawing the line, and pressing him now would only come off as rude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she simply lowered her head, whispered a soft thank you, and stepped out of the car without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she returned to the dorm, Lainey was still</p>
                
                
                
                <p>awake. The moment she heard the door, she sat up, her eyes full of worry. &#34;Hey, how did it go?Everything alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella could tell Lainey had been worried.&#34;It went well,&#34; she said. &#34;And honestly, if you hadn&#39;t fixed my recorder, I couldn&#39;t have shown everyone that Haley framed me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley and Marc were probably having a rough time at the police station right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if they managed to walk out later, their reputations were already in shambles. Once she filed for divorce, the truth behind it would be out in the open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the patent, Marc could forget about it.That ship had sailed, and his troubles were only just getting started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey waved her hand like it was no big deal.&#34;Please, those two snakes deserve everything coming to them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, Lainey thought this was letting them off</p>
                
                
                
                <p>easy. If she had her way, they&#39;d be skinned alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella chuckled at how fired up Lainey was. As she changed clothes, she asked casually, &#34;Hey,why didn&#39;t you tell me that Mr. Briggs was the one behind the company I signed with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey blinked. &#34;Wait, what are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella gave her a look. &#34;The company that offered me the new contract-it&#39;s under the Briggs Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey gawked at her, totally floored-just as stunned as Stella had been when she found out earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella had assumed Lainey was already aware,but it was obvious now that she had no clue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god! William? You&#39;re working with him?|seriously had no idea!&#34; Lainey gasped. &#34;I only knew the rep seemed generous and professional over the phone. They felt legit, so l</p>
                
                
                
                <p>told you to go for it. I didn&#39;t know he was behind the whole thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She truly hadn&#39;t realized it was linked to William.If she had, she might&#39;ve thought twice and definitely would&#39;ve given Stella a heads-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella didn&#39;t actually mind-it just felt a little awkward. But since Lainey clearly hadn&#39;t known, Stella waved it off and said it didn&#39;t matter. As long as the partnership worked out,that was all that mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey agreed quickly. &#34;Honestly, they&#39;re offering a much better deal. This will be way more worthwhile than anything Marc ever gave you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to business, Lainey felt she could count on William to be fair and professional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the way,&#34; Lainey began, &#34;you&#39;re all over the internet right now. After what happened at the gala, everyone&#39;s talking about how Marc stole your patent. Looks like Briggs Group is getting</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ready to take legal action, and the compensation alone might bankrupt him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s company had only grown because of Stella&#39;s invention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when the news broke that the patent was no longer his to use, his business partners didn&#39;t waste a second-they pulled out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier today, Marc had been trying to line up new investors. But after the scandal, no one in Choria wanted anything to do with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Covering the compensation fees now would be nearly impossible for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this rate, he&#39;d have no choice but to mortgage the company, maybe even lose it entirely. That would be the end of the Walsh Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella hadn&#39;t heard something this satisfying in a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Lainey wasn&#39;t done yet. &#34;As for Haley-she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>thought she could get away with anything just because she&#39;s not from around here. But the authorities aren&#39;t letting it slide. She&#39;s probably headed to jail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With two nations involved, the whole thing had become a diplomatic issue, not something that could be brushed under the rug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting Haley off the hook just like that would damage the government&#39;s credibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if it was only for show, they couldn&#39;t afford to go easy on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Stella stepped out of the shower,feeling clean and much more at ease. The steady chirping of cicadas outside created the kind of calm that made sleep come easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She curled up in bed, tugged the blanket over her, and shut her eyes with a quiet sense of peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chaos and hurt she&#39;d been through finally ended today. She had taken her stand-and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Stella and Lainey slept peacefully, Marc was having a far rougher night.</p>
