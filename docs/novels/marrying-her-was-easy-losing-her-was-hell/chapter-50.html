                <p>Just minutes ago, the crowd had been whispering behind Marc&#39;s back, yet the moment Haley cast the baseless accusations at Stella,their judgment shifted to Stella without hesitation. It was laughable how quickly they flipped, loyal to no one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella didn&#39;t spare their words a second thought. After all, none of them actually knew her. If they could insult her today because of Haley, they could just as easily switch sides tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,it wasn&#39;t worth her time to argue with such fickle minds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She threw a glance at Marc. His face was tight with hesitation, torn between sides, and Stella couldn&#39;t help but find the whole thing rather</p>
                
                
                
                <p>amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she shifted her attention to Haley,who looked far too pleased with herself. Stella&#39;s voice was calm but clear. &#34;You&#39;re accusing me of sleeping around-do you have proof?Because if not, then what you&#39;re doing is slander. And I can take you to court for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella steppoed closer, staring at Haley. &#34;You speak with such detail-about the toys, the outfits. Were you hiding there in the room? Or maybe, just maybe, you were the one who set all this up from the beginning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella had seen Haley at the hotel with her own eyes, so she was certain this had all been planned by Haley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wNay she spoke now didn&#39;t even sound like a question-it was more like a fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley stiffened. She knew what she&#39;d done,but with Marc and the people watching, admitting it was out of the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly shook her head, fumbling for words.&#34;W-Well, someone saw it and told me. Stella,haven&#39;t you heard the saying? The truth always comes out. You should really think about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to regain her confidence, Haley stepped closer and raised her chin, forcing herself to look bold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the more she puffed herself up, the more obvious it became-she was guilty and scrambling to cover it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella let out a quiet laugh. &#34;Alright then.If you&#39;re so confident, show us the evidence.What toys? Which men? Let&#39;s see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella had learned this long ago-she didn&#39;t owe anyone an explanation, least of all people like them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Haley really believed what she was saying,then she should prove it. Otherwise, it was nothing more than hot air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley shot a desperate look at Jazlyn, who only</p>
                
                
                
                <p>frowned back, clearly just as lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing frantic, she urged, &#34;Jazlyn!&#34;-clearly signaling her to come up with something,anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to her shock, Jazlyn flinched and blurted out, &#34;Haley, show them the proof already! Didn&#39;t you say you saw everything yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley stood there stunned. What? Wasn&#39;t Jazlyn supposed to have the photos?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As it turned out, both had assumed the other had the proof. Now, their entire setup crumbled before everyone&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella watched their confusion play out like a poorly written script. She couldn&#39;t help but laugh lightly. &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Can&#39;t find it now?Want me to give you a hand? Maybe I should start laying out the details... like when you and Marc started your little affair and what you two have been doing behind closed doors. Do you want me to spell it out for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t bluffing. She always came prepared for moments like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, Marc and Haley had been so careless, she didn&#39;t even need concrete proof-their actions spoke for themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As murmurs rippled through the room,people turned their eyes back to Marc and Haley, now standing awkwardly under the weight of public scrutiny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the air was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s breath hitched as he met Stella&#39;s unwavering gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For thefirst time, it hit him-she had known all along. Known about everything. And still, she hadn&#39;t said a word until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice trembled as he stepped forward.&#34;Stella,wait-please,let me explain-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Stella didn&#39;t flinch. As Marc moved toward her, she calmly raised the wine glass in her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hand, and in the next second, splashed the entire drink straight into his face.</p>
