                <p>&#34;Unbelievable. He actually dares to call you? Don&#39;t answer, Stella-it&#39;ll only make you feel worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella silently agreed. Lainey had a point. She wasn&#39;t planning on answering in the first place, so she calmly hit the reject button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But barely a few seconds passed before the phone lit up again,buzzing with the same name-relentless,like he couldn&#39;t take a hint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s patience snapped. As the phone buzzed again,she slammed her finger on the answer button before Stella could stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you keep calling her? You&#39;re her husband,yet you&#39;re out there messing around with someone else, and now you raise your hand at her too? Just stop. She doesn&#39;t want to hear your voice ever again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc was caught off guard-he hadn&#39;t expected anyone else to pick up her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Lainey&#39;s words, his expression darkened. So Stella had told her? He wasn&#39;t thrilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was between husband and wife-what business did others have meddling?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is between me and Stella. I called her. I don&#39;t see how it involves you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey bristled, her voice sharp with fury. &#34;How is it not my business? I&#39;m her friend-her real friend.If something affects her, it is my business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s tone dropped, sharp and icy. &#34;You must be incredibly free if you&#39;ve got time to stick your nose where it doesn&#39;t belong. But if you want to meddle,fine by me-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone was still on speaker, and every word Marc said echoed in the room, clear for Stella to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew that tone all too well. When Marc started talking like this, calm but cutting, it meant he was angry,trying to intimidate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting Lainey to be dragged into this any further,Stella quietly reached for the phone and took it from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried a hint of coldness. &#34;Marc, she&#39;s my friend. The least you can do is show her some respect.You&#39;re the one cheating and still trying to have it all.I&#39;m not answering because just hearing your voice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>disgusts me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was rare for her to speak to Marc with such open contempt. But today, she couldn&#39;t hold it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s tone shifted immediately, his voice softening.&#34;Stella, I know I messed up. I&#39;m really sorry. Please don&#39;t be angry anymore. Let&#39;s talk calmly when you get home,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You honestly make me sick,&#34; Stella snapped. &#34;You want both sides,both women-do you even hear how pathetic that sounds?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no point in pretending anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she felt now wasn&#39;t just anger-it was a gut-deep disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc paused, then spoke again in a lower and more deliberatevoice. &#34;Stella, I&#39;ll wait for you at home. Just give me one chance to explain; that&#39;s all I&#39;m asking.You wouldn&#39;t want me showing up at your institute,right? If your coworkers and boss see me, that won&#39;t be good for you. So please... just do the smart thing.Come home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s chest tightened. That same suffocating grip of Marc&#39;s control wrapped around her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t an empty threat-she knew him too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he decided to show up at the institute, he wouldn&#39;t just cause a stir-he&#39;d dig until he found something,and that would ruin everything she had quietly planned for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, she forced herself to breathe,swallowed the fire risingin her throat, and softened her voice. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll go back after I finish up here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Marc&#39;s voice relaxed instantly,even carrying a hint of satisfaction. &#34;That&#39;s my girl. It&#39;s been a while since we had a nice dinner together.I&#39;ll wait for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the call ended, Stella felt her whole body go rigid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand,still wrapped around the phone, had turned pale from how tightly she was holding it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey looked at Stella with concern. &#34;Stella... what if he hits you again when you go back? Let me come with you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could finish, Stella met her gaze and gave a small, reassuring smile. &#34;He won&#39;t. Trust me, he wouldn&#39;t dare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey didn&#39;t look convinced. Her eyes searched Stella&#39;s face for any sign of doubt, but after a long moment, she gave in with a reluctant nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, after wrapping things up at the institute, Stella returned to the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she stepped inside, Marc was already waiting for her on the living room sofa. He&#39;d changed into relaxed clothes and looked calm, as if the events of earlier had never happened. The moment he saw her, he stood and reached for her hand with easy familiarity.&#34;I had the chef make all your favorites tonight. Come on,let&#39;s eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella forced down the queasy feeling swirling in her stomach, took her seat in silence, and barely touched her food. She kept her head down,saying almost nothing the entire meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, back in the bedroom, she stood in front of the mirror, staring at her reflection-at the exhaustion behind her eyes, at the woman she barely recognized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Marc stepped outof the bathroom and slowly walked over. He leaned forward, trying to kiss her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as if on instinct, Stella shifted away, putting space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze for a second, a flicker of impatience tightening his jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he kept his tone even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, about what happened earlier.. I didn&#39;t mean for it to blow up like that. You know how things are,right? Haley&#39;s family has deep ties to our company.I can&#39;t afford to upset them. But I get it, I went too far with you.&#34; He let out a sigh and continued, &#34;That&#39;s why I&#39;m giving you full admin access to the security system.You&#39;ll be able to check any footage, any time you want. This company is yours too. You&#39;re practically half the boss here. So... don&#39;t stay mad at me,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was trying-pretending, perhaps-to make peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her unresponsive, he reached for her hand and gently rubbed his thumb along her fingers. &#34;I promise,this won&#39;t happen again. Today was the last time.Just trust me,please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Stella pulled her hand back, her voice low and laced with irony. &#34;Half the boss, huh? Is that your way of saying you&#39;ll keep using my patent without paying a cent?&#34;</p>
