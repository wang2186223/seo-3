                <p>Incredible</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley froze,eyes wide with disbelief. &#34;Wait...What did you just say?&#34; Had she misunderstood him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s mouth curved into a familiar smile, but there was no softness in his eyes. &#34;Stella is my wife-and always will be. I&#39;ve said it before, what&#39;s between us is nothing more than a fling. Isn&#39;t this kind of thing considered normal where you&#39;re from? You didn&#39;t really think it meant something... did you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, the position of a wife belonged solely to Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Haley? She was someone to enjoy in passing.Nothing more,nothing less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc didn&#39;t mind keeping her close, so long as she knew her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Haley just stared at him, tryingto process what he&#39;d said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was that supposed to mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s recent attention made her believe he was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>starting to fall for her. Now he was claiming she&#39;d mistaken everything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did that worthless woman really mean more to him than she did?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley stiffened, her smile fading. &#34;Marc, what are you even talking about right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly what it sounds like. If you don&#39;t like how things are, you&#39;re free to walk away.&#34; A shadow flickered in Marc&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t risk offending the Smith family. But no matter the cost, he&#39;d never replace Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley felt a sharp sting in her chest watching the finality in his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t joking after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she wasn&#39;t someone who quit easily. If she wanted something, she chased it until it was hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc only clung to Stella because they hadn&#39;t spent real time together yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But once they did, he&#39;d see that he belonged with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought anchoring her, Haley straightened herself and forced a light laugh. &#34;Come on, I was just</p>
                
                
                
                <p>messing around. I got carried away-don&#39;t be mad.For you, I&#39;ll let it slide. I won&#39;t pick on her anymore.But... you owe me for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc watched her, his expression impossible to read.&#34;Fine. Whatever you ask for, I&#39;ll grant it. Just keep your promise-leave Stella alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving Marc&#39;s office, Stella didn&#39;t head back to the research institute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With only five days left until the project kicked off,she had to get everything in order before then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella returned to the villa and dropped onto the couch,massaging her weary eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone began to ring. Without checking the screen,she hit the answer button and held it to her ear. &#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, there&#39;s a party tonight. I managed to snag an invite. You should get dressed and come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella blinked slowly, not quite keeping up. &#34;Lainey, I&#39;m really wiped out. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve got the energy for a party tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;William&#39;s attending,&#34; Lainey added casually. &#34;It&#39;s his friend&#39;s event. Weren&#39;t you hoping for a chance to talk to him in private?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That snapped her out of her haze. Stella bolted upright. &#34;Wait-William&#39;s going to be there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yep! And since I&#39;m on the guest list, I can bring you.A relaxed setting like that is perfect for getting closer to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey had clearly misunderstood her intentions again,but Stella didn&#39;t bother correcting her this time.&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll be there. Just send me the details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the call ended, Stella raced upstairs to get ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she came back down, her phone buzzed with a new message. Expecting it to be from Lainey,she tapped on it, only to realize it was from Haley instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella scowled as she stared at the one-minute voice note. Her thumb hesitated in mid-air before finally pressing play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost immediately, a sultry voice spilled from the speaker, sending a chill down her spine.&#34;Oh, Marc,you&#39;re incredible... God...&#34;</p>
