                <p>Another Plan</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella couldn&#39;t remember how she made it back to her desk. The low drone in her ears swallowed every other sound, blurring the world around her like she&#39;d slipped underwater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey,hovering nearby, took in Stella&#39;s vacant stare and recognized the bruised look of disappointment.Without a word, she placed a comforting hand on Stella&#39;s shoulder and rubbed her back in slow,gentle circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, it&#39;s all right,&#34; she murmured, her tone soothing but tinged with concern. &#34;There&#39;ll be more research projects coming up soon. Missing out on this one isn&#39;t the end of the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s worried voice finally pierced the fog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella blinked, the office lights suddenly too bright,and managed a crooked, defeated smile. &#34;I&#39;m fine,really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure?&#34; Lainey&#39;s brow furrowed, unconvinced.&#34;You don&#39;t look fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella inhaled shakily, steadying herself with a few deep breaths. &#34;Honestly, I&#39;m okay. Don&#39;t fuss over me,Lainey. Go take care of your own work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Lainey a nudge, forcing her away with a small, grateful glance, then slumped into her chair,numb and silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d pinned so much hope on this project-believing it would finally cut the last thread tying her to Marc.But after everything,maybe those misunderstandings had sealed her fate from the start. William had never intended to put her on the team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, staring at her blank screen, a heavier question pressed in. How was she supposed to deal with the looming divorce?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella massaged her aching temples, pushing herself to come up with a new plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The divorce agreement-her so-called &#34;gift&#34; to Marc -had been handed over long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she couldn&#39;t join the project team, so be it. Maybe this was her cue to step back and disappear for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, the marriage was already finished;nothing about the project would change that fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that realization, some of the pressure in her chest finally loosened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reminded herself, over and over,that problems always had a workaround, no matter how bleak things looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching her cup, Stella wandered toward the break room. She nearly collided with Luca, who&#39;d dropped by the institute for work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One glance at her expression and he immediately pieced it together-she&#39;d seen the team roster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Russell,&#34; Luca called out, concern flickering in his eyes. &#34;Try not to let the list get to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella caught on belatedly-Luca was trying, in his awkward way, to cheer her up. The attempt struck her as almost endearing. A hint of a smirk played on her lips. &#34;Luca, you really have no talent for comforting people,you know that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked flustered, searching for a comeback and coming up empty. After a brief silence, he shifted gears. &#34;Mr. Briggs is hosting a dinner at the Voyage Hotel tonight. If you&#39;re not busy, Ms. Russell, maybe you should come along. It might give him a chance to reconsider.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s eyes flickered with surprise at his odd invitation. She found it strange-Luca, of all people,was supposed to know every detail of William&#39;s plans,maybe even help shape them behind the scenes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If William had truly made up his mind to exclude her,what was the point in showing up and begging for a spot?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone else might&#39;ve offered that advice, but coming from Luca,it rang hollow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set her jaw, her expression resolute. &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary. Mr. Briggs must have his reasons. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s found someone better suited for the team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, Stella turned and walked off,her cup in hand, heading for the break room and leaving Luca standing in the hallway,looking slightly defeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was trapped-caught between loyalty to William and his belief in Stella&#39;s talent, knowing that losing her would be the team&#39;s loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While refilling her cup, Stella mustered a brittle,practiced smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that William had made his choice, she saw no reason to linger in his orbit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their connection had always revolved around the project, and with that door closed, she felt no urge to chase after a man so clearly indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no use clinging to someone who barely acknowledged her existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at her desk, the finalized team list gave her an unfamiliar stretch of free time. Stella propped her phone against her notebook, thumbing through flight options out of Choria. Each new city she scrolled past felt like a lifeline tossed into deep water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc would discover the divorce agreement sooner or later, and knowing him, he&#39;d move heaven and earth to hunt her down. If she stayed in Choria, escape would be impossible-Marc&#39;s persistence was as relentless as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the world outside Choria was wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s attention was tangled up with Haley now, and he wouldn&#39;t waste much effort tracking her if she vanished completely from his radar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The farther she fled, the safer she&#39;d be!</p>
