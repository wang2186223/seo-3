                <p>One-Night Stand</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s final words hit harder than any slap. The way she called him &#34;husband&#34; carried weight.It wasn&#39;t just to remind him of their relationship but more like a warning. As if she really might walk out and find someone else... just like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s hand clamped tighter around her wrist,his voice low and livid. &#34;Don&#39;t you dare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip was so tight it felt like he might snap a bone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was nothing compared to the ache in her chest. Stella felt as if something had pierced right through her heart, each heartbeat twisting the knife deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met his eyes, pain and disbelief swimming in hers. &#34;So you do know you&#39;ve gone too far,&#34;she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc froze for a second, then shoved her away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>like her words had burned him. &#34;I told you,Haley and I didn&#39;t cross any line. But if you want to go and get yourself a male companion-do what you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wrist throbbed, the ache spreading through her arm. But it was her heart that hurt more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him a slow, mocking smile. &#34;You said it. So when it happens, don&#39;t you dare play the victim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, she turned,got into the car, and slammed the door. Marc ran after her,banging on the window. &#34;Stella!&#34; But before he could pull the door open, Jazlyn and Haley caught up, each grabbing an arm to hold him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment passed, and Stella didn&#39;t wait around. She stepped on the gas and left them behind in a roar of tires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bar was drenched in neon lights and thick smoke, packed with people trying to escape their loneliness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella sat slouched in a booth tucked in the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>corner, already tipsy from drinking too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen the betrayal with her own eyes.Now,every bitter truth crashed into her, cutting through her like blades, mixed with memories that used to be beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me.&#34; A deep, smooth voice pulled her out of her thoughts, and her mind returned to the present in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked, lifting her head. There he was-tall and composed, his legs long and poised in tailored black trousers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jacket was open, revealing a crisp black shirt tucked neatly into his belt, highlighting a slim,well-toned waist. His frame was strong, his chest broad. A sharp jawline, well-shaped lips,and eyes thatseemed to see right through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was dangerously attractive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought,she pulled him down onto the sofa, climbed onto his lap, and played with his tie, her breath warm and sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wanna be my one-night stand?&#34; she whispered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>boldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers lightly brushed his chest. Her eyes sparkled, playful and seductive. &#34;Trust me, we&#39;d enjoy ourselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat up and swayed slightly, tempting like a flame dancing in the dark, teasing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel herself losing control,letting her pain take over. But the man just stared at her with an unreadable expression, not even slightly tempted. It made her feel ridiculous, like she was performing alone on a stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever heat had been building inside her vanished in a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if he was already with someone? Was she really about to become another Haley?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made her sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter smile curved her lips. She let her head rest lightly against his chest, trying to pull herself together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of Marc, she had nearly turned into the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>very kind of woman she couldn&#39;t stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry... I drank too much,&#34; she murmured,retreating into her seat. She curled up in the corner and finished another glass in a single gulp. She didn&#39;t move until the man stood and walked away. Only then did she get up unsteadily and vanish into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Marc didn&#39;t come home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Stella, she embraced the quiet and the peace it brought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, she went straight to the research center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though her participation was already approved, she still needed to complete some paperwork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, who was sorting project files nearby,suddenly looked up with a cheeky grin on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Stella, did you hear? This project&#39;s got serious attention from the higher-ups. There&#39;s a VIP joining us-super rich, comes from a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>powerful family, and still single. Aren&#39;t you even a little curious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would I be?&#34; Stella replied flatly,still looking at her research notes, not the least bit interested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Hookwood Research Institute had a strong reputation, and she&#39;d seen plenty of wealthy heirs come around just to boost their image.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But this guy&#39;s on another level,&#34; Lainey said,leaning over Stella&#39;s desk. &#34;Come on, with your looks and charm? You could have any man eating out of the palm of your hand. Once the research kicks off, your records vanish, your marriage to Marc wiped clean like it never happened. Just picture it-walking in with someone powerful and drop-dead gorgeous,letting Marc see exactly what he lost. Tell me that wouldn&#39;t feel amazing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella finally looked up. Her eyes were clear but cold. &#34;That&#39;s petty. Marc will lose much more than that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, there was a knock at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an administrative coordinator,letting them know it was time to head to the meeting room and meet the rest of the project team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think the VIP&#39;s here already?&#34; Lainey said excitedly, grabbing Stella and rushing toward the meeting room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, I haven&#39;t even packed my stuff,&#34; Stella said, holding her folder close as she tried to keep up. When they got there, she quietly took a seat in a corner and focused on her files.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t look up until a round of applause echoed through the room. Then, slowly lifting her head, she locked eyes with a man whose gaze was intense and powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart gave a sudden jolt. She glanced down and saw the same soft lips she remembered from the night before-lips that looked far too tempting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could it be him?</p>
