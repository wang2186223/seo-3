                <p>Marc waited in the cafe for over an hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His clothes were dry now, but they clung to him cold and sticky, making him feel worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head throbbed, and a low fever was creeping in.He&#39;d had enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he stood to leave, his phone buzzed. A message lit up the screen-it was from one of his long -term business partners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Walsh, the patent has expired. We&#39;ll be pausing our partnership with Walsh Group until further notice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc stared at the message, brows furrowed. Then another one came in. And another. Different companies. Same message. All of them were pulling out-refusing to renew their deals unless Stella&#39;s patent was locked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s frustration boiled over. He tried calling Stella immediately, but her number was blocked. He tried her email,messaging apps-nothing. Total silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was cutting him off, proving she could do things her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc clenched his jaw, gripping his phone until his knuckles blanched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He called a few other partners, trying to salvage what he could. No luck. Everyone gave the same answer: no patent,no deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in a long while, Marc felt completely cornered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With several deals falling through, he needed to find new opportunities; otherwise, the company would inevitably suffer losses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally,he decided to contact Haley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haley,where are you?&#34; he asked, voice low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley was lounging at a spa, fresh off the high of ruining Stella. Her voice was sugary sweet. &#34;At the spa.Why,miss me already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a charity gala tomorrow night. I want you to come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s heart practically did a somersault. Marc almost never brought women to public events-especially when he wasn&#39;t bringing Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a place in Marc&#39;s heart that Stella couldn&#39;t compete with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was already planning to leak the photos and videos from Stella&#39;s humiliation, but now? Now she had the perfect stage. At the gala, once those images were out, Stella&#39;s name would be dirt in all of Choria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc would have no choice but to drop her completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley grinned to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tomorrow wasn&#39;t just Stella&#39;s downfall-it&#39;d be her official debut by Marc&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly texted her mother. Her mother had wanted to secure a deal with Walsh Group,but Haley&#39;s obsession with Marc had caused tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and her mom had a big argument over Marc.Haley had insisted he didn&#39;t love Stella anymore,that it was all over between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her mother wasn&#39;t buying it. She&#39;d flat-out forbidden Haley from playing the other woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was her perfect chance to prove her mother wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tomorrow would be her proof. At the gala, her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>mother would see the truth with her own eyes-Marc,publicly by her side, Stella completely out of the picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the end of the night, Haley wouldn&#39;t be a sidepiece.She&#39;d be the woman everyone was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, I&#39;ll be there on time,&#34; she purred into the phone.&#34;But Marc... I don&#39;t have a dress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc sighed. He knew what she was getting at. &#34;I&#39;ll pick you up early. We&#39;ll go shopping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the best! Love you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc ended the call with an irritated grunt, rubbing his temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This gala was important-he had a major potential partner attending. And Haley, with her Smith family background, might give him the edge he needed to sway the deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smirked. Stella thought she could strong-arm him?She had no idea who she was messing with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want to play dirty. He loved her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if she kept fighting him, he wasn&#39;t above teaching her a little lesson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Marc showed up early to take Haley shopping-he knew how long she could take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew her routine, so he arrived just in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she fussed over dresses, Marc waited on the boutique&#39;s sofa, flipping half-heartedly through a fashion magazine. His mind wasn&#39;t on fabrics or colors.He was already thinking about his pitch to the new investor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marc, what about this one?&#34; Haley called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking up, he muttered, &#34;Yeah. Looks good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s smile faltered. Could he be thinking about Stella? She marched over, grabbed his face,and forced him to look at her. &#34;Really? You haven&#39;t even seen it. Look properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc sighed and pulled himself back into the moment.He gave her a quick once-over, then wrapped an arm around her waist. &#34;It suits you. The color works with your skin tone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was enough to satisfy her. She flashed a triumphant smile and told the sales clerk that she&#39;d take the dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she headed off to get her makeup done,leaving</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc to wait-again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned back and let his eyes drift shut for a second.And just like that, his mind went to Stella. She never wasted time on makeup or elaborate clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A simple T-shirt, a ponytail, and she still looked effortlessly stunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting ready with her took ten minutes, tops.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not like Haley, who took the whole day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours later, everything was finally done, and they headed to the gala.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The venue was buzzing-full of elites from Choria&#39;s upper crust. As Marc and Haley entered, heads turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers followed them like shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s the woman with Mr. Walsh? Isn&#39;t she the Smith girl? From Achury?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re awfully close... Are they having an affair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone gasped, &#34;No way. Would an Achury noblewoman really stoop to being a mistress? Or did Mr.Walsh already divorce his wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word divorce cut through the buzz of voices and hit Marc like a slap. His jaw clenched. His expression froze. That one word rattled something deep inside him.</p>
