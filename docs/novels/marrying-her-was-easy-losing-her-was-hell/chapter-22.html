                <p>William&#39;s Lap</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella fumbled to hit pause, another surge of nausea churning in her gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lurched over the sink and vomited, her stomach empty except for the sour burn of bile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing but acid came up-she hadn&#39;t managed more than a few bites all day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made her skin crawl with pure revulsion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never in her wildest nightmares had Stella thought Haley would send her an audio recording like this-audio of her and Marc having sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of sick person not only made something like that but sent it out on purpose?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella stared at her reflection, pressing a hand to her chest. This wasn&#39;t the reaction she&#39;d imagined. No heart pounding, no crushing weight of emotion-just a vague nausea and a strange emptinesS.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, she&#39;d always suspected Marc could sink this low-nothing about him managed to shock her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing that truly grated on her was listening to that revolting recording.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few steadying breaths, Stella smoothed down her hair, slung her bag over her shoulder, and walked out of the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside Light Story, Lainey waited beneath the glow of the entrance lights, her figure striking in a stunning evening gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Stella climbed out of the taxi, Lainey spotted her and waved with unrestrained enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in a neat white blouse and faded jeans, Stella looked more ready for a business meeting than a night out drinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s lips twitched with disapproval as she looped her arm through Stella&#39;s. &#34;Stella, what&#39;swith this outfit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella blinked and glanced at herself, genuinely puzzled. &#34;Is there something wrong with what I&#39;m wearing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d picked these clothes on purpose-clean lines,nothing flashy, just right for the occasion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We came out to have drinks, not sign contracts. You</p>
                
                
                
                <p>look like you&#39;re about to pitch a business deal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella exhaled, resigned. &#34;Fine... Lainey, can we just head inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lainey dug in her heels, tugging Stella back.&#34;Absolutely not. You&#39;re already here, so you need to look the part. Otherwise, how do you expect William to pay any attention to you?&#34; She grinned, triumphant,and held up a garment bag. &#34;Good thing I planned ahead.You&#39;re changing-no arguments.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Stella could utter another word, Lainey swept her straight into the restroom at Light Story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chatting animatedly, Lainey rummaged through her bag and produced a dark red slip dress, thrusting it into Stella&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lainey, is this honestly necessary?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely! Come on, try it. You&#39;re gorgeous-let everyone see it for once!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no room to argue, Stella ducked into a stall and reluctantly changed clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping out in the new outfit, she felt like she&#39;d borrowed someone else&#39;s skin-uncomfortable and unsure. &#34;Lainey, isn&#39;t this dress a little.,. too daring?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tugged self-consciously at the hem, certain the dress barely concealed anything front or back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey surveyed her, beaming with approval. &#34;It&#39;s perfect-definitely not too short. You look absolutely gorgeous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her striking curves, smooth skin, and a face made for trouble, Stella belonged in a dress that broadcasted boldness, not hidden away in something dull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she wore before? A style disaster begging for a makeover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scooping up Stella&#39;s discarded shirt and jeans, Lainey crammed them into her bag and steered Stella down the hall toward the private room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s William&#39;s childhood friend&#39;s birthday tonight.Everyone&#39;s here to unwind-so make sure you give William something to look at.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unsure how to say she wasn&#39;t there to impress William,Stella stayed quiet and trailed after Lainey into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Light flooded the largest private room as the doors swung open,revealing a lively crowd of well over a hundred, clustered in animated groups. The air</p>
                
                
                
                <p>thrummed with the energy and confidence of the city&#39;s young elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey guided Stella through the crowd, stopping before a tall man with gleaming gold-rimmed glasses.&#34;Grady, meet Stella Russell-she was a few grades behind me back in school. And Stella, this is my friend,Grady Martel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella had never seen Grady before, but out of courtesy, she offered a gentle smile. &#34;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you,Mr.Martel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grady, accustomed to people fawning over William,pegged Stella as just another face in the crowd,one of the many hoping for an introduction. Nearly everyone in the city, after all, was desperate to win William&#39;s favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment he laid eyes on Stella,Grady faltered.Her striking beauty caught him completely off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat and casually grabbed a cocktail from the bar, lifting the glass in Stella&#39;s direction.&#34;Ms.Russell, here&#39;s a bit of advice-take your time. Plenty of people try to cozy up to William, but he doesn&#39;t make it easy for just anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella could tell exactly what he was implying, but her only concern was settling the list situation as fast aspossible. She offered a stiff nod, feeling her discomfort creeping into her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few more polite exchanges, Lainey hooked her arm around Stella and guided her straight toward William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A noisy crowd had gathered around him, and Lainey had to nudge her way through before they finally made it to the sofa where William lounged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her glass in greeting, Lainey called out,&#34;Mr.Briggs, what a shock running into you here! This is Stella-she&#39;s a colleague of mine at the institute.1think you two might&#39;ve crossed paths before. She&#39;s actually got some questions about a project and would really appreciate your insights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey gave her a light nudge before she could brace herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nudge wasn&#39;t forceful, but Stella was already off -balance-she tripped forward and toppled straight toward William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She braced for impact, but the sting of a fall never came. Blinking in surprise, she realized she&#39;d landed squarely in William&#39;s lap-and the position was far too intimate for comfort.</p>
