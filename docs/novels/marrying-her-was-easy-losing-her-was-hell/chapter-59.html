                <p>Haley was panicking, backing away in a frenzy.&#34;No! I didn&#39;t do anything wrong! Why should I go with you? I&#39;m not going-don&#39;t touch me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The police didn&#39;t even flinch. Her outburst didn&#39;t faze them one bit. When she wouldn&#39;t cooperate, one of the officers calmly reached for the handcuffs on his belt. &#34;We&#39;d appreciate your cooperation, ma&#39;am. If you&#39;re really innocent, the truth will come out. Justice always does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That word-justice-sent Haley into full-blown hysteria. &#34;MAom, say something! We&#39;re not from here, we don&#39;t know how things work! Stella&#39;s lying! Please-do something!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice looked just as helpless. She reached out, but with the cuffs already closingin,there</p>
                
                
                
                <p>was nothing she could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could only watch as her precious daughter was led away in shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Jazlyn had been slowly trying to sneak off through the crowd. But the moment she heard the officers call her name, she froze like a deer in headlights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jazlyn Walsh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned around, visibly shaking. &#34;Officer-l swear, I don&#39;t know anything! I&#39;ll come with you.I&#39;ll tell you everything I do know!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be fair, she really didn&#39;t know much. Haley had done most of the scheming on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Jazlyn wasn&#39;t resisting, the officers didn&#39;t cuff her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One look at her terrified face, and it was clear she wasn&#39;t the ringleader. Two down. One to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc never expected Stella to pull this move-calling the police right there at the gala and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>having them take him too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might&#39;ve tried to slip away quietly, but Jazlyn, clueless as ever, called out to him,blowing his cover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, the grand charity gala came to a crashing, scandalous end. Guests stood around whispering, wide-eyed and stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Marc taken away, Stella finally turned to leave. She hadn&#39;t come to party anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; a calm voice asked beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to see William walking up, his tone low and casual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Back to the research center,&#34; she answered truthfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since deciding to end things with Marc, she hadn&#39;t stepped foot in the villa. She&#39;d already packed up anything important. No reason to go back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William nodded. &#34;That&#39;s on my way. I&#39;ll drop you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella blinked, surprised. It was already late-was he heading there too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need, Mr. Briggs. I can manage,&#34;she said quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to keep riding around in his car.She already owed himn a favor-racking up more debt wasn&#39;t part of the plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William just kept walking beside her and smirked. &#34;I help you out once and now you&#39;re trying to keep your distance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That comment caught her off guard, and she flushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, she owed him thanks for earlier-but what did that have to do with getting in his car?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she said nothing and awkwardly followed him to the vehicle. She opened the door, slipped inside, and sat quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca was driving. Stella and William sat in the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her flustered state, she forgot to fasten her seatbelt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ride was smooth at first, the silence almost comforting. Stella let herself relax just a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, at a junction, the car made a sharp turn and suddenly braked hard. Before she could react, her body lurched sideways-and she crashed right into William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands shot out to steady herself, but it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slammed straight into his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And to make things worse, her chest-soft and unprotected-ended up pressed right against his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if that wasn&#39;t enough, the sudden jolt tugged at her clothes, and with a loud snap, one of the buttons on her blouse popped open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella froze, her face burning. If there was ever a moment to disappear, this was it. She seriously wished the ground would open up and swallow her whole.</p>
