                <p>Stella froze for a second. She turned and found it was WVilliam. He was now walking toward the garage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a few steps before realizing she wasn&#39;t behind him. Turning around with a slight frown,he asked, &#34;Aren&#39;t you coming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was momentarily at a loss. Wasn&#39;t he supposed to have left with the project team?Why was he still here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mind reeling with questions, Stella followed him to the parking lot, where she watched him effortlessly lift her suitcase with one hand and place it in the trunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the driver&#39;s side door but glanced back at her before getting in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get in.&#34; Two words, low and firm. Not a request.A command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella hesitated but finally climbed into the passenger seat. After all, her suitcase was already held hostage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Briggs, weren&#39;t you supposed to leave with the project team? Why are you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She trailed off. She wanted to ask why he was here and where he was taking her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The questions were stacking, but William didn&#39;t seem eager to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he fired up the engine, and the car shot forward like a bullet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they sped past the institute&#39;s gates, Stella spotted Marc out front, pacing like a man possessed. Her heart jumped, and she instinctively turned her face away from the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence inside the car grew thick. She occasionally glanced at William, who was focused on driving, as if she wasn&#39;t even there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella tried to break the silence. &#34;Mr. Briggs, did you see Marc out there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t even glance at her. &#34;Do I look blind to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked, caught off guard. &#34;Sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a dry, humorless laugh, as though her apology was pointless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t the one who invited Marc there. Why was she apologizing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella exhaled, her voice low. &#34;If I hadn&#39;t gone to that charity event last night, maybe he wouldn&#39;t have shown up today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t regret confronting Marc-only the trouble it brought to everyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That guilt weighed heavier than her own anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s very. considerate of you,&#34; William said with a soft chuckle, but his tone made her wonder if he was mocking her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella fell silent. She didn&#39;t even ask where they were headed. She figured wherever it was, he probably wasn&#39;t driving her off a cliff. -</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stoplight ahead turned red. As the countdown ticked, William finally spoke again.&#34;The core project members&#39; names aren&#39;t public. For confidentiality. The list that went out was only partial.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella blinked. Her breath hitched. She stared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he saying...?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean... I&#39;m on the confidential list?&#34; she asked, voice rising slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t answer, only hit the gas when the light turned green.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Stella leaned forward, eyes shining with hope. &#34;I&#39;m willing to join. Are we heading to the team now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what role she was assigned, she was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>eager to join the team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a soft &#34;Mm&#34; in response. Then added casually, &#34;But if you join... have you thought about what to do with your husband?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tensed.William continued, &#34;He&#39;s not going to let this go. Especially now that you didn&#39;t show.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella leaned back slowly, her voice calm but cold. &#34;I&#39;m done with him. I&#39;ve signed the divorce papers. Once I&#39;m on the project team, I&#39;ll erase every trace ofmyself. Let him think I&#39;m dead for all I care. Let him regret it for the rest of his life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William gave her a sidelong glance.Letting Marc believe she was dead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was... intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,he couldn&#39;t help but raise an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella stared out the window, watching the scenery blur past. &#34;Besides, he has bigger problems. The patent theft, the stuff with Haley</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-he&#39;ll be too busy dealing with that mess to even think about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice had a trace of satisfaction. It was ironic,really.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley had tried to destroy her, and in the end,she&#39;d dragged Marc down with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone as selfish as Marc wouldn&#39;t have come today unless he thought it served his interests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made Stella chuckle coldly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William glanced her way, taking her in. There was something new in his eyes-something closer to recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She definitely wasn&#39;t the naive woman people mistook her for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she decided to be tough, she didn&#39;t just dip her toe in-she dove straight into the fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And strangely, William admired that about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blind submission was dull. Mindless rebellion?Just exhausting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Stella struck a rare balance-soft where it mattered, sharp where it counted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d clearly learned where the line was-and when to cross it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, he spoke again. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about Marc. The institute will deal with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella blinked at him but didn&#39;t question it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever handled Marc... he was no longer her problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the institute&#39;s entrance, Marc was still yelling,demanding to see Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew she was still in there-she hadn&#39;t returned home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were wild. His fists slammed against the gate. &#34;If she doesn&#39;t come out,| swear-l&#39;ll tear this whole damn place down!&#34;</p>
