                <p>Marc&#39;s voice was gentle, almost teasing, and the ends of his damp hair brushed lightly against Stella&#39;s cheek. But instead of stirring any warmth in her heart, the touch made her skin prickle with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After discovering the affair with Haley, Stella had drawn a line. Whenever Marc reached for her,she always had a reason-any reason-not to let him near.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands wandered aimlessly, never crossing the boundary she hadn&#39;t allowed. He was careful not to touch the places that would really make her react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was holding back-waiting for her to say yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time when that kind of restraint meant everything to her. It had felt like love-that no matter how much he wanted her, he would never push her beyond her will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She used to believe it was his way of loving her.But now she understood-when he didn&#39;t get what he wanted, he simply turned to someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was his idea of love. What a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, don&#39;t be like this. You know you&#39;re the only one I care about,&#34; he whispered, the words sliding off his lips with the ease of someone who&#39;d said them a hundred times before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The taste of bile crept up her throat, but she kept it down. Gently placing a hand on his chest,she sad, &#34;Let me freshen up first, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her response caught him off guard. His eyes lit up, hopeful. He leaned in, brushed a kiss by the edge of her lips, and murmured, &#34;No need.I don&#39;t mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, she laughed bitterly. She knew this game well. If she pushed him away now, he&#39;d only get more insistent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft, almost sweet smile, she whispered,&#34;I want tonight to feel special, something to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>remember. I won&#39;t take long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fake tenderness in her eyes was all he needed. It puffed up his pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, all her anger was just an emotional phase-nothing serious. She still loved him.He was sure of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the bathroom, she stared at her reflection-cold, composed, emotionless. None of the softness she&#39;d just shown remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d made sure to bring her phone. Turning on the rear camera, she snapped a mirror shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kiss he left on her neck had stained her skin like a bruise-faint but noticeable in the picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She perched on the toilet seat and calmly sent the photo, along with the earlier bed shots to Haley. Then she sat still and began to count.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, just a few seconds later, Marc&#39;s phone lit up with a call from outside the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella twisted the faucet open, letting the sound</p>
                
                
                
                <p>of rushing water drown out any voices coming from the bedroom. A few minutes passed before Marc&#39;s knock sounded lightly against the bathroom door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, something urgent came up at the office.I&#39;ve got to go. Don&#39;t wait up-just get some rest after your shower.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at her lips, laced with irony and quiet disbelief. So eager to leave, huh? She hadn&#39;t even stepped out of the bathroom,and he was already halfway out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood still, listening as the bedroom door clicked shut. Then, with a steady breath, she opened the bathroom door and looked around.The room was quiet and empty. Her heart sank a little more at the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had planned this from the start-sending those photos to Haley, knowing full well that Haley&#39;s jealousy would spark an immediate reaction. And it had worked. Like clockwork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, deep inside, a tiny voice-faint and foolish -had hoped Marc would hesitate. That he might stay. That he&#39;d choose her, just once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But once again,reality proved crueler than hope.Marc, who swore he loved her, had dropped everything and run to Haley without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it really possible to share love like that-half for a wife, half for another woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella had already packed the things she cared about. Her suitcase sat quietly in the corner of the room, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Marc had really meant all those words,he would&#39;ve seen that most of her things were already gone from the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t. He noticed nothing,too sure of himself, thinking she would never actually walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing left in that room that still connected them was the wedding photo on the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at their smiling faces in that picture,and her eyes filled with tears she hadn&#39;t let fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It only took a few short years for their shared dreams to fall apart and turn into two separate lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She once thought marrying Marc was the best thing that ever happened to her. Now she knew how badly she was mistaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella took the photo out of its frame and quietly walked to the backyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, she found an old metal basin, tucked near the shed. She placed the photo inside,doused it in gasoline, and lit a match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flames flared up, lighting her face in a warm glow. The heat wrapped around her like a final goodbye to everything she and Marc once had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the photo burned halfway through,she heard the front door creak open. Her heart skipped a beat as she turned and saw Marc walking in.</p>
