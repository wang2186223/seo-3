                <p>Stella waved her hand with a sharp flick, her expression dripping with contempt. &#34;Ms. Smith,those three slaps were just a taste of what you&#39;ll get if you ever try spewing garbage in front of me again.Next time, you won&#39;t be so lucky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley pressed her hands to her stinging cheeks and fled in tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice cast a frosty look in Stella&#39;s direction before turning to leave as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the scene finally over, the onlookers quietly drifted away, and Terence headed upstairs to make his report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through the banquet, the host, Saul,appeared at the top of the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in a rich blue suit, he radiated a vigorous energy that belied the silver streaks in his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Saul descended the staircase, guests immediately clustered around him, their faces beaming with flattery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Happy birthday, Mr. Vance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Many more years of good health and fortune, Mr.Vance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chorus of well-wishes echoed throughout the hall, but Stella lingered quietly at the back,unfazed by the excitement swirling around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley and Beatrice, catching sight of Saul at last,lit up with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to be first, Haley shoved past the crowd, clutching her gift tightly, her stinging cheek forgotten in her eagerness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped up to Saul and offered the box with both hands. &#34;Saul, I picked out something special for you-a vintage tobacco pipe. I searched everywhere for it. It&#39;s one of a kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words earned a few surprised looks from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in the city knew Saul&#39;s weakness for antiques.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By choosing an old tobacco pipe, Haley had clearly played to his tastes-there was no doubt this gift would hit the mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saul accepted the box, lifted the lid, and regarded the contents with a measured gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After only a moment, he snapped tne pox snul,his face unreadable. &#34;Take it away and put it with the others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously,that was how it ended?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment flashed in Haley&#39;s eyes as she exchanged a look with Beatrice, confused by Saul&#39;s impassive reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had the tobacco pipe failed to impress him after all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, she&#39;d pictured Saul lighting up with joy-she&#39;d even planned to take the chance to whisper her grievances about Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, his face gave nothing away, leaving Haley at a loss, uncertain and unwilling to risk any playful gestures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley, jittery and desperate to deflect Saul&#39;s irritation, scanned the room for an easy target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze landed on Stella, who lingered quietly at the back of the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly spark ignited in Haley&#39;s eyes as she raised her voice. &#34;Ms. Gilbert, since you&#39;ve come all this way for the birthday banquet, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve prepared a meaningful gift for Saul, haven&#39;t you?He did speak up for you earlier-why not take this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>chance to show everyone your present?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd shifted, parting to give Stella space as every pair of eyes fell on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With everyone watching, Stella moved forward with steady composure, her features unflinching and serene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She approached Saul and offered her gift with measured grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our Briggs Group prepared this gift for you, Mr.Vance-wishing you strength and longevity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Saul lifted the lid, a gleaming amber tobacco pipe rested inside, catching the light with a warm, golden glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amber, often called the jewel of time, was exceptionally rare. Stella had unearthed this particular ten-thousand-year-old specimen during her work at the research institute,making it all the more extraordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given Saul&#39;s seventy-six years, Stella&#39;s offering carried a subtle message: may his life remain steady and enduring, like the ancient amber,imbued with depth and meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saul&#39;s brows inched upward, ready to respond,when Haley let out a disdainful laugh. &#34;Amber?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please. That&#39;s just a chunk of resin-totally worthless. You&#39;d find piles of this stuff at any street stall, and only you, Ms. Gilbert,would have the nerve to give something so cheap to Saul.Aren&#39;t you worried people are laughing behind your back? Honestly, this isn&#39;t even good enough to leave outside as a decoration. If I were Briggs Group, I&#39;d be embarrassed to have you on my team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella glanced over her shoulder, the corners of her mouth tilting into a cold, almost amused smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley wasn&#39;t just rude; her words betrayed her complete lack of sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Saul spoke up, his tone deliberate and clear. &#34;This is wonderful-I&#39;m very fond of it.Terence, bring it up to my study. I&#39;d like to keep it close so I can see it every day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terence offered a respectful nod, handling the amber tobacco pipe wvith care as he took it from Stella, his expression solemn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley froze in disbelief, mirroring the surprise etched on everyone else&#39;s faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could a simple amber trinket win Saul over so completely?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley and Beatrice traded a look, each scowling in silent frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Saul, why...&#34; Haley faltered, her voice rising.&#34;Didn&#39;t you like the antique I picked out? What&#39;s so special about this amber? If you&#39;re fond of it,I can get you plenty more!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t accept it-the tobacco pipe had taken real effort for her and Beatrice to track down,yet somehow Stella&#39;s gift had stolen all the attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had Stella possibly done to earn Saul&#39;s admiration so effortlessly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saul shot Haley a look brimming with annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t stand her tactless, dim-witted behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for the Smith family&#39;s remote connection to him, neither Haley nor Beatrice would have set foot past his threshold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dismissed her with complete indifference,not sparing her another glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the awkward silence, Stella&#39;s voice came across soft and composed. &#34;Ms. Smith, it&#39;s not that Mr. Vance disliked your gift. The issue is,the tobacco pipe you brought... appears to be a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>counterfeit.&#34;</p>
