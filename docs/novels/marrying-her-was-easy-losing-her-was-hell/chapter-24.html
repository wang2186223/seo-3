                <p>This whole situation had spiraled out of control, and trying to explain it now would only make things worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the only thought pounding in Stella&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William turned just enough to glance at her,his face blank. His eyes lingered for a moment-sliding downward, deliberately slow-taking in her bold curves before he turned away and continued walking,not bothering to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc stepped out from the bend in the Light Story hallway just as a voice he knew reached his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned instinctively, drawn by the familiarity,and spotted a figure that seemed known yet somehow different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing his eyes,he took a step forward, intending to get a better look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could get far, Haley came rushing out of the corridor and flung herself at him, clutching his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>arm tightly. &#34;Marc, what are you staring at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s jaw tightened slightly, irritation flickering in his eyes. &#34;Nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella trailed behind William, but he made no effort to acknowledge her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated and desperate, she moved ahead of him,cutting off his path by spreading her arms wide. &#34;Mr.Briggs, I meant every word I said. Please, just give it some thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William tilted his head and studied her, his gaze drifting lazily across her frame. &#34;You do make quite the impression. But throwing yourself at me in front of everyone? If I add you to the team now, won&#39;t people assume I&#39;m playing favorites?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s cheeks burned with embarrassment-he had gotten it all wrong. A wave of frustration hit her, and the irritation showed clearly on her face. &#34;It wasn&#39;t what you think! That happened by mistake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where he stood, William could not help but see her curves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His throat moved as he swallowed hard and quickly looked away. &#34;Ms. Russell, you&#39;re very skilled at</p>
                
                
                
                <p>leaving a mark on a man. But I&#39;m not fond of women who come on too forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t care to understand who Stella truly was.Yet, in just two encounters, she had left an impression on him he couldn&#39;t quite shake. One thing was certain -Stella Russell was a clever woman who knew how to attract a man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Stella&#39;s hands curled into fists at her sides,her body rigid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally spoke again, her voice had lost all warmth. &#34;Mr. Briggs, I take pride in what I do. I&#39;ve worked hard to get here-I&#39;m not the kind of woman you&#39;re trying to make me out to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella had given it her all, done everything expected of her, but no matter how much she tried,William&#39;s assumptions about her refused to budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled slowly, steadying her breath as she fought to preserve her dignity. That,too,had value.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t bother you again.&#34; She turned and walked away without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s eyes followed her retreating figure,narrowing faintly, before he turned and stepped back into the private lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he re-entered,Lainey turned toward him.&#34;Where&#39;s Stella? Didn&#39;t she leave with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had exited almost at the same time-yet now Stella was nowhere to be seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William shrugged off the question. &#34;Not sure. Looks like she decided to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey blinked, slightly puzzled, then leaned closer to speak in a low voice. &#34;Mr. Briggs, Stella&#39;s not just talented; she was once at the top of her field. If she hadn&#39;t stepped back for family reasons, she&#39;d be on par with you today. One of the company&#39;s most reliable core patents is still hers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William shot her a dry look. &#34;Really? I thought her specialties were tight dresses and hanging on to powerful men.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was clear mockery in his tone, and Lainey quickly caught on to the misunderstanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s face turned solemn as she spoke hurriedly.&#34;Mr. Briggs, Stella only wore those clothes because insisted. She came dressed in a white shirt and jeans.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To prove it,she rummaged through her bag and pulled out the clothes, offering them for him to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s thoughts drifted to the first time he saw Stella-dressed modestly,confident but understated.Compared to that version of her, the sultry dress had seemed completely out of place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now he realized that the outfit hadn&#39;t been Stella&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he couldn&#39;t deny that she had looked stunning.</p>
