                <p>Startled,Kody rushed forward,steadying Stella before she could fall. &#34;Mrs. Walsh, are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc blinked, surprised by how hard he had pushed her. Even with one arm wrapped protectively around Haley, a flicker of regret flashed through his eyes. His lips parted slightly,as if he wanted to say something, but he hesitated and swallowed the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella, having calmed herself, brushed off Kody&#39;s supporting arm. Her eyes shifted to Marc,and in that quiet stare was a coldness sharper than any slap-icy, detached, and distant, just like the way her heart now felt toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc winced beneath her frostbitten gaze but forced his voice steady. &#34;Stella, enough with the drama. I&#39;ve already told you, this isn&#39;t what you think. Why do you keep putting Haley down?You even crossed the line with violence. This is a workplace, you should leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he softened his tone as he faced Haley.&#34;Ms. Smith, don&#39;t take what she said personally.She didn&#39;t mean it. I&#39;m sorry on her behalf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s anger melted into smug satisfaction as Marc defended her. She slid her arms around his neck,batting her lashes. &#34;For you, I&#39;ll let it slide.But she better stay away from the company.Tell her to get lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s face tightened at Haley&#39;s harsh words.Turning back to Stella, concern shadowed his features. &#34;Stella, this is the company. Can we not make a scene? It won&#39;t look good if this gets out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Stella stood tall, her posture firm and unwavering. She threw the two of them a cold,scornful glance, her voice steady and cutting.&#34;Save the fake politeness. I&#39;ll leave as soon as I&#39;m done. But Marc, you&#39;re truly disgusting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she spun on her heel and strode toward the legal department,leaving the pair locked in their own world behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc watched her retreating figure, and a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>strange knot tightened in his chest. Maybe he had been too rough earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting go of Haley, he massaged his temples wearily and asked Kody, &#34;Where did she go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kody lowered his voice.&#34;Legal department.And,um... Mr. W/alsh, Mrs. Walsh hit herself harder than we thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc paused for a moment, pushing aside Haley&#39;s continued protests as he moved quickly toward the legal department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the quiet legal office, Stella sank into a leather armchair. &#34;I&#39;m done selling that patent.Now that the contract&#39;s expired, our partnership is over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The legal staff exchanged confused looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This patent had been a cornerstone of their collaboration-why was it suddenly being withdrawn?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them finally spoke up, trying to keep</p>
                
                
                
                <p>their tone respectful, &#34;Mrs. Walsh, is there a problem with the contract?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella shook her head firmly. &#34;No issues with the contract. I&#39;ve simply found a new buyer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc walked in just in time to catch the tail end of Stella&#39;s words. His brows drew together,his voice firm but not unkind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, if you&#39;re upset, take it out on me. Yell at me, hit me-whatever you want. But don&#39;t mess around with the patent. That&#39;s serious business. Let&#39;s talk about this at home, alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was it? He still thought she was being emotional? That she was just throwing a fit,and all it would take was a little coaxing to get her back in line?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought almost made Stella laugh. Her expression didn&#39;t change, but the coldness in her eyes deepenedd. &#34;I&#39;m not joking, Marc. The deal is off. I&#39;m not renewing the contract.And if your company continues using my patent without permission, I&#39;ll have my lawyer file for compensation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up her bag with a calm, final motion,turned, and walked out without sparing him even a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella!&#34; Marc called after her, stepping forward,but someone from the legal team intercepted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Walsh, what&#39;s going on?&#34; the man asked in alarm. &#34;If she pulls the patent, we&#39;re in trouble.We&#39;ve got multiple active projects riding on that technology. This could hit our bottom line hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s face darkened. &#34;I&#39;ll handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, he rushed after Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to be acting out of anger. That had to be it. Stella wasn&#39;t reckless-she wouldn&#39;t tank the company over a personal fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he could just talk to her, explain things properly, she&#39;d understand. She always did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Stella stepped into the elevator and called for a ride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she reached the building&#39;s entrance, a sleek black car glided to a stop right before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, she opened the passenger door and slid inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until she&#39;d settled in her seat that she noticed someone else already inside-sitting in the back, wearing a serious, unreadable expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met in the rearview mirror. The energy in the car shifted immediately.</p>
