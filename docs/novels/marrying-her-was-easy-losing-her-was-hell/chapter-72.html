                <p>William stepped forward, his voice calm but clear.&#34;Stella found the plant. There&#39;s a lot of moss around-everyone, be careful. Let&#39;s head back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say much, but his words did two things-first, he gave Stella credit for finding the plant; second, he made it clear her fall was just an accident-not anyone&#39;s fault, but certainly not hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t directly blame Nathalia, but the tone? It was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathalia stood frozen as William walked right past her without even a glance. Her heart sank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He defended Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never used to speak up like that-especially not for someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go! It&#39;s getting dark!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the group urged one another to move. Stella stayed at the rear, gently tugged along by her colleagues, not sparing Nathalia a single look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind them, Nathalia stomped her foot in frustration, seething silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the institute&#39;s communal dining hall,everyone gathered for dinner. Stella sat with her usual group, and Laura Brooks, her roommate, plopped down beside her,practically buzzing with words of praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, you&#39;re seriously amazing,&#34; Laura beamed. &#34;We searched all afternoon and came up with nothing. If it weren&#39;t for you,we&#39;d still be out there in the dark!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few other team members chimed in, eyes filled with admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, how did you even know to check the river?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plants they had to search in the mountain were rare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella gave a modest smile. &#34;I just looked at its properties-it likes moisture and shade.The river made sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, that&#39;s impressive! We should all learn from you. &#34;We&#39;ve been going off pictures and merely matching appearances. You actually read the material?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella shrugged with a soft chuckle. &#34;It&#39;s just luck.You&#39;ll all get used to it with time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She genuinely didn&#39;t feel like she did anything special. The guess had just paid off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura sipped her soup, then suddenly remembered something. She leaned closer,whispering, &#34;By the way... Did you know Nathalia and William used to be a thing?Back in the day. She went abroad for further studies, and their research took them in different directions. They split after that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella hadn&#39;t heard a word of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura continued, &#34;No one really knows who broke it off, but they&#39;ve always been a bit...competitive. Kind of like rivals now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella raised an eyebrow. William didn&#39;t strike her as someone who cared about rivalry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then again, what did she really know about him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura gave her a reassuring pat. &#34;I think you just got caught in their unresolved drama today. Nathalia might not&#39;ve been aiming at you-she probably just can&#39;t stand William.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella nodded. It wasn&#39;t worth overthinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as Nathalia stayed out of her way,she had no interest in getting involved in their past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, Stella headed back to the dorms for a shower. A day of hiking through woods meant one thing-dirt, sweat, and the desperate need to scrub it all off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was rubbing her sore neck and walking back when she suddenly froze at a corner. A man and a woman were standing close-too close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William and Nathalia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where she stood, it looked like they were kissing-foreheads nearly touching,bodies close, heads tilted slightly. The whole scene screamed intimate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella blinked, cheeks flushing with awkwardness. It felt wrong to stand there staring. She quickly turned around and took the long way back, heart thudding a little too fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the reality was different. William was staring down at Nathalia, expression cold,brows slightly furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nathalia,&#34; he said flatly, &#34;I&#39;ll say it one last time-I never agreed to be with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This misunderstanding had been dragging on for years. He&#39;d ignored it for too long,but now that they were face-to-face again, he figured it was time to end it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathalia looked up at him, her voice trembling. &#34;I don&#39;t believe that. If I hadn&#39;t gone abroad, we would&#39;ve been together,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears, and she bit her lip, holding onto one last thread of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William exhaled sharply, the beginning of a headache forming. &#34;No. Even if you&#39;d stayed,I still wouldn&#39;t have dated you. This has nothing to do with you leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no idea where that rumor came from -about them being together and breaking up because of distance-but it wasn&#39;t even remotely true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathalia&#39;s eyes reddened, her gaze refusing to accept his bluntness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not interested in you, Nathalia,&#34; William said coolly. &#34;I&#39;m here to do research. I hope you are too. And I don&#39;t want to see anything like what happened today again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hated drama. Especially the kind built on false assumptions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to walk away, done with the conversation. But before he could take a step,Nathalia grabbed his arm. &#34;Wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, without warning-without hesitation-she closed her eyes and tiptoed up...and kissed him.</p>
