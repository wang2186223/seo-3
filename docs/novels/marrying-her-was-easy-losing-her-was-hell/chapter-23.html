                <p>The onlookers gasped, their surprise echoing through the room at the abrupt shift in atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with William sitting right there, no one had ever witnessed anyone so daring-this woman had taken a leap without a hint of hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone understood William&#39;s reputation: cold,detached, and wholly uninterested in romantic entanglements. Was she destined to be dismissed as abruptly as all the others?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before anyone could draw another breath,William&#39;s voice cut through the tension-steady and calm, threaded with annoyance rather than anger.&#34;Exactly how long were you thinking of sitting like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, Stella froze,realization crashing over her as a hot flush swept up her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started to rise, only to feel an abrupt resistance that sent a jolt of dread straight through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic pricked her skin as she realized her dress had</p>
                
                
                
                <p>somehow snagged on something, trapping her in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any sudden movement risked making things even worse for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William arched a brow, the shift in weight on his legs drawing his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s entire face flushed with mortification. Even if her position wasn&#39;t as outrageous as before, it was still painfully awkward-all the more so because she&#39;d come to have a serious conversation with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Struggling to regain her composure, she blurted out,&#34;I&#39;m so sorry, Mr. Briggs. This really wasn&#39;t intentional -my dress is caught. Just give me a second,please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fumbled to free the tangled fabric, but a mocking laugh sounded from above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Russell, you&#39;ll have to do better than that. If you&#39;re going to stage an act like this, at least put some effort into subtlety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation and embarrassment churned inside Stella.&#34;That&#39;s not what you think, Mr. Briggs. I didn&#39;t do any of this on purpose. I came here today because l wanted to talk to you about the exclusive project roster. You&#39;ve insisted on reviewing every candidate yourself, and I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll consider giving me a shot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plea made William&#39;s gaze drift to her cleavage.His eyebrows arched, dry amusement flickering in his eyes. &#34;Is this your way of earning a spot on the team?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella faltered, realizing just how condescending he was being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squared her shoulders, lips drawn into a thin line as determination flashed in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m serious about joining the project. I&#39;ve published papers in national journals, and I have patents to my name. I&#39;ve even conducted research on this project before-there&#39;s real value I can bring. And, Mr. Briggs,if you let me join the team,you&#39;ll have nothing to worry about. My focus will be on the work itself. I have the skills you&#39;re looking for, and...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, her words seemed to stumble and fall flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did every encounter with this man spiral into confusion?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she tried to list her credentials, William&#39;s gaze flicked down to the woman perched awkwardly on his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s long legs stretched across his, sleek and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>uncomfortably exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a faint, cutting smile. &#34;Clearly, your talents stretch past what you let slip, Ms. Russell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Stella could even process the jab, he rose smoothly to his feet, leaving her to slip from his lap in a graceless heap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flustered, she clamped a hand over her dress, heart thudding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the moment he stood, the supposed knot between their clothing unraveled easily, as if the whole ordeal had been a trick of the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With icy composure, William strode from the room,leaving Stella alone in the awkward silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella lingered for a moment, a sense of injustice prickling beneath her calm exterior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t orchestrated the mishap,yet his accusation hinted she&#39;d tried to leverage her appearance for a spot on the project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw tightened as she debated her next move, then strode after him, refusing to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s long strides ate up the hallway, forcing Stella to pick up her pace, practically trotting to stay close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Briggs, those earlier incidents weren&#39;t what you think. I&#39;m not after anything else-I just really want to be part of the project team. I hope you&#39;ll let me prove myself.l...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She barely got the words out before William stopped short. Stella crashed right into his solid arm,thrown off-balance by the sudden halt-her sexy outfit doing nothing to disguise the impact or her embarrassment.</p>
