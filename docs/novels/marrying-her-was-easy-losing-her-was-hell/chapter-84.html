                <p>Stella frowned, confused. He wasn&#39;t the one she should be thanking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then who was?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven caught the look on her face but didn&#39;t offer an explanation. Instead, he just smiled slightly and said, &#34;I&#39;m looking forward to seeing what you do next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no idea what he meant, but didn&#39;t push it. She&#39;d already said her thank-yous,and pressing for more would just feel awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the partnership officially in place, she figured it was time to head to Briggs Group and update William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Marc had stormed out of the banquet hall, walked a good few hundred meters, and finally stopped. Frustrated, he</p>
                
                
                
                <p>yanked out a cigarette, lit it, and let out a long drag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way he had mistaken her. That was Stella. Even if she pretended not to know him in front of everyone, he was sure of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why was she acting like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah, maybe he&#39;d screwed up in the past,but he&#39;d apologized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d promised it wouldn&#39;t happen again.Couldn&#39;t she at least give him one more chance?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were married for years. Did she really feel nothing-no shame, no regret-for humiliating him like that in public?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rubbed the bridge of his nose, a wave of helplessness washing over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far behind, Haley stood fuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the past six months, she&#39;d given everything to Marc-risked cutting ties with her family, begged her father to support</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walsh Group, and endured it all. And now?With Stella back in the picture, she was shoved aside like an afterthought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she always the runner-up? Why couldn&#39;t she ever outshine Stella?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was furious, but she knew better than to take it out on Marc now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Complaining would only push him further away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she wanted-what she needed-was to keep him close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So if that meant helping him get Stella back,then so be it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley took a few steadying breaths, walked up behind him, and said softly, &#34;Marc, don&#39;t get too worked up. I know it&#39;s tough seeing Stella pretend she doesn&#39;t know you. But l think... I might have a way to get her back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc turned to her, eyes narrowing with suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of game are you playing now,Haley?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t believe Haley would genuinely help him win Stella back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked innocently, tears welling up as she looked at him. &#34;I&#39;m not playing games.just want you to be happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That softened him a little. His voice lost its edge. &#34;What&#39;s this plan of yours to bring Stella back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley gave a faint smile. &#34;Think about it. In just six months, she&#39;s changed so much. She even locked in that big project with Steven.That kind of turnaround? She&#39;s gotta have someone backing her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s face darkened. He was ready to argue-Stella wouldn&#39;t get involved with someone else. But then he remembered her getting into William&#39;s car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley went on, &#34;And those tech solutions she mentioned? I&#39;m sure some of that came from Walsh Group. She worked there, right? She</p>
                
                
                
                <p>must&#39;ve had access to confidential info. She probably used it to win Steven over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she spoke, the more convinced she became that Stella hadn&#39;t done this all on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc didn&#39;t want to believe she&#39;d stoop to stealing, but he also couldn&#39;t fully believe she had the ability to pull it off solo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So... if it wasn&#39;t theft, then what was it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if someone&#39;s behind her and she did use Walsh Group&#39;s data... how the hell does that help me get her back?&#34; he muttered,frowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t care about lawsuits or revenge. He just wanted her beside him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley stepped in closer, rising up on her toes to whisper in his ear. &#34;Accuse her of stealing company secrets. That way, she&#39;ll face prison time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s eyes snapped wide open, shocked by what she&#39;d just said.</p>
