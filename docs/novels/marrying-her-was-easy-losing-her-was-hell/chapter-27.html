                <p>Tires shrieked across the pavement, the piercing sound slicing through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William stomped on the brakes, rolled down his window,and scowled as he caught sight of Stella. &#34;Are you courting death?&#34; he barked, voice cold as steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella didn&#39;t waste a second on his temper. She strode right up to the window and thrust the stack of documents toward him. &#34;Mr. Briggs, I just need a moment. These files require your immediate attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s eyes flicked from her determined face to the documents in her grip. For a heartbeat, he said nothing -then hit the door release with a curt motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get in. I&#39;m on a tight schedule. We&#39;ll go over them as we drive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated,pressing her lips into a thin line, ready to protest. But something about his expression made her swallow the words. Instead,she circled the hood,pulled open the passenger door, and slid inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car glided away from the research institute,its</p>
                
                
                
                <p>engine humming quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of them noticed the watchful eyes fixed on them from a car parked just behind and to the right,watching every detail of their exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc had just finished a meeting with a client and,by chance, drove past the research institute on his way back. To his surprise, he spotted Stella at the entrance,slipping into another man&#39;s car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where he sat, he watched Stella flash the man a bright, easy smile-a smile Marc couldn&#39;t remember her giving him in ages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm gathered in Marc&#39;s expression as he reached for a cigarette and lit up, the flame trembling slightly in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly recalled the man from the bar the night before. Now that he looked closer, wasn&#39;t it the same guy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did that mean Stella had been with someone else these past two days?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization made him crush the cigarette between his fingers, embers snuffing out in his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His feelings for Stella ran deep. Throughout their marriage, he&#39;d done his best to give her everything she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had his recent attention to Haley pushed Stella into someone else&#39;s arms?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley was just a fling to him, he would never replace Stella.But what was Stella doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury flared-he slammed his fist onto the steering wheel, making the horn shriek through the enclosed car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella belonged to him-no one else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the Bentley, Stella extended the documents toward William. &#34;Mr. Briggs, my team and I prepared these documents for your review.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William arched an eyebrow, his gaze fixed on her for several lingering seconds, making sure she really was just talking business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An amused smile curled at his lips. &#34;I have to say,you&#39;re a lot more tempting now than when you tried to play innocent yesterday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She definitely caught his eye-there was something about her that set her apart from the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word &#34;tempting&#34; rolled off his tongue, paired with the same charged look he&#39;d given her that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill crept over Stella as she caught the strange glint in his eyes. &#34;Mr. Briggs... I&#39;ll leave the documents with you. There&#39;s no need for me to stay. Could you let me out here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That unblinking stare unsettled her, and for a moment,she felt hunted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s eyebrow flicked upward, but he did as she asked, steering the car to the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella wasted no time; she pushed open the door and slipped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s car sped off without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She headed straight back to the office, burying herself in work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, she returned home to an empty house,well aware Marc wouldn&#39;t be coming back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If everything continued as planned, she didn&#39;t have much time left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She craved nothing more than to vanish from Marc&#39;s world for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing around the house, her eyes caught on small things she hadn&#39;t managed to clear out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d already packed away whatever wasn&#39;t on display,but now she turned her attention to the last traces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stack of instant photos with Marc lingered on the shelf,along with a handful of souvenirs from old trips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In recent days, the demands of the project had kept her too busy to dwell on these details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, with her place on the project team secured and her schedule lighter, those forgotten bits resurfaced,impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fragments of her life with Marc drifted through her thoughts, sharp and bittersweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for the pair of ceramic cups on the shelf,the ones they&#39;d shaped together on vacation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d never actually used the cups-just left them out as a reminder of a different time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In those days, Marc&#39;s attention had belonged to her alone, his gaze never straying for anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On one of their trips, the two of them had caught a rare glimpse of a shooting star streaking across the night sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella could still recall the wish she&#39;d whispered to herself back then-a simple hope that she and Marc</p>
                
                
                
                <p>would always be happy together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, as she remembered it, the memory felt almost laughable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes landed on the pair of ceramic cups, and she let out a low, self-mocking chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People really did change, she realized, and now she finally understood how true that was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a tightness growing in her chest, Stella tore her gaze from those reminders of the past and began gathering them up, determined to throw them out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she started to pack everything away, the sound of the front door opening made her pause.</p>
