                <p>Kody found the whole situation a little ridiculous, but since Marc was his boss, he kept his sarcasm in check and simply told the latter Stella&#39;s birthday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Funny thing was, Kody always had to be the one reminding Marc about her birthday.Eventually, Marc just passed the entire responsibility off to him-picking the gifts,getting the cake, even delivering everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, naturally, Kody remembered the date better than Marc ever did-no need for notes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc ended the call and stared at the safe.His hands were clammy as he punched in the code. Click. The lock released with a soft sound, and the lid sprang open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no idea what Stella might&#39;ve left inside, but this-this safe-was the last thing that connected them. His last shot at finding</p>
                
                
                
                <p>some kind of clue. Some kind of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, there was just a single folder lying there quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart sank before he even touched it.He reached in, fingers brushing the smooth paper, and slid the folder out. He&#39;d barely pulled a third of it free when the words &#34;Divorce Agreement&#34; jummped out at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath caught. His hand trembled, and the folder slipped from his grasp, scattering papers all over the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes locked onto the last page-Stella&#39;s signature, written in that familiar, graceful handwriting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was her surprise? She had already signed the divorce papers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought back to the odd look on her face when she handed him the safe. Back then,he&#39;d brushed it off, thinking she was just hiding something silly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turns out she was hiding her exit plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had planned to leave him since then...while he was still busy thinking his affair with Haley was well-covered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s heart twisted, a sharp, suffocating pain tightening in his chest as he stared at the papers. His eyes reddened, but he didn&#39;t look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Stella had been part of the project team for several days now. Every day she was out collecting samples, trekking through mountains and woods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The samples changed daily, and the difficulty of finding them increased with each assignment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the beginning, she and Williamn could finish within an hour. Now? Sometimes they&#39;d search for hours and still come back empty-handed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella knew it would only get harder from here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aware of the growing challenge, the team had assigned a few more colleagues to join her and William on today&#39;s search.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were all hunched over, combing through the woods, but after a while, it was clear they were coming up short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella stood still, flipping through the reference materials again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today&#39;s target had a few very specific traits -it thrived in moisture, hated sunlight, and always grew in damp environments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ran through the facts in her head, then looked up and said, &#34;Let&#39;s try the riverbank.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her teammates blinked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The river? It&#39;s a half-hour hike from here,&#34;one of them complained. &#34;And we haven&#39;t finished searching this area yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were exhausted and frustrated, and nobody wanted to waste time on a hunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just think,&#34; Stella started, &#34;based on its environmental needs, the river makes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the doubtful expressions didn&#39;t fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think?&#34; one woman scoffed. &#34;If it&#39;s not there, we&#39;ll have wasted all that time. We&#39;re not here to chase guesses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words stung, leaving Stella a bit rattled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then William, who had been quietly standing behind them, spoke up. &#34;We haven&#39;t checked the river yet. It&#39;s worth a look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His calm, firm tone silenced the complaints.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t raise his voice, but the others fell in line instantly. William was their senior-more experienced and definitely more intimidating.No one dared argue with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grudgingly, someone muttered, &#34;Fine. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella glanced at William, a quiet thank-you in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without his help, the other team members wouldn&#39;t have listened to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked side by side, she leaned a little closer and whispered, &#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, as always, looked unmoved. &#34;Don&#39;t thank me. I just want to find the sample quickly. If it&#39;s not there, don&#39;t expect help next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he walked off ahead,cold as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella let out a breath and rubbed her nose,muttering to herself, &#34;He&#39;s really got ice in his veins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They eventually reached the river, the gentle gurgle of water greeting them. Stella rolled up her sleeves and got to work, carefully checking beneath mossy rocks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rocks were slippery and massive, and the ground uneven, but Stella kept going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then something caught her eye-a narrow cave opening, barely visible behind a cluster of rocks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart skipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was dark, damp, secluded-exactly the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>kind of place that plant would grow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crept closer and peeked inside. Sure enough, there it was. A rare, vibrant plant nestled in the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s here!&#34; she shouted, excitement bubbling up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in her joy, she forgot to be careful. Her foot slid out from under her-in the blink of an eye, she tumbled straight down.</p>
