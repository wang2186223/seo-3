                <p>Stella frowned slightly, confused by how quickly Marc had returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half of the photo in the metal basin was still burning, the past literally curling into ash before her eyes. On instinct, she shifted her stance,subtly placing herself between Marc and the basin, trying to block his view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His steps halted as he noticed the flickering flames. &#34;What are you burning?&#34; he asked with a mild frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing important. Just tossing out some old junk,&#34; she replied casually. &#34;What brings you back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t press further. With a tired look, he said,&#34;Forgot something. Just came to grab it,&#34; and walked upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he climbed the stairs, he stayed glued to his phone, his fingers tapping away at something urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forgot something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s lips tugged into a wry smile. She stayed still, quietly watching as he disappeared upstairs and returned minutes later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he returned, the flames had died,leaving behind only ash. He walked over,gave her a quick hug, and brushed a kiss against her cheek, all too routine. &#34;Stella, I&#39;m sorry. Work&#39;s been nonstop lately. Once it eases up, I&#39;ll make it up to you,&#34; he said with a sigh. &#34;If only I could spend more time here with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How painfully insincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone buzzed again. Without even checking the screen, he pulled away. &#34;I&#39;ve got to run,&#34; he said,already halfway out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, he was gone again-no glance back. But Stella didn&#39;t hurt anymore. Her heart had long gone numb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc hadn&#39;t noticed, but she had. The phone screen had lit up while he stood next to her, and it was Haley&#39;s message, plain as day. &#34;Bring the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ultra-thin condoms. If you forget, don&#39;t even think about touching me tonight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went upstairs, opened the bedside drawer,and sure enough-the box of ultra-thin condoms was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never agreed to use them, but he&#39;d found someone who would. Not a single one left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d been in the room minutes ago and hadn&#39;t even noticed the missing wedding photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he really think she wouldn&#39;t catch on? Or was he just that shameless?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc didn&#39;t come home that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time when Stella would&#39;ve stayed awake, clinging to her phone, waiting for a text that never came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But tonight, after burning their memories and cleaning up, she climbed into bed. The sheets felt soft, and the room was quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fell asleep quickly, without a single dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Stella stretched slowly. For the first time in a while, she felt well-rested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she blinked up at the soft morning light,something suddenly popped into her head-the coat. The one she had bought for William. It was still hanging in the closet, and she&#39;d meant to give it to him today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, at the research center, she went up to William&#39;s office, only to find the room empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then,Lainey emerged from the break room.Stella stopped her. &#34;Is Mr. Briggs not in today?&#34;she asked,puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey arched an eyebrow, her eyes filled with quiet amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the teasing glint in Lainey&#39;s narrowed eyes, Stella hurried to explain, &#34;I&#39;m only here to return his jacket. Last time, I had an accident-my period started, and I messed up my pants.Mr.Briggs lent me his coat, that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey laughed, shaking her head. &#34;Relax, 1never said a word. He&#39;s in meetings all day.Don&#39;t think you&#39;ll catch him around here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A meeting made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William held a senior position-of course he was busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey returned to her workstation. Stella glanced around, then borrowed a sticky note from her desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the note she scribbled, &#34;Mr. Briggs, the jacket you lent me was custom-made, so l bought another of equal value to return. If you&#39;re not satisfied, feel free to contact me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she hesitated briefly before adding her number at the bottom.</p>
