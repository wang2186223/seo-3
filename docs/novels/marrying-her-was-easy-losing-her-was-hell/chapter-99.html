                <p>Stella frowned, &#34;Is there any additional assistance you require from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William glanced around the room before meeting her eyes again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile tugged at his lips. &#34;I&#39;m famished. Go cook something for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at him, completely thrown off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he actually treating her like a personal chef?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I skipped the food at the banquet,&#34; he added smoothly. &#34;And I just handed you a company. Ms.Russell, surely you won&#39;t let me go hungry after that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could hardly believe what she was hearing.Part of her wanted to throw something at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after a moment, she calmed herself. William had been unusually helpful today. He said Saul signed because of her skills, but she knew the reputation of Briggs Group had played a role too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella exhaled slowly and convinced herself to let it slide-she could treat it as a small gesture of gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into the kitchen, checked the fridge for ingredients, and lit the stove to start cooking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the living room, William listened to the gentle clatter of dishes and the soft hiss of the stove. He turned slightly to watch her move around in an apron, and for a brief moment, a calmness settled over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting moment, she looked like the perfect image of a homemaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, Stella set down a plate of spaghetti. &#34;This is all there was. You&#39;ll have to settle for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She half-expected him to turn his nose up at the dish, but he simply picked up the fork and began eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say a word, chewing with quiet precision, even managing to make spaghetti look refined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he&#39;d cleared the plate, Stella took it back into the kitchen. She figured she&#39;d clean it properly the next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she returned, William was still sprawled on the sofa. She raised a brow. &#34;You&#39;re not leaving?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reclining with one leg crossed over the other, he replied in a relaxed tone, &#34;The chef at my place quit recently-family problems. The replacement isn&#39;t exactly working out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella gave him a puzzled look and spread her hands.&#34;So?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was that her problem?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You cooked something edible. Slightly better than what I&#39;ve been dealing with. I&#39;ve decided to stay here for a while, at least until I hire someone who can actually cook.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes went wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two of them... under the same roof?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That couldn&#39;t be real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, watching her expression shift, added in a low voice, &#34;Calm down. I&#39;m not going to touch you. Unless... you think I might. Is that what&#39;s making you nervous, Ms. Russell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill crept down her spine, but after a moment of silence, she looked straight at him. &#34;Where did</p>
                
                
                
                <p>you get that idea? I wasn&#39;t thinking anything at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William studied her reaction with quiet amusement. Her slight fluster didn&#39;t escape him.&#34;Good,&#34; he said, his lips curving faintly. &#34;Then it&#39;s settled. Get steak tomorrow. I&#39;m craving it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he stood up and walked toward the guest room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This villa had originally belonged to him, so he moved around comfortably, not needing any help from Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood still, watching his tall frame disappear down the hallway, and suddenly snapped out of her daze, irritation bubbling up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did he mean by saying &#34;it was settled&#34;?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never agreed to anything!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But... he was technically her superior. And this house had once been his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had given her Nebula as well as the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being generous wasn&#39;t so bad. If he wanted to stay for a while, she supposed she could tolerate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a resigned sigh, Stella climbed the stairs.As she passed the window on her way up, something outside caught the corner of her eye, a flicker of light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, she turned to look. Nothing. Maybe she was just imagining things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Walsh estate, Marc stood seething,gripping a stack of surveillance photos from his investigator. With a roar of fury, he swept everything off his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photos clearly showed William and Stella entering the same villa-and not leaving. More than an hour later, only William&#39;s driver exited the property,alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no mistaking what this meant, William had spent the night at Stella&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she still had the audacity to claim there was nothing between them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been convinced Haley was just stirring trouble, but now it looked like Stella really had landed herself a powerful man. And that man was William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s fury simmered well into the night,keeping</p>
                
                
                
                <p>sleep far out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Stella rose early to prepare breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept it simple: sandwiches and black coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William joined her not long after. He took a bite,then cast a sideways look at her and said with a smirk, &#34;Ms. Russell, you&#39;re surprisingly competent at this. The flavor... suits me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella shot him a cold look and silently continued eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once breakfast was over, William headed to the bathroom, and Stella followed right behind him.&#34;Wait-do you even have your own toothbrush?Or a towel? I don&#39;t have any spares here. The ones hanging up are mine, and don&#39;t think you can just use them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her scolding drew a low laugh from William.&#34;Ms.Russell, you&#39;re starting to sound like my mother.I&#39;m going to shower-unless you plan on helping again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella was speechless. She spun on her heel and walked out, refusing to entertain the comment. A moment later, the sound of water echoed from the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That moment had been ages ago. Why was he</p>
                
                
                
                <p>still bringing it up? Was he really going to hold onto that memory forever?</p>
