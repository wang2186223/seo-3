                <p>Deserve It</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Stella tossed the trash bag away and began her quiet trek up the mountain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some years back, she and Marc had gone to the sacred tree to offer a wish for luck, leaving behind a wooden plaque inscribed with their hopes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc had written with boyish certainty, &#34;I want to marry Stella and cherish her forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had laughed then remarking that only time could prove a promise like that-and by the time they&#39;d know for sure, they&#39;d both be old and worn,breathless from another climb to check if fate had listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc had wrapped his arms around her, smiling into her hair,saying a lifetime was exactly what he planned to give her. He&#39;d spend every bit of it keeping that promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing beneath the wishing tree as light rain fell,Stella quietly searched for the plaque she and Marc had once left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the divorce underway, the plaque meant nothing to her now. She couldn&#39;t stand the thought of it still hanging there, silently asking for blessings on something already broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, Marc wasn&#39;t worthy of it. Neither was the relationship they&#39;d let fall apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She searched carefully, sifting through countless nearly identical plaques, and finally spotted theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The red string dangled loosely from the branch,and Stella couldn&#39;t help but think it might&#39;ve fallen on its own if she hadn&#39;t shown up today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ink had faded, the writing barely legible, bout Stella didn&#39;t hesitate. She tossed it into the nearest trash bin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In its place, she bought a new plaque.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, she wrote her own message-just for herself-and tied it to the tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From now on, she would be her own reason to keep going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the plaque swayed gently in the breeze, the rain felt lighter, almost comforting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heading back down the mountain, the rain began to pour harder. She stopped at a roadside shop,picked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>up a cheap umbrella, and continued walking slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unseen in the shadows, someone quietly snapped her photo. After studying it for a few seconds,they sent it straight to Marc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the Walsh Group office, Marc sat behind his desk as Haley crossed her legs, her high heel brushing lightly against his leg. &#34;Marc, how long are you going to stare at that screen? Look at me for once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His frustration simmered just beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella had been increasingly difficult to predict, and now she was outright refusing to renew her contract.With the patent agreement already expired, her decision threatened to cause serious financial damage for the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Haley joined the legal department, several collaborations had fallen apart. She couldn&#39;t manage the responsibilities, struggling with even the basics,and the department was now in near-complete disorder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite being the root of the chaos, Haley acted as if nothing was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc clenched his jaw, forcing down his irritation as he studied the documents in front of him, his expression turning stormy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley, pretending not to notice, shot a disdainful glance at the unsigned contract. &#34;Stella&#39;s being impossible. Why won&#39;t she just sign? Does she really think we&#39;re powerless? If she walks away,we&#39;ll find someone else!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her clueless rant grated on him. Marc shut his eyes for a moment, massaging his temples, trying to keep his temper in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen-and froze. It was a photo of Stella, striking and serene even in the rain. Instantly, he forgot about Haley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how many women came and went, only Stella had the power to unsettle him like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave,&#34; he said flatly.</p>
