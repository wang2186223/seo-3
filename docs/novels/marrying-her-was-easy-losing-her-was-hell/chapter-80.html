                <p>Stella&#39;s careful demeanor seemed to sit well with Nathalia, who smiled gracefully and took the seat next to William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;William, where are you headed after we land in Choria? If we&#39;re going the same way maybe we can go together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But William cut her off without giving her the opening she wanted. &#34;Wherever that is, it&#39;s not along my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathalia was left speechless. All the lines she&#39;d rehearsed had suddenly become meaningless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying that, William got up and walked over to Stella&#39;s side, his gaze landing on Maia,who was sitting next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to talk to Stella about work,&#34; he said plainly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maia had been mid-conversation with Stella</p>
                
                
                
                <p>when she noticed a tall shadow fall over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up, she was met with William&#39;s serious expression. Remembering how strict William could be at the research institute,she instinctively nodded, almost like a reflex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh...sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gathered her belongings in a hurry and moved to the seat William had vacated,offering a polite nod to Nathalia as she passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice to see you,Nathalia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathalia clenched her jaw, barely containing her irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella, on the other hand, was left momentarily speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d just handed him a golden chance to get closer to Nathalia-why was he sitting next to her instead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up at him with a faint, teasing smile. &#34;Didn&#39;t we wrap that up already?What&#39;s left to talk about now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William casually tossed a folder onto the table, his gaze firm. &#34;There&#39;s an upcoming collaboration in Briggs Group. You&#39;ll be handling it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella blinked in surprise. When had she signed up for this? Since when was she dealing with Briggs Group&#39;s business?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could speak, William shot her a cold look.&#34;What? Think you&#39;re not up for it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew he was baiting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But truthfully, the opportunity with Briggs Group was the most strategic move for her right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no reason to turn it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, Stella raised an eyebrow and smiled. &#34;Is this a test, Mr. Briggs? Don&#39;t worry.I&#39;ll get it done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a glint in her eyes-confident and unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>WVilliam&#39;s lips curved faintly. &#34;Good. Let&#39;s see how it turns out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour later, the plane touched down in Briset-the city where Briggs Group was headquartered. Since she&#39;d already accepted the role of director in William&#39;s company, there was no reason to return to Choria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she didn&#39;t expect, however, was for William to hand her a set of keys right then and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at him, puzzled. &#34;What&#39;s this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t even officially started yet, and he was already giving her... something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet warning echoed in her mind, &#34;Beware of unexpected gifts.&#34; She eyed the keys cautiously, making no move to take them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William turned to look at her, one eyebrow lifting as he leaned in slightly. Their eyes locked, and the closeness between them brought a hint of tension to the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s part of your employee benefits,&#34; he said,his tone calm. &#34;You&#39;re working in Briset now,so this place is yours. The Briggs Group</p>
                
                
                
                <p>makes sure its people are well taken care of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella blinked, raising a brow. &#34;Do all your employees get handed villas, Mr. Briggs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William stood up straight again and shot her a look. &#34;It&#39;s not a gift-it&#39;s temporary housing. You&#39;re free to find your own place if you prefer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he turned and headed toward the exit, leaving Stella pressing her lips together in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no doubt the villa would be luxurious. Honestly, it would be a waste not to use it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that the recent project had wrapped up,Stella officially joined the project team, but her presence was only required as needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remaining time was hers to manage, free from the research institute&#39;s oversight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So using her spare hours to pick up part-time work at Briggs Group felt like a smart move. After all, who in their right mind turned</p>
                
                
                
                <p>down extra income?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella wheeled her suitcase into the villa.Though unoccupied, it was spotless-clearly kept tidy through routine maintenance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spent the next two days unpacking,stocking up on essentials, and giving the place a light cleanup. On her third evening in Briset, she had an event to attend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William had already emailed her the documents, and she had studied them with care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her role was to represent a newly launched firm and negotiate a partnership with SummitRise Group-one of Briset&#39;s oldest and most established names.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she sat in the car, Stella couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that this was William&#39;s way of testing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The success of this collaboration would come down to her own skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the entrance of the banquet hall, she took</p>
                
                
                
                <p>a moment to adjust her coat, then stepped inside-her silver, diamond-studded heels catching the light with every step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doorman held the door open, revealing an opulent, glimmering banquet hall beyond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of her entrance drew attention;people paused mid-conversation and turned toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Briset was far from Choria, few had seen Stella before. But watching her stride in with poise in a designer gown, admiration sparked in their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s that? I&#39;ve never seen her before.Maybe some heiress fresh back from abroad?&#34; someone murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No idea, but that dress? I saw it in a magazine-it&#39;s a limited edition,&#34; another whispered.</p>
