                <p>Stella had been determined to earn her spot on the project teamn through her skills, not by relying on her looks to take an easier path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Samuel finished introducing everyone in the lab,William said nothing, but a subtle shift in his expression hinted at his change of mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning arrived with golden sunlight spilling across the study. Stella stirred on the stiff bed,stretched,and checked her phone. There was a new assignment from the institute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly washed up and glanced at the dress she&#39;d worn the night before, mentally noting to launder it before passing it along to Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she reached the institute, William&#39;s assistant, Luca Chadwick, was already waiting. As the elevator doors slid open, he stepped forward to greet her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Ms. Russell. I&#39;m Mr. Briggs&#39; assistant.You can call me Luca,&#34; he said with a warm tone. &#34;The</p>
                
                
                
                <p>project kicks off in five days, and we&#39;re forming groups so the team members can get familiar with each other. There&#39;s an opening to assist Mr. Briggs with document handling, and I think you&#39;d be great at it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Document handling?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s brow furrowed faintly. Wasn&#39;t that usually an assistant&#39;s job or something a secretary handled?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why offer her a task that didn&#39;t align with her field of study?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After pausing to consider, she asked, &#34;Will I only be organizing documents, or are there additional responsibilities involved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca gave a reassuring smile. &#34;You&#39;ll also support Mr.Briggs directly, helping him with whatever tasks come up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would mean spending more time around William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given how things had gone yesterday, she wasn&#39;t sure that was a good idea. Who knew what he might assume if she agreed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So after a few seconds of thought, Stella politely declined. &#34;Thanks, but I don&#39;t think this position suits me. I&#39;d rather be assigned to another group with my</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca was caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The role was low-pressure, and working beside William came with advantages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most people would have accepted instantly, but Stella had declined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really think this role matches your strengths, Ms.Russell. You could try it out, and if it&#39;s not working,we&#39;ll make a change,&#34; he said, hoping she&#39;d reconsider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella simply smiled and shook her head. &#34;I appreciate it, but I&#39;d prefer someone else take the role-someone better suited for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned and walked off in the direction of the other workgroups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca stood there,watching her retreat, completely at a loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he stood there, unsure how to break the news to William, a tall silhouette drew near, voice low and commanding, &#34;Is everything settled?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s shoulders slumped. &#34;Mr. Briggs, Ms. Russell turned down the offer to join our group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He braced himself for a scolding, lowering his gaze.But the harsh response never came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, William let out a quiet chuckle. &#34;Smart girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca blinked, uncertain he&#39;d heard correctly. &#34;Mr.Briggs...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget it,&#34; William said casually, already walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca remained baffled. But since William didn&#39;t seem bothered,he figured there was no reason to dwell on it either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Stella was knee-deep in project tasks with the rest of her team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaks were rare, and time slipped by quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the official launch fast approaching,every detail had to be finalized, which only meant more work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, we just wrapped up today&#39;s data. Can you drop it off with Mr. Briggs?&#34; one of her teammates asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William held the final say on everything. Without his approval,nothing could move forward.Each team had to submit their data to him for review.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his looks were striking, his cold,unapproachable presence made everyone hesitant to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>deal with him. So, naturally, the responsibility landed on Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing around and seeing her teammates still occupied, Stella decided to go. But when she arrived at his office, he was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He left? Where did he head off to?&#34; she asked,brows furrowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,but I think he&#39;s still heading to the underground parking garage. If you&#39;re quick, you&#39;ll catch him,&#34;someone replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The files had to be reviewed today. Any delay would throw off tomorrow&#39;s schedule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella didn&#39;t think twice. She turned around and raced toward the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once outside, she stood at the institute&#39;s exit, as every car had to pass through here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, William&#39;s sleek black Bentley rolled into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella stepped up to the curb and waved, hoping to flag it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the vehicle kept moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flustered, she realized she had no choice. The review was urgent. Taking a bold step forward, Stella planted herself right in front of the car.</p>
