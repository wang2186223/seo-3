                <p>Stella kept a close eye on William&#39;s face-and bingo, there it was. William&#39;s expression darkened, a clear flicker of anger flashing in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yep, she thought. That classy woman who had just walked by? Definitely his ex.Probably the one who still had a hold on him -the one he couldn&#39;t have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella clicked her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being in the same place, seeing someone you once cared about but couldn&#39;t be with?That had to sting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, she felt a little sorry for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, William was quietly focused on his meal when a prickle of instinct told him he was being watched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced up-and sure enough, there she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>was. Stella. She wasn&#39;t even trying to hide it,either. Her eyes sparkled with mischief, her expression the definition of amused curiosity -like she was watching a particularly juicy episode of a drama, and he was the main act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face turned stormy in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was he, some reality show for her entertainment?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said nothing, just quietly finished his meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he finished, he picked up his tray and strode past her table. Just as he passed by,he leaned in slightly and said in a cool,almost lazy tone, &#34;Ms. Russell, it appears that your appetite is limited at the moment.However, without sufficient energy reserves,it may be challenging for you to help washing my back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella choked on her own breath. She turned beet red before she could even think of a comeback-but William was already gone,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>striding away like nothing had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her colleagues, having overheard William&#39;s remark, immediately turned their curious gazes toward Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you helping him with, Stella?&#34; one asked,eyebrows raised in intrigue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught completely off guard, Stella froze with her fork mid-air. Her face flushed so quickly it feIt like she&#39;d stepped into a sauna.Was William trying to embarrass her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it some kind of... intense task?&#34; another added, a little too innocently. &#34;You know-physically demanding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her colleagues, completely unaware of her embarrassment, kept pressing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All Stella could do was shake her head,cheeks still warm, trying to explain that William was just making a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But-joking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone around the table exchanged looks,like they&#39;d just heard the most absurd thing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>imaginable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man barely spoke to anyone, let alone joked. If he was suddenly joking with Stella...what did that mean? Was something going on between them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella managed to finish up her meal amidst the barrage of questions, and finally made it back to her dorm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She showered, threw on something comfortable, and flopped onto her bed. The mattress was firm, but honestly, she felt better than she had in weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaving Marc had been the best decision she&#39;d ever made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before moving here, she&#39;d switched phones and numbers. Marc could try all he wanted-he wasn&#39;t going to find her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a few days, she&#39;d probably be declared missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her name would vanish from any traceable records.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;d be like she&#39;d never existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning on her phone, Stella opened WhatsApp and saw a message from Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, where did you go? Marc showed up at the institute again today, raising hell.Security had to step in to get him to leave.Also, since finding out you left, he&#39;s been searching everywhere in Choria-posting missing person notices, writing these long sob stories online. It&#39;s pathetic. He&#39;s just trying to play the victim again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella burst out laughing. She didn&#39;t even need to look-she could already picture Marc making a spectacle of himself, pretending to be some tragic, abandoned lover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, Lainey didn&#39;t know where she was now. No one did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The base&#39;s strict confidentiality protocols ensured that. And that was exactly how Stella wanted it. She hesitated for a moment,thumbs hovering over the reply box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Lainey meant well, one slip was all it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>would take for Marc to track her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The best-kept secrets were the ones kept from everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she felt a twinge of guilt for worrying her friend. But this... this was the only way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft sigh, she turned off her phone and let sleep take her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Marc was going out of his mind.He&#39;d turned the city upside down-sent people to dig through every possible lead.And still, nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like she had disappeared into thin air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d always thought she&#39;d never really leave him. That she&#39;d eventually come crawling back. So he didn&#39;t take her seriously-until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she was gone. No message. Just gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d called her a thousand times, but her phone stayed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the villa, everything felt colder. The</p>
                
                
                
                <p>warm light she used to leave on for him? Off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate, he rummaged through her stuff-maybe she&#39;d just taken a break, maybe she&#39;d be back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he opened the closet, reality hit hard. Most of her clothes were gone.</p>
