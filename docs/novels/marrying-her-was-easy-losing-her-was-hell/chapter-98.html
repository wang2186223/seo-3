                <p>&#34;What a coincidence, Mr. Briggs. What brings you driving out of the Vance family&#39;s garage?&#34; Stella asked, her voice calm but laced with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had worked so hard to help him secure that deal, only to find out he&#39;d been at the banquet the whole time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he meeting with Saul behind her back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he not trust her to handle it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange sense of being sidelined crept over her,like she&#39;d been underestimated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William glanced at her, his tone easygoing. &#34;If |hadn&#39;t shown up today, do you really think you could&#39;ve walked out of that party without trouble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked pointedly at her. &#34;Haley and Beatrice may not have the power they used to, but they&#39;re still capable of stirring the pot. With their background, causing chaos for you wouldn&#39;t be hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella blinked, caught off guard. &#34;So...you were</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the one who sent the butler to help me? And... Mr.Vance agreeing to work with me-was that because of you too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That last part came out softer, more hesitant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s expression shifted, something unreadable flickering in his eyes. &#34;Are you doubting yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, Saul was an old friend, but that didn&#39;t mean he made business decisions based on friendship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it hadn&#39;t been for Stella&#39;s solid proposal and technical edge, Saul wouldn&#39;t have been impressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t some charity case. Just being associated with William wasn&#39;t enough to swing deals like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella rushed to correct herself. &#34;No-I mean,of course not.I just thought...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thought what?&#34; William cut in, raising an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, embarrassed. He had gone out of his way to support her, and here she was questioning his motives-again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It kind of made her look like a jerk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice dropped to an embarrassed whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just thought... well, I was that good, you know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knew I&#39;d make it for sure.Haha...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William gave her a long, unreadable look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, casually-as if talking about the weather-he dropped the real news. &#34;The earlier negotiation with Steven, and today&#39;s deal with Saul-both were tests. You passed. So now I&#39;m handing Nebula over to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella stared at him like he&#39;d just grown wings.&#34;You&#39;re giving Nebula...to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d only been at Briggs Group for, what-less than a month?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, Nebula was still a startup, but it had serious potential.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every project under its name was rock-solid, and feedback from partners had been nothing but glowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now he was handing it to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; she asked, still stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First a black card, now a company? He was being too generous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William slid into the seat beside her, studying her with quiet intensity. &#34;You always question things.But when you do-what kind of answer are you hoping to hear? What would finally calm that restless little mind of yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella froze. She stared at him, mouth slightly open,heart thudding against her ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was she hoping to hear? The air between them shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next second, William straightened,checked his phone, and said flatly, &#34;But if you&#39;re not confident, forget it. Pretend I never mentioned it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,wait-who said I wouldn&#39;t take it?&#34; Stella blurted, snapping upright. &#34;Why are you so quick to take it back, Mr. Briggs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some things are better settled fast,&#34; he replied,barely moving his lips, his tone unusually soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella muttered three simple words. &#34;I want it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked right at her, his gaze uncomfortably intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s cheeks turned red instantly. The car suddenly felt way too warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flustered, she reached for the window switch,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>trying to breathe, when the car hit a small bump.She lost her balance and fell forward-right onto William&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked. The man was built like a damn rock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said nothing, just looked down at her sprawled on him with an unreadable expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Old trick,&#34; he muttered dryly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed she had a knack for finding ways to fall onto him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassed, Stella coughed awkwardly and tried to push herself up-but instead of finding solid ground,her hand landed squarely on his thigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her palm slipped. She fell again. This time, the landing spot was... awkward. William&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly. He let out a small grunt of pain,his jaw tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella turned crimson. She knew exactly what part of him she&#39;d landed on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mortified, she scrambled off him and flattened herself against the car door like a guilty cat. &#34;I-I&#39;m so sorry, Mr. Briggs! I didn&#39;t mean to-really,I didn&#39;t!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sounded like she was reciting a formal</p>
                
                
                
                <p>apology letter, and William still hadn&#39;t said a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His silence only made it worse. She didn&#39;t even dare to look at him until the car finally rolled to a stop outside her villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She practically jumped out of the car. &#34;Thank you,Mr. Briggs. And sorry again. Have a good night!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three polite phrases. One breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and started walking, but then-click-she heard another door shut behind her. She turned, confused. William had gotten out too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um... Mr. Briggs, you really don&#39;t need to walk me in...&#34; Stella unlocked the door with her fingerprint, but before she could finish her sentence, William slipped inside, right behind her.</p>
