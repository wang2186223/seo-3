                <p>Stella stared daggers at Haley, her whole body trembling with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she got it. This was a trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole thing-Jazlyn&#39;s call,Haley&#39;s absurd demand -it was all a setup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach churned as her eyes landed on the disgusting toys strewn across the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her fists and snapped, &#34;Haley, this is illegal! You think having foreign citizenship means you&#39;re untouchabe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men standing around shifted awkwardly. Fear flashed in a few of their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley was a foreign national.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They might&#39;ve been scumbags, but even they didn&#39;t want to go down for something like this-especially not for a foreigner who could skip town the second things got messy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley rolled her eyes and sneered. &#34;You bunch of wimps. Just do what you&#39;re paid for. If anything goes wrong, I&#39;ll handle it. None of this is on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned back to Stella, voice dripping with spite. &#34;And you-God, you really think you&#39;re on Marc&#39;s level? You&#39;re trash, Stella. You&#39;ll never belong in our world. Wanna hear the best part? Marc knows.He&#39;s the one who told me to do this. You should&#39;ve signed that damn contract when you had the chance.Now, he wants you punished. This is what you get for crossing me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yanked a document from her purse, slapped it on the bed, and grabbed Stella&#39;s limp hand. With one hard press, she forced her fingerprint onto the page.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella couldn&#39;t move. Drugged. Tied up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears burned in her eyes, but she refused to let them fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley straightened up, gloating. &#34;There. Done. This contract&#39;s binding. And since you refused before,the patent rights now belong to Walsh Group-free of charge. No compensation. No way out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tossed Stella a final smirk and strutted toward the door. &#34;She&#39;s all yours, boys. Enjoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, she was gone-leaving only shadows and danger behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A greasy voice rang out. &#34;Damn, you smell good.So soft too. Bet you&#39;ll look real pretty crying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another one chimed in, laughing. &#34;Which toy should we use first, huh? Or maybe just try them all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t touch me...&#34; Stella&#39;s voice cracked,barely a whisper. But her body was too weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the men stepped forward, reaching for her.Bang! The door flew open with a violent crash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell-?&#34; They turned, startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca stormed in, flanked by black-suited bodyguards.Behind them, cold as ice,stood William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Stella thought she was seeing things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William?How could he be here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s eyes scanned the room-and locked on Stella.His expression darkened instantly. He barked, &#34;Get these bastards out of here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguards moved fast, dragging the men out like trash. Their screams echoed down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca glanced at Stella again, then quickly looked away.He knew this wasn&#39;t his moment. Without a word, he followed his men out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,only William remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was his first time seeing her so vulnerable, like a broken doll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked over and knelt beside the bed and examined her, noting that her injuries were superficial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pants were still in one piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He undid the ropes around her wrists with quiet care.&#34;Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she was finally free, Stella didn&#39;t cry. She didn&#39;t speak. She just pulled the bedsheet tight around herself,burying herself beneath it.</p>
