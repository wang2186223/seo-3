                <p>After failing to sway William, Stella left the gathering defeated, heading home with heavy steps. As soon as she walked in, she spotted a new message from Lainey lighting up her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry, Stella. I never should&#39;ve pushed you to change. If it weren&#39;t for me, Williamn wouldn&#39;t have misunderstood everything. This is on me. I handled it all wrong andended up making things worse for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella read the message and let out a weary sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just the clothes-William had always viewed her through a lens of suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She began typing a response. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Lainey.None of this is on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If William doubted her, then she&#39;d make damn sure he saw what she was capable of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d prove herself with the same grit and honesty she&#39;d relied on all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s reply came quickly, weighted with guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, I only thought maybe if you dressed differently,William might actually notice your efforts...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, looking back, she felt like an idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s logic was impossible to pin down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, really, it&#39;s all right, Lainey. I know you had the best intentions. I appreciate you helping arrange my meeting with Mr. Briggs today,&#34; Stella typed back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever happened, she couldn&#39;t hold it against Lainey; the girl had only wanted to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Stella&#39;s patient reply, Lainey finally let herself relax, though a hint of guilt still gnawed at her. She silently vowed to explain the situation if William&#39;s impression of Stella had soured because of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the messages were sent, Stella set her phone aside and began getting ready for bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, the villa&#39;s front door swung open, and Marc stepped inside, trailing a sharp wave of alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s brow creased automatically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so late-she hadn&#39;t expected him home tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s head hung low, messy bangs nearly obscuring his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, he fumbled the door shut and lurched across the room, each stride loose and unsteady as he headed straight for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he drew near, a vivid smear of red lipstick caught her eye on his collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now standing this close, Stella couldn&#39;t ignore the harsh mix of alcohol and some stinging perfume wafting off him, making her nose prickle uncomfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped back on instinct, trying not to sneeze,but Marc&#39;s hand shot out and clamped down on her arm,his fingers digging in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned close, invading her space. &#34;All day gone without a trace, Stella-what were you up to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered promptly, her voice cold and steady, &#34;I was in the research lab. Is there a problem? Honestly,the way you smell right now is making me feel sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc held her gaze, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her composure, showing no trace of alarm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing in her expression betrayed a lie, and Marc,rubbing his forehead, finally let go of her arm. &#34;Alright,then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he&#39;d been overthinking things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella slipped from his grasp and made her way upstairs to the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across town, William lounged in the heart of the lively gathering, a glass of champagne balanced in his hand as he sank into the sofa, quietly surveying the room like an outsider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel Acosta, the head of a research lab, spotted William alone and wandered over, swirling his own wine. &#34;Mr. Briggs, I heard you&#39;re handpicking people for the new project. I&#39;ve been around the institute a long time-would you like me to introduce a few candidates?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William regarded Samuel for a moment,then dipped his head in a slow nod. &#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an easy smile, Samuel launched into introductions, breezing through the first few team members with polished, bite-sized summaries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name &#34;Stella Russell&#34; seemed to flip a switch-suddenly,he was all enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Briggs, Stella&#39;s the standout here-no contest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;s picked up a shelf of awards since college, and her academic work pops up all over the web.Having her on the team is a real asset. She&#39;s the one behind that award-winning paper on biologically active factors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William paused with his champagne halfway to his lips,caught off guard by the revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered the paper well-it had made waves across several fields, with results that spoke for themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, he&#39;d scoured the journal, but the author&#39;s identity had been left out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she&#39;d been the one to write it all along?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind wandered,recalling the unexpected softness of her touch earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he&#39;d gone too far in how he&#39;d treated her today.</p>
