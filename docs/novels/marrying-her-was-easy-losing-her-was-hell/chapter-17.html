                <p>Happy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella walked over and sat down on an armchair,keeping a noticeable distance between them. Marc&#39;s eyes stayed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,what is it you wanted to say?&#34; she asked flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s tone turned serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, there&#39;s nothing going on between me and Haley beyond work. You&#39;re getting the wrong idea.This collaboration with the Smith family could really take our company to the next level. Mr. Smith himself suggested that Haley should gain some hands-on experience by working here. And honestly,with her background in international law and her plan to stay here long-term, I can&#39;t think of a more fitting role for her than the legal department.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he started talking about Haley, Stella silently scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does her joining legal have to do with me?&#34;She thought to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that trip to Hoxphis-of course, it wasn&#39;t about her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>at all.It was for Haley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc leaned a little closer, trying to soften the gap between them. &#34;This is why I brought it up. If your patent stays with us, it&#39;ll be the first project Haley takes on after joining. She&#39;ll be pleased, her family will be impressed, and it helps our company in the long run.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As far as Marc was concerned, he had laid everything out plainly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was about business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They needed the Smith family on their side, and if Haley was happy, things would go smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Stella? All she had to do was sign a document -it wasn&#39;t anything new. She&#39;d always sold her patents to him without much fuss. Today was probably just one of her rare moments of defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she calmed down, she&#39;d go back to doing what she always did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finished, he looked at her with that familiar,gentle expression. &#34;You won&#39;t turn me down, will you,Stella? It&#39;s just a renewal-nothing changes for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella didn&#39;t feel moved-she felt sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze was cold as she spoke slowly, each word deliberate. &#34;So this whole talk... is about using my patent to make Haley happy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of twisted logic was that? How could he say something so absurd with a straight face?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her frustration, Marc frowned. &#34;I&#39;m just being honest. A strong company benefits both of us. We&#39;re married, Stella. Isn&#39;t it normal for a couple to support each other?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normal? The word echoed in her head, and suddenly,she had nothing more to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time he spoke, he somehow managed to make himself even more pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rose to her feet, towering over Marc with a piercing gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my patent,&#34; she said icily. &#34;I&#39;ve changed my mind. I&#39;m not selling. And no one, not even you, has the right to force me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc hadn&#39;t expected her to be this uncooperative. He had already swallowed his pride, offered a vacation,and even put work aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she being so unreasonable?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing his patience, he got up with a hardened look.&#34;Enough. This conversation is over. Go to the office tomorrow and sign the renewal. Don&#39;t act likea child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for her reply, he turned and walked upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella stared after him, and her lips curled into a bitter smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe the truth was simple-they were never meant for each other. There was no use arguing anymore. It was a waste of breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite this, her emotions didn&#39;t settle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes rested on the coffee table, but her chest felt tight-so tight she could barely take a proper breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He really had the nerve to say it was only normal for her to help him-like it was expected, like she owed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made her let out a bitter, hollow laugh.The sound echoed through the quiet living room,soaked in loneliness and disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head throbbed again, the pain from yesterday&#39;s injury creeping back as if in sync with her heartache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, she stayed in the study, curling up alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But deep into the night; she was jolted awake by the sound of someone trying to open the door from the outside.</p>
