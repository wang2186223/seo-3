                <p>Haley&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief. &#34;That&#39;s ridiculous! Why would Saul defend her of all people? She shouldn&#39;t even have the right to be here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terence&#39;s tone turned sharp as he replied, &#34;Ms.Gilbert was personally invited by Mr. Vance. Is that an issue for you, Ms. Smith? Or do you think he needed your permission before sending his guests an invitation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, he was speaking on behalf of Saul himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Haley was upset, she didn&#39;t have the courage to go against him. She pressed her lips together, preparing to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just then, Terence called out, stopping her in her tracks. &#34;Ms. Smith, hold on. You were quite rude to Ms. Gilbert earlier. Mr. Vance would like you to apologize to her right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was steady and clear, loud enough for everyone in the room to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley froze mid-step and spun around, staring at</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terence in disbelief. &#34;Excuse me? You expect me to apologize to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her background, she saw no reason to lower herself and apologize to Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Now,&#34; Terence confirmed, his tone cool and composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s temper flared as her face turned red with rage. &#34;That&#39;s never going to happen! Are you insane? We&#39;re Saul&#39;s family! And you want me to apologize to someone who climbed her way up through men?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terence moved slightly to stand protectively in front of Stella, his voice still steady. &#34;If you can&#39;t offer an apology, then I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to leave. You&#39;re not welcome here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since she returned to the country, Beatrice had been humiliated time and again because of Stella, and nowN she finally lost her temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression turned stormy as she turned to Terence with a sharp, scornful glare. &#34;You get to decide we&#39;re not welcome in the Vance family?Don&#39;t flatter yourself. You&#39;rejust an employee-who do you think you are, giving us orders like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, a flicker of contempt passed through Terence&#39;s gaze. &#34;I&#39;m simply relaying Mr.Vance&#39;s exact words. If there&#39;s no apology to MAs.Gilbert, you&#39;re no longer welcome as guests of the Vance family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice&#39;s eyes burned with anger as she stared at him, but she didn&#39;t act rashly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Saul had really given the order, then making a scene now would only mean losing the Vance family&#39;s support in Sleka-a cost far too great.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet lowering themselves to apologize would be humiliating...people would talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stuck in a bitter dilemma, Beatrice clenched her jaw and gave Haley a subtle nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, the Vance name carried too much weight. They had come here to make allies, not throw everything away because of someone like Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no other option, Haley swallowed her pride and lowered her head in a stiff, reluctant gesture. &#34;| apologize, Ms. Ru-Gilbert,&#34; she muttered through gritted teeth. &#34;I crossed the line earlier. I hope you&#39;ll be generous enough to let it go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terence added calmly, &#34;And one more thing, Ms.Smith. Earlier, you tried to strike Ms. Gilbert. The Vance family believes in fairness, and that includes letting Ms. Gilbert return the gesture.What you tried to do, she has every right to return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s heart sank. She had thought the forced apology was already the peak of humiliation, but now-this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at Terence as if he&#39;d lost his mind.&#34;I didn&#39;t even hit her! She&#39;s not hurt, so why should I just stand there and let her slap me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Terence only smiled. &#34;In that case, you may leave. Mr. Vance has made it clear-you&#39;re not welcome here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s fury bubbled up, ready to erupt, but before she could unleash it, Beatrice reached out and grabbed her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warning in Beatrice&#39;s gaze was sharp and immediate. Haley froze. She understood instantly -this wasn&#39;t just about ego anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her father&#39;s company in Achury had been treading on thin ice lately, and they couldn&#39;t afford to burn bridges, especially not with someone like Saul Vance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His influence overseas could be the lifeline they needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If getting slapped by Stella meant they&#39;d still geta chance to speak to Saul, then so be it. Her mother would help her settle the score later anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley clenched her jaw and forced her voice out.&#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terence gave a satisfied nod and stepped back,respectfully turning the stage over. &#34;Ms. Gilbert,I&#39;ll leave the rest to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella, who had silently watched the entire exchange unfold, found herself genuinely curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even know Saul Vance personally,so why was he standing up for her so directly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it simply that even Saul couldn&#39;t stomach Haley&#39;s arrogance? Or... was someone quietly backing her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either way, she had no intention of letting this chance slip by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes gleamed as she gave Terence a slight nod, then turned to face Haley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she raised her hand and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>delivered a clean, loud slap to Haley&#39;s cheek.&#34;That&#39;s for confusing me with someone else,&#34; she said coldly. Another slap followed without pause.&#34;That&#39;s for thinking you can act high and mighty wherever you go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then came the final one-harder than the rest, echoing across the room. &#34;And that... is for your disgraceful lack of shame.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each slap landed with reason, leaving Haley with no room to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley was left stunned. Her trembling hand covered her stinging cheek as tears welled up and rolled down uncontrollably. All she could do was stand there, humiliated beyond words.</p>
