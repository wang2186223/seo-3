                <p>Beatrice was fuming after hearing Stella accuse Haley. She was certain her daughter hadn&#39;t said anything of the sort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward protectively, positioning herself in front of Haley. &#34;Ms. Russell, y/ou might be bold, but that doesn&#39;t give you the right to spout lies. That accusation is completely out of line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not giving Stella a chance to reply, Beatrice turned to Marc with her chin held high. &#34;Mr.Walsh, I only agreed to work with you because of Haley&#39;s feelings for you. But after this baseless slander against my daughter, I see no reason to continue our partnership.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, she made a show of turning to leave,signaling for Haley to follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley, of course, didn&#39;t want to go. But she was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>scared Stella might actually expose something real. So, even though she hesitated, she followed her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she dragged her feet slightly, watching Marc out of the corner of her eye, hoping he&#39;d stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc, however, found himself stuck between two paths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, teaming up with the Smith family had seemed like the smart move-he figured their power and connections could help pull his company through the storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make it work, he didn&#39;t mind entertaining Haley&#39;s obvious interest in him. She was eager and persistent, and at the time, he hadn&#39;t seen any harm in playing along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, if what Stella said was true, then there was no longer any need to keep up the act. He couldn&#39;t keep pretending for the sake of business, not when it meant letting someone</p>
                
                
                
                <p>like Haley get close enough to hurt Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought hit him hard, and his expression darkened. He turned to Haley, eyes sharp and cold, a storm brewing behind them. &#34;Hold on-what exactly did you do to Stella?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s heart pounded. Trying to keep her voice calm, she said, &#34;Marc, I haven&#39;t done anything!Don&#39;t you believe me? Hasn&#39;t Stella been ignoring you lately and staying away from home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t wrong. Marc had complained about Stella avoiding him, often saying she&#39;d been staying at her work dorm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley had stored that information in her back pocket, and now, she brought it out like a trump card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If she&#39;s innocent, then why hasn&#39;t she come back home?&#34; she added slyly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hit their mark. Marc&#39;s mind spun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella had been distant lately-was there something going on between her and William?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William had connections. Could it be that Stella was leaning on him... maybe even getting close to someone else through him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced over at Stella, suspicion clouding his gaze.He looked torn, as if caught between love and betrayal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still loved her deeply. But if she had cheated on him... he wasn&#39;t sure how he&#39;d even begin to deal with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Stella met his eyes, she understood-Haley had gotten to him. Again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Marc could utter a word, Stella gave him a frosty smile, pulled a recorder from her bag,and pressed play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The speaker&#39;s voice rang out clearly: &#34;Do whatever you want. If anything goes wrong, I&#39;ll handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came another voice-sharp and mocking.&#34;Stella, Marc told me to handle this. You refused to sign the contract nicely, so this is your punishment. Let&#39;s see how proud you act next time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before meeting Jazlyn and Haley, Stella had had a gut feeling something wasn&#39;t right. Trusting her instincts, she had tucked a recording device into her bag-just in case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never took it out, and when she left later,she didn&#39;t get the chance to turn it off before those men grabbed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why the recorder stayed hidden in her bag,quietly recording everything that happened in the hotel room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, during the struggle, Stella had hit the mnen with her bag, which damaged the recorder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yesterday, she gave it to Lainey to see if it could be fixed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And luckily, after some repairs, the recording</p>
                
                
                
                <p>cIem</p>
                
                
                
                <p>turned out to be fully intact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the recording finished playing, Stella walked up to Haley with a cold look in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley stood frozen in disbelief, completely blindsided by the fact that Stella had recorded everything. Just moments ago, she had been so sure of her win-so confident that she&#39;d come out on top. But now, all of that had crumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella didn&#39;t let up. With calm intensity, she stepped forward until Haley was backed up against the wall. &#34;What now, Haley? Got anything to say? Or are you going to tell everyone that the recording is fake? That I made it all up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hit hard, leaving Haley stiff and speechless, unable to respond or even lift her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Jazlyn-who had been standing beside Marc-suddenly lost her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spun on Haley and shouted, &#34;What? You actually sent people to rape Stella? Haley, our plan was just to take some fake photos. That was it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn&#39;s face twisted with horror. As much as she hated Stella, she&#39;d never planned to cross the line into something truly criminal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just wanted to humiliate her with some staged shots-enough to scare her, nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, they were both women. And Jazlyn wasn&#39;t the kind of person to take things that far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had assumed Haley shared her limits, but clearly, Haley was far more ruthless than she had ever imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That realization made Jazlyn&#39;s skin crawl. lf someone like Haley became Marc&#39;s wife, who knew what twisted things she might do if she ever felt threatened or cornered?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a quick step back, Jazlyn put space</p>
                
                
                
                <p>between herself and Haley. She wanted no part of her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in trying to protect herself, Jazlyn didn&#39;t realize her outburst had just confirmed her own role in the setup against Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in ttheverynextmoment,the /room exploded with shocked whispers and raised voices.</p>
