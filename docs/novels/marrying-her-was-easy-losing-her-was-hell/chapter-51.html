                <p>It wasn&#39;t Marc&#39;s first time being splashed in public, yet the crowd still erupted in shocked murmurs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wiped his face, blinking as if trying to process what had just happened. Reaching out,he tried to take Stella&#39;s hand. &#34;Stella, I trust you.Please,just hear me out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t lay a finger on me! I feel sick just looking at you.&#34; Without warning, Stella delivered a sharp slap across his cheek. &#34;This is your idea of love, Marc? Loving two people at once? You call that real love? It&#39;s pathetic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc stood frozen, stunned by the sting, but after everything that had just come to light,he bit back his anger. He reached out again and gripped Stella&#39;s arm-not tightly, but firm</p>
                
                
                
                <p>enough to hold her still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella let out a small cry. &#34;You&#39;re hurting me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He immediately let go, startled, and only then did he notice the bruises and marks scattered across her skin. The sight left him shocked.&#34;Stella, what happened to you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Haley&#39;s face lit up with sudden realization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it had to be true-Stella had actually been raped by those men. The visible injuries alone spoke louder than any photograph ever could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinning with triumph, she released the arm she had been holding and declared loudly, &#34;You keep insisting you&#39;re innocent, but what about those bruises, Stella? Isn&#39;t that the aftermath of your night with them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The aftermath of her night with them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps rippled through the crowd, some even covering their mouths in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in their elite circles, such behavior, though not unheard of, was always kept behind closed doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one ever talked about those things in the open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, here was Stella, showing up to a public event with visible marks and not the slightest sign of shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You only signed the patent renewal yesterday because we caught you, didn&#39;t you? You were scared we&#39;d expose everything.&#34; With a triumphant smile, Haley snatched the contract from Marc and held it up in front of Stella like a trophy.&#34;You could barely stand straight and yet you were still begging them not to stop. You kept saying how much you liked it. Do you really think anyone would forget a scene that disgusting? And now you want to act like you&#39;re the victim?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were sharp, vulgar, and completely indifferent to the people around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The uglier Stella&#39;s expression became, the more energized Haley seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s brow furrowed, and in the next second,she grabbed Haley&#39;s wrist hard. &#34;You know what you did is a crime, right? You could go to prison for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashes of the previous day surged through Stella&#39;s mind, dragging the fear from that moment back into her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc, meanwhile, stood frozen, Haley&#39;s words echoing in his head. What was she trying to say?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Stella really have done something like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought alone rattled him, stealing his focus from everything else-including Haley&#39;s behavior. His attention narrowed entirely on the disturbing possibility that Stella had been with other men. A storm of anger gathered in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment he met Stella&#39;s icy stare,reality struck him like a blow. The cold clarity in her eyes cut straight through his confusion. &#34;Haley,what did you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words came out like venom, barely held back by restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Haley responsible for those bruises on Stella? Had she set something up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s body shook, and for a moment, she couldn&#39;t speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her head and didn&#39;t dare to face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it didn&#39;t take long before she glanced up again, tears gathering in her eyes. She looked at Marc with a trembling, helpless expression.&#34;Marc, please don&#39;t believe her lies. She&#39;s only accusing me because | uncovered the truth.Now she&#39;s trying to twist it all and make me the villain!&#34;</p>
