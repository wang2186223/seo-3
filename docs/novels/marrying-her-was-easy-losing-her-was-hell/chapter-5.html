                <p>Just the memory of what she&#39;d done at the bar made Stella drop her head in a hurry. She could almost feel the man&#39;s intense gaze burning into her,leaving her flustered and uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s ridiculously good-looking,right?&#34; Lainey nudged her with a grin. &#34;What&#39;s going on with you? You&#39;re blushing like crazy. Did you fall for him already? And to think, you were the one saying you weren&#39;t interested just a minute ago!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s cheeks burned from the teasing, and her ears felt hot. &#34;Cut it out,&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, everyone. I&#39;m William Briggs.It&#39;s an honor to join this project, and I look forward to working with all of you to see it through,&#34; the man said in a deep,smooth voice that drew another round of applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella was caught off guard, her embarrassment fading as she looked up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William Briggs?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it really be that William Briggs-the genius who co-founded the institute and had joined a top-tier lab at just fifteen?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her surprised gaze met his calm, unreadable eyes. William sat down casually, his sharp fingers tapping lightly on the table. &#34;Mr. Gibson,you may start,&#34; he said coolly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the meeting was supposed to be just an introduction, everyone was expected to present their thoughts on how the project could be developed further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They began on the left side of the room, and each person shared their ideas in turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella pushed aside her earlier emotions and forced herself to concentrate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being the youngest on the team, Stella&#39;s ideas stood out for their creativity. After her ten-minute presentation, the room responded with applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s gaze briefly flickered with approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr.Gibson,seated next to William, leaned over and said softly, &#34;All those patent projects you&#39;ve been following? Stella either led or helped develop them. She&#39;s extremely gifted.Originally, she wasn&#39;t going to take part in this project due to family issues, but she submitted her application at the last minute. I think she&#39;s going to surprise us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting continued for more than an hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the meeting wrapped up, Stella felt a sharp cramp in her lower belly, followed by a warm,unwelcome gush she couldn&#39;t control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew immediately what had happened.Frozen in place by embarrassment,she waited until the room emptied out before rushing to the restroom across the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just as she feared, there was a visible bloodstain on her white trousers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her periods were never regular, and after everything she&#39;d been through emotionally,this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>one had come in strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her rush to the meeting room earlier, she hadn&#39;t even grabbed her phone-so now, she couldn&#39;t call anyone for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out a frustrated sigh, she blew gently at her bangs, then gathered herself and stepped out, hoping she could slip into the underground parking lot unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment she looked up, she froze.William was at the sink, calmly washing his hands. 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Stella pressed herself against the wall. Her face flushed with heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t go forward, and turning back wasn&#39;t an option either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation was awkward enough,and now it was ten times worse. She wished the floor would just open up and swallow her whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, William dried his long fingers slowly with a paper towel. Then he glanced at her and said in a calm, low voice, &#34;How long are you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>planning to stand there, Ms. Russell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella forced a tight smile and mumbled,&#34;You go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked down to the blue folder she was using to hide her back. He paused for a moment, then casually took off his suit jacket and handed it to her. &#34;Would this help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was stunned. Her face flushed even deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he... notice? Did he see the stain?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The embarrassment was overwhelming,but there was no time to overthink it. She quickly accepted the jacket and put it on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to the nearly eight-inch height difference between them, the jacket hung down just right, covering everything she wanted to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was still warm from his body and carried that cool, clean scent unique to him-reminding her of what happened last night at the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a stiff smile. &#34;Thank you, Mr. Briggs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And sorry... this is kind of embarrassing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William stared at her face, still a little pink. Her eyes were clearly flustered, though she was trying her best to act calm. Then, without warning,he stepped closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tall frame and quiet authority made the air around them feel heavy. The pressure was almost too much, and Stela felt completely surrounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Last night,&#34; he said slowly, his voice low and unhurried. &#34;When you were pulling on my tie and inviting me to your bed, you didn&#39;t seem this shy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah-there it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s heart skipped a beat. Her mind went blank, and she instinctively took a few steps back,rattled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he being so blunt? So shamelessly direct? He didn&#39;t even try to ease into it-just hit her with the truth, leaving her nowhere to hide.</p>
