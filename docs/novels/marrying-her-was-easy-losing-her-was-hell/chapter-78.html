                <p>Marc&#39;s talk lasted for ten full minutes,detailing every interaction between him and Stella-laying bare how deeply he cared for her-and ended with a heartfelt apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stel, I love you. I know I did wrong. I&#39;m not here to beg for forgiveness. I just want to make sure you&#39;re safe. If you choose to stay away from me forever, I&#39;ll understand. I just can&#39;t stop worrying about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once posted, the video spread like wildfire,racking up views and shares until it took over social media again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at the high-security research facility,Stella remained completely in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had long since stopped keeping up with anything related to Marc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, the process for our new identities is almost done. We&#39;ll finally be allowed to reach out beyond these walls. Isn&#39;t that amazing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve felt so boxed in here!&#34; Laura chatted as she lounged in their dorm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella perked up at that and began to ask more questions. What would become of their former identities?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura replied, &#34;That&#39;s all handled. Once we sign the consent forms, the institute sends our families a formal notice, presumed dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Presumed dead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So it wasn&#39;t a rumor after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella found the idea reassuring. She was eager for the notice to go out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally, she signed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back outside, Marc had tracked down Lainey at the research facility. &#34;Tell me where Stel went. You&#39;re her closest friend, you&#39;d know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey shot him a flat look and responded with thinly veiled contempt. &#34;Don&#39;t act clueless now. Haven&#39;t you done enough? You broke her heart, and now you&#39;re here asking</p>
                
                
                
                <p>me? I don&#39;t know where she is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc stepped in front of her. &#34;I knowl messed up. But I&#39;d never hurt her again, l swear it. Just tell me where she went.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey wasn&#39;t buying it. If anything, she felt relieved Stella had stayed silent and hadn&#39;t contacted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a touch of irony, she pulled up her chat log and held it out. &#34;See for yourself. She hasn&#39;t answered me either. Nobody knows where she is. So do us both a favor and leave me alone. Try anything else, and I&#39;ll report you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked away without offering a single clue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc stood there, replaying the empty thread in Lainey&#39;s messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella hadn&#39;t even replied to Lainey. Could she really be...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. He wouldn&#39;t believe that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept searching, no matter how much it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>cost, pouring money into investigators and contacts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, one afternoon, the doorbell rang. Marc opened it to find two police officers waiting on the porch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you Mr.Marc Walsh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression shifted to cautious confusion.&#34;Yeah,I am. What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he&#39;d used every connection he could think of, he&#39;d never gone to the authorities.He couldn&#39;t bring himself to believe Stella had vanished-she just didn&#39;t want him in her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officers didn&#39;t soften their tone. &#34;We&#39;re here to deliver a formal notice of presumed death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc blinked at them, his thoughts scrambling to catch up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the disbelief on his face, one of the officers produced an ID. &#34;Here&#39;s our identification.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc scanned the badge number, reluctant but forced to accept its legitimacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even then, the words made no sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took the document from the envelope and unfolded it. The moment he saw the name printed at the top, his vision sharpened, and a jolt ran through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously?&#34; His voice rose with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That couldn&#39;t be right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The notice was for Stella?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc looked up at the officers, stunned.&#34;This has to be a mistake. Stella? No, she&#39;s just avoiding me. She&#39;s angry, not...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was probably just angry and avoiding him.There was no way she could actually be gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the officers answered steadily, &#34;Sir,we don&#39;t handle these notifications lightly.The cause and date are both listed. Our job was to deliver it. We&#39;ll take our leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because the marriage hadn&#39;t been legally dissolved, the notice was sent to Marc as next of kin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they left, Marc collapsed onto the couch,the document still in his hands. He read it again, and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It said Stella had taken personal leave, and then been in a vehicular incident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still unwilling to believe it, Marc began digging for information about that day. There had been a vehicular incident, exactly as the letter described.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And her name really was on the passenger manifest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He feIt like the air had been knocked out of him. His grip on the document grew unsteady as his fingers shook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was that possible? How could Stella be gone all of a sudden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d finally made up his mind to walk away from Haley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella wanted a child, and he was ready for that, he wanted it too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had imagined rebuilding their life together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever had existed between him and Haley had always been about the investment. His heart never left Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So why had it come to this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The official paper lying in his hands offered no answer, only a brutal, undeniable fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc sat frozen, eyes fixed on the paper in his hand. The entire morning passed in a blur, with the household staff moving quietly,afraid to disturb him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without warning, Marc flung the document to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,no way!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t real. It had to be a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella worked at a high-level research facility one that dealt with classified information. If</p>
                
                
                
                <p>they wanted to fabricate an official document, it wouldn&#39;t be difficult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This so-called notification must have been forged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scheme by the institute to help Stella disappear, to push him toward giving up and signing the divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization sparked a fit of laughter. It was manic and sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d really gone this far, just to be rid of him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attention drifted to the untouched divorce papers lying nearby. His expression hardened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she truly was dead, he wouldn&#39;t sign them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d track her down and expose the farce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaving the paper where it had fallen, Marc threw on his coat and stormed out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By five in the evening, after the institute&#39;s daily operations wrapped up, Lainey made her way out with her bag slung over her shoulder. She was ready to call it a day and rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella still hadn&#39;t texted or called her. While a trace of worry lingered, she didn&#39;t think Stella was in danger, at least not physically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as she reached the main gate and stepped onto the road, a shadow loomed ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Lainey halted and took a cautious step back. Marc stood there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her surprise quickly gave way to irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marc, what kind of mess are you trying to stir up this time?&#34;</p>
