                <p>Stella made her way toward the exit, each step weighed down by a growing sense of unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley and Jazlyn had summoned her today under the pretense of discussing divorce, yet hadn&#39;t presented a single concrete offer. No compromises, and somehow she was expected to fall in line?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella understood Jazlyn lacked formal education,but she wasn&#39;t a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had to be some hidden agenda they hadn&#39;t revealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been turning it over in her mnind since the conversation ended, but nothing added up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she was reading too much into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she didn&#39;t know was that the moment she walked away, Haley and Jazlyn shared a conspiratorial look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk tugged at Haley&#39;s lips. &#34;She really has no idea what&#39;s coming. We gave her the chance to bow out gracefully, and she turned it down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn, standing beside her, nodded with conviction.She had arranged the meeting as a final opportunity for Stella to walk away clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Stella agreed to the divorce, there would&#39;ve been no need for underhanded tactics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But since she&#39;d refused, they no longer felt bound by restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;ll see,&#34; Jazlyn said confidently. &#34;Once her name&#39;s dragged through the mud, Marc won&#39;t even look her way. And by then, leaving won&#39;t be her decision anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley glanced at her, saw the gleam of satisfaction in her eyes, and broke into laughter right alongside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jazlyn, you&#39;re the best. I swear, I&#39;ll be the most loyal daughter-in-law you&#39;ve ever had.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The location they&#39;d picked for the meeting was on the third floor. As Stella walked toward the elevator,the doors slid open, revealing a man standing quietly,hands folded behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him a quick glance, then stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, something about sharing that tight space with a stranger unsettled her. She instinctively moved to the far corner, positioning herself near the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head tilted slightly downward, eyes fixed on the floor-or so it seemed. In truth, she was watching him closely from the edge of her vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he took a step in her direction, her breath caught. Her body stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was faster than she expected. Before she could react, he clamped a cloth over her mouth and nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s eyes widened as panic set in, her limbs thrashing in resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp, chemical odor hit her immediately, harsh and overpowering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator, worn and sluggish, continued its slow descent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had entered on the third floor. The first floor was still far off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes shut tight, Stella lashed out with both arms,throwing every ounce of strength she had left. Even as the fog pressed in, she held her breath, clinging to the last shred of consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator dinged. As the doors slid open, she landed a forceful kick at the man. In a split second,she slipped from his grip and bolted away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the lounge adjacent to the banquet hall on the first floor of Voyage Hotel, Luca handed a glass of champagne to William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew all too well how much William disliked events like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Briggs, I really believe Ms. Russell is the ideal choice for the project. She&#39;s head and shoulders above the others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca truly believed it was unfortunate that Stella wasn&#39;t part of the project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t wrap his head around why she had been excluded.Wasit	reallystill	about	the misunderstandings?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated, then added, &#34;Also, earlier today, when she saw our car, she looked hesitant, almost anxious,and left right after. It felt like she didn&#39;t want to be misunderstood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William remained silent, slowly turning the glass in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca, having worked with him for years, felt comfortable enough to speak plainly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, sir, I don&#39;t believe she&#39;s the kind of woman you perceive her to be. She&#39;s always been composed and respectful in everything she does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, there had been that awkward moment at the bar when she ended up on William&#39;s lap-but it was nothing more than a clumsy accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William set his champagne down and rose from the sofa without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca hesitated, unsure what to make of the sudden movement. His next sentence stalled before it could leave his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My attention is needed elsewhere. Inform me of our guest&#39;s arrival,&#34; William said coolly, locking eyes with Luca for a brief moment before heading toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca stood still, watching him go, a knot of unease tightening in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was William leaving because of something he&#39;d said?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently slapped his mouth, silently scolding himself.He wasn&#39;t usually this talkative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the thought of Stella missing out on such an important opportunity had pushed him to speak up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As William exited the lounge, he caught sight of someone running across the far end of the corridor near the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowed, eyebrows drawing together. The figure,dressed in white, stirred a flicker of recognition in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without meaning to, his mind conjured the shape of Stella&#39;s form-graceful,unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He parted his lips, ready to call out to her,but before he could speak, she darted through the stairwell door and vanished from view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it wasn&#39;t her at all.</p>
