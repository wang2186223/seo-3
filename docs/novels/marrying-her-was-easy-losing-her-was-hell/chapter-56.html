                <p>Haley stared at Stella with visible contempt, as though she hadn&#39;t been the one pleading moments ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella remained silent, allowing Haley to unleash her fury uninterrupted. Once the outburst ended, she spoke in a steady tone. &#34;You call me disgraceful, but what about your own behavior?Public misconduct, knowingly becoming someone&#39;s mistress, and doing it all with pride-this is what passes for aristocratic grace in Achury? What an inspiring example of moral decay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley opened her mouth but couldn&#39;t form a response. Instead, she stamped her foot in irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered,Stella went on. &#34;You say my patent is worthless, yet the Walsh Group&#39;s success over the years would suggest otherwise. Should</p>
                
                
                
                <p>we talk about those flawed contracts of yours?Or maybe look at the patent agreements that clearly outline the monthly fees owed? Take a closer look and see whether Walsh Group&#39;s actually paid me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Living off someone else&#39;s work while pretending to be righteous, what a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley clenched her jaw, unwilling to back down.&#34;You keep saying someone signed your patent deal, then prove it. Where&#39;s the contract? Aren&#39;t you always going on about having evidence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certain Stella had nothing to show, and that belief fueled her boldness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead, bring it out. I want to see who dares challenge the Walsh family!&#34; Beatrice had come to Haley&#39;s side again, standing tall and offering her silent backing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed her full trust in her daughter,not Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By doing so, she made one thing clear: anyone</p>
                
                
                
                <p>bold enough to sign a contract with Stella wasn&#39;t just opposing the Walsh family, they were going up against the elite circles of Achury as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The confrontation dragged on, and the crowd buzzed with anticipation, waiting to see whether Stella could actually produce the agreement she claimed to have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the contract had been finalized at the research institute, and Lainey was the one holding the document. Stella didn&#39;t have it with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she reached for her phone to ask Lainey to send a copy, a voice rang out from beyond the crowd. &#34;I&#39;m the one who signed her patent.Is there an issue with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush fell over the gathering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads turned instantly, and the crowd stepped aside to make way. William appeared, walking in with confident strides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just a mysterious figure behind the research institute, but also a powerful businessman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Stella was caught off guard by his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Lainey had arranged a new partnership for her, but she hadn&#39;t imagined that her new employer was William himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William spotted Stella standing by herself,facing a small crowd of hostile faces, and walked directly toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Positioning himself beside her, he turned toward Haley and Marc, his voice sharp and cold. &#34;I&#39;m the one who signed the contract. Does anyone here have a problem with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s influence far outshone that of the Walsh family. The fact that he had acquired Stella&#39;s patent proved it held real value, contrary to everything Haley had claimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After years of working with the Walsh Group,Ms. Russell hasn&#39;t received a single payment.But let me make this clear,&#34; William said,directing his words to the room, &#34;I run a principled company. You&#39;ll be paid every cent you&#39;re owed, Ms. Russell. And my legal team will assist you in recovering everything you&#39;re entitled to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s behavior of living off Stella&#39;s work without compensation was, in William&#39;s eyes,pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back to her, William gave Stella a warm smile, his expression calm but filled with assurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella inhaled sharply. She&#39;d never seen him look at her like that before. Her eyes fluttered,uncertain if what she saw was real-or if her mind was playing tricks on her.</p>
