                <p>Facing a banquet hall full of unfamiliar faces,Stella stood poised and unflinching. Her gaze swept across the crowd at an even pace, her lips curved in a polite smile as she nodded to those who met her eyes. Every inch of her radiated quiet confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood tall and unhurried, allowing others to take her in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, she&#39;d played the part of Marc Walsh&#39;s wife-a life of dinner parties and social niceties replaced with domestic routines. She&#39;d wondered if those years had dulled her ability to navigate a room like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment she walked in, she realized she hadn&#39;t lost her touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no anxiety, no hesitation. Just a calm, grounded certainty that she belonged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That she would shine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before coming, she had done her homework on the SummitRise Group and the man at the center of it all-Steven Harrison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Young, accomplished, and rarely seen on home soil after years abroad. It didn&#39;t take long to spot him. Even in this sea of designer suits and polite ambition, he stood out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glass of champagne in hand, Stella made her way to him, heels clicking softly across the marble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Harrison,&#34; she greeted with a soft but steady voice. &#34;I&#39;m Stella, representing Nebula.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven had already noticed her when she entered, but now that she introduced herself,his brow arched. &#34;&#39;Nebula&#39;? And which Nebula would that be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The company was new-still carving out its place-so the question didn&#39;t surprise her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, she offered him a composed smile and calmly pitched the company. &#34;Nebula is a promising young</p>
                
                
                
                <p>company, Mr. Harrison. And if you give us a chance to collaborate, I&#39;m confident we&#39;ll exceed your expectations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swirled the wine in his glass, amused.&#34;Everyone here represents a company. What makes you think you&#39;ll do better than the rest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand the competition,&#34; Stella said calmly. &#34;But I&#39;ve studied your project specs,your company&#39;s vision, and your needs for this particular collaboration. They align seamlessly with what we offer. If you give us the chance, I&#39;m confident our first proposal will meet your expectations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven gave her a slow, intrigued look.&#34;That&#39;s quite a claim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting his expectations with the first proposal wasn&#39;t going to be easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a small smile. &#34;I have great confidence in our company&#39;s professional capabilities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Steven felt the need to ground her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re young, Ms. Russell. It&#39;s good to be bold. But overconfidence tends to lead to a harder fall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;Confidence backed by ability isn&#39;t arrogance. Let me put it this way:if our proposal doesn&#39;t pass, Nebula will compensate SummitRise financially. No strings, no second chances. And we&#39;ll also provide global-grade technical support.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air between them shifted. Steven&#39;s glass stopped mid-swish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at her for a moment, surprised. No one in the room had made that kind of offer -especially not from a startup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The financial compensation would be huge,and she was offering it if the proposal failed,without even needing a second chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He met her gaze again, this time more seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t bluffing. Her eyes held no trace of doubt. Just clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, Steven nodded. &#34;Since you&#39;re that confident, I&#39;ll give you the opportunity, Ms. Russell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s smile deepened. &#34;Thank you. I promise-you won&#39;t be disappointed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven studied her quietly for a moment longer, a spark of genuine admiration in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder William had sent her. She wasn&#39;t just beautiful-she was sharp, articulate, and bold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her negotiation style was nothing short of elegant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was... interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could see why she had William&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they continued talking, a voice interrupted them from the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Harrison.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s eyes flickered. She turned her head</p>
                
                
                
                <p>slowly, unsurprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc And Haley. She knew this moment would come eventually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that she was back, crossing paths with Marc was inevitable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But seeing him now... it felt distant. Hollow.They were nothing more than strangers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc and Haley stood together in matching attire-Haley clinging to Marc&#39;s arm like a prized accessory. &#34;Mr. Harrison, long time no see,&#34; she said sweetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc offered a practiced smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Six months ago, Haley had used her connections in Achury to help bail out the Walsh Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with SummitRise launching a new energy project, Walsh Group was eager to get a foot in the door. Haley&#39;s familiarity with Steven had been their entry point-and she was making full use of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven gave a slight nod of</p>
                
                
                
                <p>acknowledgment. &#34;Ms. Smith. And this is...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley smiled. &#34;This is Marc Walsh, CEO of Walsh Group in Choria.He heard about your bid and camne to take a look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc was just about to introduce himself-lay out his pitch-when his eyes fell on the woman beside Steven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silver gown. Slender frame. That face.Marc froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Marc&#39;s mind short-circuited -business, Haley, everything just disappeared. He rushed forward, grabbing Stella&#39;s hand like a drowning man clinging to driftwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stel... it&#39;s really you.&#34; His voice cracked with disbelief. &#34;I knew it. I knew you weren&#39;t dead.You&#39;ve forgiven me, right? That&#39;s why you&#39;re here...right?&#34;</p>
