                <p>Marc felt a wave of panic surge through him the moment Stella brought up divorce again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, I know you&#39;re upset today,&#34; he said,trying to sound calm. &#34;Let&#39;s talk when we get home, alright? Whatever apology you want, I&#39;ll give it to you. Just... come here. Don&#39;t make a scene.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella let out a cold laugh. He thought she was just being dramatic?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc glanced at William. &#34;Mr. Briggs, regardless of what happened, you signed my wife&#39;s patent.I&#39;m genuinely happy for her. Thank you for recognizing her talent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He emphasized &#34;my wife&#34; deliberately-staking his claim in front of William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a move meant to intimidate, to mark his territory. As long as the divorce wasn&#39;t finalized,he still had that hold over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley, standing just behind him, nearly combusted on the spot. Her face twisted in fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William watched it all, amused. &#34;Mr. Walsh,perhaps you should focus on calming your mistress. She looks ready to blow. As for Ms.Russell&#39;s patent-her work speaks for itself.It&#39;s got nothing to do with you. So there&#39;s no credit for you to take.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William wasn&#39;t usually this talkative and Stella felt moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like justice-to finally have someone on her side who saw through Marc&#39;s performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time she confronted Marc, he twisted it into some petty tantrum, some jealous outburst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, with William exposing him in front of a crowd, Stella felt a deep sense of vindication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s face darkened. The charity event had gone up in flames for him. And worse, Stella wasn&#39;t on his side anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was staring at him now-stone-faced,unmoved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc stared at Stella&#39;s unwavering expression,his anger overshadowed by panic. His fingers trembled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want to lose her. He couldn&#39;t lose her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Divorce? Absolutely not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gripped by desperation, he reached out to grab her hand again, thinking maybe-just maybe-he could reel her back in. But before Stella could even move, William stepped in and blocked him without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc froze. Stella looked at his pitiful, wounded expression-and felt absolutely nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been through too much with him-and Haley. Whatever pain he was in now didn&#39;t even</p>
                
                
                
                <p>scratch the surtace of what she u enuuicu.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc opened his mouth to say something when -WEE-OOO. The sound of police sirens sliced through the banquet hall. Moments later, a team of officers walked in, their expressions hard and professional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them read from a file, &#34;We received a report of kidnapping and assault. Haley Smith,Marc Walsh, and Jazlyn Walsh-please come with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s mouth dropped open. Stella had really called the police?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned pale, grabbing her mother&#39;s hand in a panic. &#34;Mom, I don&#39;t want to go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice was stunned. But she didn&#39;t believe her daughter had committed such a crime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, snapping to action, she turned to the officers. &#34;This must be a mistake. My daughter hasn&#39;t done anything wrong! You can&#39;t just arrest someone over an accusation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the officer was firm. &#34;We&#39;ll sort that out at the station, ma&#39;am. Please don&#39;t interfere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice&#39;s heart dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in Achury, she could&#39;ve shut this down with a single call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this was Choria-her name meant nothing here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d only come because Haley insisted, and now she was standing helpless as her daughter was about to be taken away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley clung tightly to her mother&#39;s hand,pleading with her eyes. But the officers were already moving in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One stepped forward with handcuffs. His voice was flat. &#34;Ms. Smith, please come with us.&#34;</p>
