                <p>Marc&#39;s voice was hoarse, frantic. &#34;Where the hell is Stella?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey looked like she&#39;d just about had it with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was sharp, eyes blazing. &#34;I told you already-| don&#39;t know. You saw our last messages. She didn&#39;t even reply. What do you want from me? You&#39;re the one who wrecked everything. And now you suddenly care?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scoffed, folding her arms. &#34;You should&#39;ve thought about this before you tore her apart. Don&#39;t show up now acting like some tragic lover. It&#39;s pathetic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was genuinely fed up with Marc&#39;s theatrics. Marc&#39;s belated affection was as worthless as stale news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc wasn&#39;t listening. His eyes were bloodshot, fingers clenched into fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two people came to my house this morning claiming to be police. They handed me a death certificate. Said it was Stella&#39;s.&#34; His voice cracked. &#34;I don&#39;t believe it. I can&#39;t believe it. This is your research institute&#39;s doing, isn&#39;t it? Some trick-just to keep me away from her.&#34; He jabbed a finger at her,trembling with fury. &#34;Don&#39;t even try to deny it. I&#39;m not going anywhere until you tell me where she is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been taking things easy with Lainey,and this was why they were messing with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey froze. &#34;A death certificate?&#34; she repeated,eyes narrowing in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc watched her like a hawk. She looked...genuinely surprised. Not the reaction of someone in on some twisted scheme. His heart sank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she really not know? She was one of Stella&#39;s closest friends, yet she didn&#39;t know about this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be true?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop pretending. Don&#39;t you really know?&#34;Marc tried to keep his calm, his voice trembling as he pressed on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s eyes widened, filled with a mix of panic and disbelief. &#34;How would I know?Stella&#39;s dead? She&#39;s really dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s eyes were wide with panic, but deep inside,her mind was racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The institute did issue death certificates for members of classified projects-it was protocol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant... Stella had joined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was what she&#39;d been hiding. A strange mix of relief and pride washed over her-Stella had finally gotten what she wanted, and as a bonus, ditched Marc in the process.Perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, she had to keep up the act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked hard and forced a few tears to well up. She grabbed her purse and hurled it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you come here accusing me?!&#34;she screamed. &#34;Why is she dead, Marc?Huh? That&#39;s on you! You killed her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mar. wasn&#39;t buying it. He dodged Lainey&#39;s outburst, face like stone, voice low but unrelenting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was it William? Did he take her away?&#34; He kept asking, again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the only thing that made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why else had Stella vanished without a trace? William-cold, calculated, powerful.Of course he&#39;d be the one to help her disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey flinched slightly. His guess was scarily accurate. But she held her ground, masking her surprise with a cracked, tearful expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you insane? You&#39;re accusing her of running off with someone right after hearing she&#39;s dead?! Do you even hear yourself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You&#39;ve got no shame!&#34; She shoved his shoulder hard. &#34;Get out! Just get out-l never want to see your face again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Covering her face, she stormed back to her dorm, sobbing loud enough for the entire hallway to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc stood there for a beat, torn between chasing after her and screaming into the sky.But just then, his phone rang. It was Kody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Walsh, you need to get back to the office. Fast. A bunch of investors just pulled out-we&#39;re barely hanging on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kody&#39;s tone was urgent. Marc&#39;s expression turned grim, jaw locked as he stared down at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now... the company couldn&#39;t afford to collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what it took, he was going to get to the bottom of Stella&#39;s disappearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he ended the call,then turned and headed straight back to the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in a completely different world,Stella was living a full, focused life inside the confidential project group. Every day was packed. Some tasks were challenging,but the team was sharp-they solved problems fast and moved forward even faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc? He hadn&#39;t crossed her mind much lately. But if she had to guess, she figured his life was only spiraling deeper into chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with the prep work nearly complete, the team was gearing up to enter the formal research phase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant round-the-clock commitment.No distractions. No outside noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting in her chair that afternoon, Stella leaned back and let out a long breath. She didn&#39;t want to just bury her past-she wanted to rebuild herself fromn scratch.When this was all over, she hoped she&#39;d emerge as someone entirely new. Someone better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Six months passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella now sat on a plane bound for Choria,lost in thoughts as the skyline slowly came into view through the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William sat beside her. He noticed the quiet tension in her face and asked softly, &#34;Have you decided what you&#39;ll do now that you&#39;re back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The project had been a huge success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As part of their confidentiality agreement,every member had the option to either take up their old identity-or disappear into a new one forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing his question, Stella gave a faint smile.&#34;Stella died six months ago,&#34; she said calmly. &#34;There&#39;s no reason to go back to a name that doesn&#39;t mean anything anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William glanced over at her, a flicker of something like admiration passing through his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re interested,&#34; he said, &#34;I could offer</p>
                
                
                
                <p>you a position at Briggs Group. Technical Director.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella blinked, genuinely caught off guard.Six months ago, this man had been ice cold and completely dismissive of her skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now he was offering her a high-ranking role?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to him, her smile laced with playful sarcasm. &#34;Mr. Briggs, are you finally admitting I&#39;m good at what| do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, thei dynamic had shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had once been formal was now relaxed -friendly,even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes sparkled with playful mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William chuckled under his breath, eyes glinting. &#34;Let&#39;s just say... you passed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Passed? That was it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella opened her mouth to ask more, but before she could say anything, a cold voice cut in from a few seats over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I were you, Ms. Russell,&#34; Nathalia said sharply, &#34;I&#39;d have a little more self-awareness. The Briggs Group doesn&#39;t hire people through backdoor connections. They hire based on merit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathalia had spent the last six months circling William like a hawk-doing everything in her power to earn his attention. But William had been polite at best, indifferent at worst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her qualifications, he hadn&#39;t once offered her a position in his company. And now here he was-extending a job offer to Stella of all people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was it about Stella?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella turned toward her with a raised brow,unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Stella had assumed Nathalia was just another unfortunate soul. But as time went on, it became clear-this had always been one-sided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was naturally distant. He kept people</p>
                
                
                
                <p>at arm&#39;s length, always cool, aiways composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Nathalia? She was just another name on the list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella actually felt a little sorry for her.Because William liked men. And Nathalia, no matter how hard she tried, was chasing a ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella didn&#39;t feel angry-just amused. She turned, smiled sweetly at Nathalia, and said with that disarming calm, &#34;You&#39;re absolutely right, Ms. Fuller. I&#39;m not good enough.You&#39;re the best match. The perfect match,really.&#34;Then she tilted her head, almost thoughtfully. &#34;Oh! I just remembered-I need to check something with Maia. I&#39;ll let you two...bond.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, she stood and walked away,settling into the seat beside Maia, giving the two space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s gaze followed her the whole way.His expression darkened by the second</p>
