                <p>Think You&#39;re That Import...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence fell over the room as everyone stared at Stella and Haley, shocked by what they had just heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though most of the staff didn&#39;t care much for Haley,they knew better than to cross her. She held an influential position, and even Marc treated her with care. For Stella to tell her to leave the company like that? It sounded impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The employees glanced at one another, utterly lost,while Haley, overwhelmed by humiliation, snatched a cup from the desk and hurled it to the floor with a loud crash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who do you think you are, Stella?&#34; Haley snapped.&#34;It&#39;s just a damn patent! You think this entire company revolves around you? Well, guess what? I&#39;m not going anywhere! Sign the contract or don&#39;t, I really don&#39;t give a fuck. But me, walking away? Keep dreaming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Theo nearly lost his composure. Just one damn patent? Did Haley even know what she was talking about? Stella&#39;s patent brought in massive revenue</p>
                
                
                
                <p>every year. The entire company practically stood on it.If she walked away, everything could crumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Haley, blinded by rage, couldn&#39;t see past her bruised ego and even dared to tell Stella to get lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Stella had no interest in arguing anymore.Without a word, she turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she neared the door, Theo, realizing they had crossed a line that couldn&#39;t be taken back, hurried after her. &#34;Mrs. Walsh, allow me to walk you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear this whole mess was the company&#39;s doing,and no one could fault Stella for walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before she stepped into the elevator, Theo hesitated, then spoke. &#34;Mrs. Walsh, if you don&#39;t mind me saying...would you consider having a word with Mr.Walsh? Haley clearly isn&#39;t fit for this role. Keeping her around will only create more problems.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what, Stella was still Marc&#39;s wife, and anything she said would carry far more weight than what the employees could express.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And besides, it wasn&#39;t exactly a secret-everyone could tell MMarc still had feelings for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella gave a faint press of her lips but stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving, she made her way to Allegra&#39;s desk for a quick goodbye. &#34;Choria&#39;s a big city, Allegra,&#34; she said calmly. &#34;There&#39;s no shortage of companies here that would value someone like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allegra was clever. She knew exactly what Stella was hinting at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Marc&#39;s firm wasn&#39;t the only place worth working at-Choria was full of opportunities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allegra&#39;s eyes brightened, and a knowing smile passed between them. As Stella stepped into the elevator,Allegra called out warmly, &#34;Take care, Mrs. Walsh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Stella walked outside, the sun had disappeared behind thick clouds. It had been bright and sunny when she came in, but now the sky looked heavy and gray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a quiet sigh, thinking it might start raining soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing by the roadside, watching cars rush past,she quietly reminded herself, &#34;Just five more days, Stella.&#34;Only five more. Then all of this would finally be behind her, gone in the blink of an eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,back at the company, Haley wasted no time storming into Marc&#39;s office,unloading everything</p>
                
                
                
                <p>that had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marc, you should&#39;ve seen her! She was completely out of line. I was only doing what you told me-trying to get her to renew the deal, and she turned around and told me to get lost!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc was just wrapping up a meeting when Haley started venting. He looked mildly annoyed but kept his expression composed. He then reached out and gently patted her back in an attempt to calm her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, don&#39;t get too worked up. I understand you&#39;re angry,&#34; he said softly. &#34;Why don&#39;t I take you to your favorite place for dinner tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Haley felt a little less angry, but she still wasn&#39;t ready to let it go. Pouting, she clung to his arm and said, &#34;No. I want Stella to kneel and apologize to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her body against his, making sure he felt every curve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc didn&#39;t push her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He simply brushed her hair back with deliberate gentleness, like he was indulging her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just when she thought he&#39;d cave to her whims,his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>next words came like a slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really think you&#39;re that important?&#34; he said, his tone chillingly indifferent.</p>
