                <p>Stella didn&#39;t even dare to glance at William.She instantly scooted away to put space between them-and that was when her hair snagged on his belt buckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp tug made her wince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shifted again, trying to free herself... but it just made things worse. Now it looked like she was doing it on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>God, no. Absolutely not intentional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of pushing her away like last time,William just glanced down and said calmly,&#34;Don&#39;t move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he leaned forward and gently untangled her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella scrambled back the second she was free,face burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clutched her shirt closed and backed away until there was a very proper, very professional gap between them. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry, Mr. Briggs! I didn&#39;t mean it at all-the car turned suddenly,and I just... lost my balance. I swear I have no improper intentions toward you whatsoever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked so serious one would think she was taking an oath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William raised an eyebrow, clearly amused by her dramatic sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Stella took that look the wrong way. She thought he didn&#39;t believe her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed to add, &#34;If I did have any improper thoughts about you, then may I get hit by a car the moment I step outside!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Luca, up front, flinched at that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella was clearly pulling out all the stops just to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>clear the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s lips twitched. &#34;No need for such a dramatic curse. I&#39;m not blind. I saw what happened-it was the turn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella muttered under her breath, &#34;Well, you were basically blind last time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t been like this last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought she&#39;d said it quietly enough. She hadn&#39;t. The entire car went silent-awkwardly so. William heard it. Luca definitely heard it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca cringed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s voice came, low and unreadable.&#34;Where&#39;d that come from?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella knew she&#39;d messed up the second he asked. Her mouth had run faster than her brain -again. Now there was no rewinding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she couldn&#39;t walk it back, she figured she might as well be honest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They saw each other at the institute nearly every day. She couldn&#39;t keep walking on eggshells around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath, sat up straighter,and looked him in the eye. &#34;Mr. Briggs, I just feel like... you&#39;ve got a bit of a bias against me.It makes things really difficult whenever you&#39;re around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William held her gaze, the corners of his mouth lifting ever so slightly. &#34;When have I ever made things difficult for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So first she&#39;d called him blind. Now she was accusing him of being her source of anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bold. But that little flash of courage quickly fizzled out when she met his cool, unreadable eyes.He was far too calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella instantly shrunk back, eyes darting toward the window. &#34;Forget I said anything,Mr.Briggs. Just... pretend I was rambling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed herself against the car door like</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the window might let her escape. No way she was risking another accidental brush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William watched her for a beat,something close to a smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella really was more interesting than he&#39;d expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, casually, he said, &#34;Ms. Russell, you took my measurements earlier. So the suit should fit perfectly this time, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice had the faintest teasing edge to it.Stella blinked. Wait, what? Hadn&#39;t he told her not to waste her time on &#34;trivial&#34; things like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he changing his mind now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he expecting another suit-equal value,custom-fitted?</p>
