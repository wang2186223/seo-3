                <p>This was Sleka. Here, gossip about Choria barely made it past a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s expression twisted. &#34;What nonsense are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella gave a calm, deliberate smile.&#34;I found out that Ms. Russell once reported you and Marc to the police. Not just for cheating behind her back,but for stealing her patent, too. Pretty sure there&#39;s still a record of it sitting at the station.lt caused quite a stir back then. Funny how you walked out of it all without a scratch. I&#39;m guessing your family had to pull some serious strings, huh?And now, here you are, still obsessing over a woman who&#39;s been gone for ages. What&#39;s your real angle,Ms. Smith?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd started whispering. And it wasn&#39;t in Haley&#39;s favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t she that wealthy heiress from Achury?What&#39;s she doing here playing the mistress? Her family must be mortified.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rich? Please. Ever hear the saying &#39;the apple</p>
                
                
                
                <p>doesn&#39;t fall far from the tree&#39;? Maybe her mom wasn&#39;t much better-how else would she end up like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Poor Stella. Who knows, maybe she was killed by Haley and that dirtbag husband of hers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley and Beatrice could hear every word. The sneers, the judgment-it all hit like a slap in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley snapped, her voice shrill. &#34;Stella, stop making up lies! You just can&#39;t stand that Marc&#39;s moved on. He doesn&#39;t love you anymore! You were the one clinging to him! You disappeared for six months hoping he&#39;d chase after you-and when he didn&#39;t, you crawled back with a new name,hoping to win him over again. Pathetic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;l say this one last time,&#34; Stella said, voice steady and cold. &#34;My name is Sylvia Gilbert,not Stella Russell.&#34; Her expression darkened. &#34;Ms.Smith, not everyone settles for scraps like you do.Maybe Marc&#39;s a prize in your eyes, but to the rest of us? He&#39;s trash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had let go of her feelings for Marc a long time ago. In fact, looking back, she regretted ever wasting years on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All those empty promises-she&#39;d been blind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, who are you calling trash?!&#34; Haley couldn&#39;t take it. The moment she heard someone insult Marc-especially Stella-she lost it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lunged at her, hand raised to slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Stella wasn&#39;t about to just stand there and let it happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smoothly dodged, stepping aside just as Haley came swinging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Problem was, Haley was in stilettos-heels at least ten centimeters high-and after missing her mark, she stumbled hard, landing flat on the floor in the most awkward, ridiculous way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face contorted into a half-shocked, half-pained grimace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People around them covered their mouths,bursting into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice&#39;s face turned stone-cold. She&#39;d come to this event hoping to land a deal with the Vance family, but they hadn&#39;t even gotten to the negotiation table and were already a walking joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the lounge nearby, Saul was seated at a chessboard, deep in thought. He moved a pawn</p>
                
                
                
                <p>with a focused hand, totally absorbed in the game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was his birthday today, and he&#39;d finally found a chess partner worth playing with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from him, William glanced over at the surveillance monitor set up in the corner of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen showed a clear feed of the banquet hall-right in time to catch Haley&#39;s fall in front of Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smirked, clearly entertained. Stella had really come a long way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning his attention back to the game, he chuckled softly. &#34;Your game&#39;s gotten better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saul beamed at the compliment. &#34;Been practicing ever since our last match.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William made his next move, sliding a knight into position, blocking Saul&#39;s bishop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke casually, eyes still on the board. &#34;Saul, if I&#39;m not mistaken... Haley and Beatrice-aren&#39;t they your relatives?&#34; His tone was light, almost amused, as he waited for Saul&#39;s next move.</p>
