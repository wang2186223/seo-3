                <p>&#34;Careful!&#34; A firm voice called out from behind, and before Stella could react, a hand reached out and steadied her just in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart skipped a beat as she turned to see William standing there, his hand still loosely holding hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; she murmured softly, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she regained her balance, William let go without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the rest of the group caught up,their eyes lighting up as they spotted the plant tucked in the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With William&#39;s brief assistance, Stella managed to carefully collect the plant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finally! We&#39;ve found it!&#34; someone exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere lifted instantly, and any earlier doubts about Stella faded away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One colleague walked up to her with a grin.&#34;Stella, you&#39;re incredible! I can&#39;t believe you actually found it here by the river!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella was just about to explain that it was simply a coincidence when a cold, mocking laugh suddenly rang out from the back of the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to find none other than Nathalia Fuller standing behind the group, with her arms crossed and eyes full of disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella hadn&#39;t even realized Nathalia had tagged along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With icy sarcasm, Nathalia sneered. &#34;Ms.Russell, we&#39;re here to work, not to watch you throw yourself at men. That fall of yours-you planned it, didn&#39;t you? Just so William would catch you. Honestly, your behavior is downright shameless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The accusation hit Stella like a slap. For a moment, she was stunned, completely</p>
                
                
                
                <p>caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was Nathalia even talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the team exchanged confused glances, no one quite understanding where Nathalia&#39;s anger was coming from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathalia pushed her way through the crowd and stopped right in front of Stella. Her eyes narrowed as she looked at the plant in Stella&#39;s hand. &#34;William must&#39;ve told you the location, didn&#39;t he? He&#39;s the most experienced here. Let&#39;s not pretend you found this on your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella had no idea why Nathalia was so riled up, but she knew there was something complicated between her and William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But who was chasing whom? From the look of it, Nathalia seemed to care more than William did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe seeing him help Stella had stirred some jealousy. Whatever it was, it clearly burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Stella was at a loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella was honestly at a loss for words. First,she&#39;d been wrongly accused by Haley before even joining the project team, and now she was being dragged through the mud by William&#39;s so-called unattainable ideal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she had been too quiet, too tolerant all this time-so much so that people thought they could walk all over her without consequence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Stella handed the plant to a colleague and stepped up to Nathalia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Fuller, I don&#39;t know what kind of grudge you have against me, but let me make a few things clear. First, I found this spot on my own-it had nothing to do with Mr. Briggs. Second, I didn&#39;t fake that fall. The path is slippery. You were all a good fifteen feet behind me when it happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella hadn&#39;t thought William would catch up to her so quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she were really trying to pull some stunt,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she would&#39;ve waited until he was right behind her. Doing it earlier would&#39;ve been too risky-it made no sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squared her shoulders and then added,&#34;I came here to work, and I take this seriously. And if Mr. Briggs really knew the location all along, are you suggesting he just stood by and let everyone wander aimlessly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That shut Nathalia up right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she pushed her argument any further,it would mean accusing William of deliberately watching everyone struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no comeback, Nathalia could only shoot daggers at Stella with furious eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella quickly looked at William, thinking he might be upset that she spoke up, especially since Nathalia seemed important to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to her surprise, he didn&#39;t look annoyed at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed composed and unbothered,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ignoring Nathalia entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd stayed quiet, their eyes bouncing between the three of them, too nervous to say a word.</p>
