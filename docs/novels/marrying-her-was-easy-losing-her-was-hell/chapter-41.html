                <p>William couldn&#39;t say for certain if the woman he saw was Stella, but the image of her on his lap that night,paired with her recent avoidance, lingered stubbornly in his thoughts. Brows drawn tight, he pulled out his phone and fired off a message to Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find out if Stella&#39;s at the Voyage Hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella burst from the elevator in a daze, her steps unsteady and frantic. The only exit nearby was the emergency stairwell, and without thinking twice,she pushed it open and slipped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t realize until it was too late, she was already on the ground floor, and the stairwell offered no exit except upwards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had only managed to climb a few steps when the sound of footsteps echoed from above, fast and heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lifted. More men were coming down, dressed like the one who had attacked her earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth struck her instantly, she&#39;d been herded</p>
                
                
                
                <p>straight into a trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spun around, desperate to escape,but the first man had already slipped inside behind her. His expression was twisted with cruel intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her knees buckled, and she fell onto the cold steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please... I&#39;ll give you anything you want... just let me go...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words barely made it out before a cloth was stuffed into her mouth. She was forced upright, and hauled up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella whimpered softly, her vision blurring as tears filled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even before the drug, she would&#39;ve struggled to resist their strength, now, her body felt like it no longer belonged to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts were intact, but her limbs refused to respond. She couldn&#39;t stop them from dragging her into a hotel room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quit fighting. We&#39;re not here to harm you,we just need a few dirty pictures.&#34; One of the men shoved her farther into the dimly lit room, his voice low and careless as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word &#34;pictures&#34; rang in Stella&#39;s ears, sharp and jarring.Pictures? What type of pictures...?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could gather her thoughts, they forced her onto the bed. Hands clawed at her clothing,tugging with brutal urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of cold air from the open window brushed over her skin, and she began to shake uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It clicked in an instant-she finally understood the kind of pictures they meant to take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who asked you to do this?&#34; She had no clue who had paid these men, but the way they operated made one thing clear: they were in it for the money. Pushed to the edge of the bed, she edged backward, forcing herself to stay composed. &#34;I have money. Whatever deal they made with you-I&#39;ll match it and add more!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them scoffed at the offer. &#34;Don&#39;t bother.This&#39;ll be over soon if you stop fighting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were just carrying out instructions and had no interest in dragging things out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Backed into the corner of the mattress, Stella braced herself as they closed in. Her fists clenched so tightly her nails dug into her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fought to keep her breathing steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re doing someone&#39;s dirty work, I get it, but do you even understand this is a crime? Sooner or later,you&#39;ll be arrested. I&#39;ll report everything,and none of you will walk away clean. Or...&#34; she paused,her voice steadying, &#34;you take the money now, walk out that door, and I never mention this again. Think it over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the men tilted his head, intrigued.He looked like he was about to say something. Then the door creaked open behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley stepped into the room, a black plastic bag dangling from her hand and a cruel smirk tugging at her lips. &#34;Don&#39;t waste your energy,&#34; she said coldly.&#34;There&#39;s no way out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dropped the bag onto the floor with a thud and strolled forward without hurry. &#34;Since we&#39;re going to stage something like this, it better look real. People care about that now-believability,&#34; she added with a mocking tone. &#34;These are your props. Use them however you want. And don&#39;t bother with condoms.&#34;</p>
