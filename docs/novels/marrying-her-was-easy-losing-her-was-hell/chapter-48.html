                <p>Jazlyn froze for a beat, caught off guard by Marc&#39;s cold tone. He had just dismissed her-publicly. Her face darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a tense pause, she huffed. &#34;Look at you,Marc. Still defending that woman? She&#39;s been cheating on you! Haley is the one who actually deserves you. Divorce Stella already and be with someone who truly matches your status.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Marc could react, Jazlyn took Haley&#39;s hand and placed it firmly into his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley,ever the opportunist, clutched his hand quickly and beamed at Jazlyn. &#34;Don&#39;t worry,Jazlyn. I&#39;ll take good care of Marc.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc didn&#39;t say a word-he couldn&#39;t. His brain froze at the word cheating. What were they even talking about? Stella? Unfaithful?Impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been with Stella for years. Through thick and thin. She wasn&#39;t perfect, but her integrity?That had never once wavered. Yes, she&#39;d been in contact with William lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Marc trusted her. He always had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze snapped to Jazlyn. &#34;Mom, what are you really doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn&#39;s smile thinned, her patience worn. But she wasn&#39;t about to back down now-not when the finish line was so close. From her bag, she pulled out a folded document Haley had handed her earlier. &#34;I told you. I&#39;ve seen the photos,Marc. They&#39;re disgusting! And you&#39;re still defending her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She handed him the contract. &#34;Here. Look at this-Stella signed it herself. The same contract she refused to touch before. Why do you think she agreed so easily now? She&#39;s guilty, Marc.She&#39;s trying to clean up her mess quietly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc stared at the document in his hands, a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>strange chill crawling up his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the patent renewal-a contract far more ruthless than the one he&#39;d initially drafted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even he thought it was excessive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at the bottom, there it was. Stella&#39;s fingerprint. Clear, crimson and unmistakable.His pulse throbbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked once, twice, as the realization sunk in. She signed this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest tightened. Why would she do that?Why now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was his mother right? Had Stella betrayed him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it William?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The signed contract did nothing to lighten his mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tightened his grip on the paper, the corners curling under the strain. His jaw locked, eyes darkening with something dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around them, the whispers ignited like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some made up their own unpleasant version of the incident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, a smaller group murmured doubts, refusing to believe Stella was what they were painting her to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn and Haley exchanged a subtle glance.The tide was turning. All that was left was the final blow-the photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But minutes passed. Then more. No photos. No alerts. No shocked gasps from guests. Only silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, the grand doors of the hall slowly opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guests turned in unison as Stella stepped into the hall, draped in elegance and quiet power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved like she belonged, like the swirling rumors hadn&#39;t reached her at all-or worse, that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone recognized her instantly. The woman at the heart of tonight&#39;s scandal had just arrived in the flesh. Gasps rippled through the hall like falling dominoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell is going on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she here to defend herself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To reclaim Marc? Speculations buzzed as eyes darted between her and Marc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s reaction was almost instinctive. He stepped away from Haley, as if burned-his face flashing with guilt, confusion, and a hint of panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t expected this. He&#39;d promised her he wouldn&#39;t bring another woman to social events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley and Jazlyn were equally shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s lips parted, but no words came out. She couldn&#39;t believe what she was seeing. After everything she and Jazlyn had done... After</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella had supposedly been ruined... How was she standing here? Poised. Intact. Radiant.Jazlyn, too, was stunned. She had never thought Stella would dare show her face-Not tonight. Not after those photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All three of them-Marc, Haley, and Jazlyn-stared at Stella, their minds racing in different directions, tangled in schemes, panic, and desperate calculations. They wore the same expression-pure,unfiltered shock.</p>
