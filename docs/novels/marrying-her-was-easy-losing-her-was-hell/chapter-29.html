                <p>Stella faltered for a moment, caught off guard by his words. She&#39;d left most of her belongings behind; the only sizable thing she&#39;d carried out of the kitchen was the capsule coffee machine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That machine had been her first big purchase since they&#39;d become a couple, back when money was tight and she&#39;d scraped together several months&#39; pay to afford it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc hardly ever set foot in the kitchen, so she never imagined he&#39;d notice its absence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in her thoughts, she startled at the sound of Marc knocking again. &#34;Stella, open up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she delayed any longer, he&#39;d start to suspect something-and the last thing she wanted was for him to realize other things had quietly vanished too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried to the door and pulled it open, matching his confused expression with a calm, steady gaze.&#34;The coffee machine stopped working, so I brought it out for repairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The machine had been around for years; it wasn&#39;t exactly a stretch for it to finally break down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s shoulders eased, the worry fading from his face as he accepted her explanation without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than letting her go, he caught her arm with a gentle touch. &#34;Stella, I really messed up. Please, just give me another chance. Let me make your favorite meal-come downstairs and have a little with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His easy, charming grin was as familiar as it was calculated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever she showed the slightest irritation, he would head into the kitchen and whip up something himself,pretending to bridge the gap with a homemade dish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She used to find it endearing-this man,who wouldn&#39;t so much as set a plate on the table for anyone else,suddenly rolling up his sleeves just for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she recognized it for what it was: another routine performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had probably used the same trick on others before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her tone calm and unbothered. &#34;I&#39;m not really hungry. I think I&#39;ll skip it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc didn&#39;t lose his smile, still doing everything he could to stay in her good graces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked, &#34;Stella, what happened to that coat you got me a while back? I checked the closet yesterday,but it wasn&#39;t there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella guessed he actually meant the one she&#39;d picked out for William instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every season, his closet overflowed with fresh deliveries; half the time, he couldn&#39;t recall what she&#39;d given him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sudden interest struck her as odd, stirring a flicker of annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I ended up getting the wrong size, so I sent it back,&#34;she answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc looked genuinely taken aback. &#34;Sent it back?Why not just swap it for another one if the fit was off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she&#39;d really meant to buy something for him,he doubted she would&#39;ve returned it at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t examined the coat that day, but the logo on the shopping bag hadn&#39;t escaped his notice-a high-end label, unmistakably expensive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella pressed her lips together, her tone mild. &#34;Lately,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>your whole look has shifted. I wasn&#39;t sure what you&#39;d actually wear. Anyway, it&#39;s not like you&#39;re short on clothes-you&#39;ve got tons already, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc usually gravitated toward understated, classic pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his recent outfits had taken on a splash of color and flash Stella easily traced back to Haley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s taste was as loud as her personality-confident,eye-catching,never subtle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than once, Marc had come home in clothing Stella didn&#39;t recognize. Knowing Marc&#39;s aversion to shopping, she could only guess Haley had been slipping him these gifts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head gently. &#34;But you picked that coat out for me, Stella. Whatever you choose, I&#39;ll always like.&#34; Marc instantly sensed her hidden warning and tried to justify himself, his expression strained with anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella retreated a pace, her tone brisk. &#34;I&#39;m exhausted.I&#39;m turning in for the night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, she swung the door shut, refusing to spare Marc another glance and leaving him alone in the hallway, isolated and unwelcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at her desk, Stella dove into the project files,her attention fixed on the task at hand. Moments later,the rumble of an engine drifted in through the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a quiet, knowing smile, having expected nothing less, and carried on reading without pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to Stella, Marc didn&#39;t drive off immediately. He loitered by the curb for several minutes before sending out a message.&#34;Keep watch on her. I want updates on everything she does.&#34;</p>
