                <p>Even if it didn&#39;t look that way on the surface,Stella truly had no hidden intentions, and she simply didn&#39;t want to owe William anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After slipping the note into the shopping bag,she quietly made her way to William&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The space was spotless, everything lined up perfectly as if untouched by time. She didn&#39;t linger. With a respectful pause, she set the bag on his desk and quietly backed out, making sure not to glance at anything that wasn&#39;t hers to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once outside the office,Stella let out a soft breath. With that task done, she turned her thoughts to the upcoming research project and how she might begin getting more involved.But just as she reached the corridor, her phone buzzed in her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled it out, her brows drawing together when she saw the caller ID.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, she accepted the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Walsh, the patent contract has expired,&#34;said Marc&#39;s assistant, his tone all business,completely detached. &#34;We&#39;ll be sending someone to your villa with the new documents for you to sign.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, Stella had let Marc use her patents without asking for a cent. The contract had always listed a price, but she never collected it.Back then, she believed they were one family,and Marc had said nothing to make her think otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He probably assumed that being married ggave him ownership over everything she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, instead of calling her himself, he had his assistant handle it like she was just another supplier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s grip tightened around the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she was never anything more than a convenient source of free profit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No pay required. Just empty promises she&#39;d swallowed whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need for that. I&#39;m free today anyway, so don&#39;t trouble your people,&#34; she said calmly, then ended the call before the assistant could say anything more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the early days of their marriage, she&#39;d visited Marc&#39;s office often, especially when her inventions needed adjusting. She used to know everyone in the building. Lately, though,she hadn&#39;t stepped foot inside. But even if their marriage was falling apart, she was still his partner. Showing up wasn&#39;t just her right-it was long overdue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella tucked her phone away and took a taxi to the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she walked through the front doors, heads turned. Everyone knew who she was. The receptionist stood up quickly, offering a polite but slightly stunned smile. &#34;Mrs. Walsh!It&#39;s been a while-what brings you in today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella smiled politely, unfazed by the subtle</p>
                
                
                
                <p>nervousness in the girl&#39;s voice. &#34;Just here to sign a contract. Is Marc in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two receptionists exchanged glances. &#34;Mr.Walsh...should be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Stella made her way to the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the doors began to close, she caught a glimpse of the receptionist picking up the phone in a rush, but she didn&#39;t care enough to stop and wonder why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator opened on the top floor-the executive level. Marc&#39;s office was there,along with the legal department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella was planning to head straight to legal when Marc&#39;s assistant, Kody, came rushing around the corner. &#34;Mrs. Walsh! You&#39;re here!&#34; he exclaimed, breathless and jittery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face was tight with unease, though he tried to plaster on a calm smile. The result was painfully awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know where the legal department is,&#34; Stella</p>
                
                
                
                <p>replied coolly, stepping forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kody quickly moved to her side, almost too obviously trying to block her view down the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s office was just a short walk away,separated from the legal wing by a narrow passage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Kody tried to block her line of sight, Stella still managed to catch a glimpse inside Marc&#39;s office, and sure enough,she let out a quiet, sarcastic scoff. Who else could it be but Haley?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where she stood, she could clearly see Haley sitting on the edge of Marc&#39;s desk, leaning in toward him. The two were whispering back and forth, smiling as if no one else existed.</p>
