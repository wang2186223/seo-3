                <p>The chaos in the banquet hall hadn&#39;t died down one bit. Stella stood still, watching as Haley and Jazlyn dragged each other through the mud,spilling almost every dirty secret they&#39;d ever kept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn wasn&#39;t one to go down quietly. The second Haley started throwing accusations,she fired right back-no hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haley, you&#39;ve got some nerve,&#34; she snapped.&#34;You knew my son was married and still chased after him like a lost puppy. Everyone at Walsh Group has seen you throwing yourself at him.And let&#39;s not forget-you hired thugs to kidnap Stella!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s face turned ghost-pale. &#34;Don&#39;t you dare pin that on me! You&#39;re the one who told me to do it. I wvas following your orders!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella listened quietly from the crowvd, her eyes narrowing at Haley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, she&#39;d thought Haley was just another spoiled brat-pampered overseas, loud and entitled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after what she pulled... Stella realized something else entirely. People raised in Achury acted like the laws in Choria didn&#39;t apply to them. They did whatever they wanted and expected to get away with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley had no conscience. She&#39;d done those things without flinching-and she&#39;d absolutely do them again if she got the chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Stella eventually divorced Marc, Haley was someone she&#39;d always need to keep an eye on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Marc, who hadn&#39;t said a word all this while. His expression was dark, like the ground had just shifted beneath him. Good,Stella thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bet he never imagined that while he was busy thinking he had everything under control, the two women closest to him were running their own shady games behind his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a crisp slap to the ego.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing she was losing ground with Jazlyn,Haley suddenly switched gears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With tears in her eyes, she turned toward Stella and rushed over, pushing past Marc and his mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Russell, I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; she said breathlessly. &#34;This is all on me. I was tricked by Marc&#39;s mom. I swear, I never meant to hurt you.Whatever compensation you want-money,anything-just say the word. My family will pay Please...forgive me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The implication was clear-she was admitting Stella had been violated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella let out a soft scoff. &#34;Oh? And how much exactly were you planning to offer me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s face lit up,thinking Stella was willing to settle. &#34;Whatever amount you want! Just name it.My family can afford it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Typical Achury elite. To them, money fixed everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s brow furrowed. Why would Stella even entertain this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he ever denied her money? Why go to Haley of all people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley was still watching Stella with hopeful eyes, desperate for a number-any number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Stella? She was enjoying every second of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more hope Haley showed, the sweeter the fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haley,&#34; Stella said coolly, &#34;not everything in life can be solved by throwing money at it. I don&#39;t want your money. I&#39;m taking the evidence to the police. Let them handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was calm, but her smile was ice-cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s face fell in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her mouth to say something else,but Stella cut her off with another sarcastic smile. &#34;Oh-and by the way. All that effort you put in? It was a waste. Your guys failed. There are no pictures. I just walked away with a few scratches.&#34;</p>
