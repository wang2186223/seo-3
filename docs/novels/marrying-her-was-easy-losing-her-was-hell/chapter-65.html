                <p>Marc had spent the entire night locked up at the police station. He hadn&#39;t even bothered to change clothes before storming over to the institute in a frenzy to find Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too bad for him-the guards at the gate weren&#39;t letting him take a single step past the entrance, leaving him no choice but to shout from outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His shouting got so obnoxious that it finally drew out a man in a tailored suit and sleek glasses, clearly someone important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to see Stella Russell! Get her out here, now!&#34; Marc barked, not caring who he was yelling at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;Stella&#39;s not here. And if you keep this up, I&#39;ll call the police.&#34; His tone was calm but firm, the kind that didn&#39;t invite negotiation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s face twisted in anger, irritated by the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>man&#39;s poise. &#34;Who the hell are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Marc&#39;s unreasonable behavior, the man introduced himself as Paul Hoffman, the director of the institute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella is my employee,&#34; he added. &#34;She submitted a leave request this morning and left. Where she went isn&#39;t my concern-and it&#39;s certainly not yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To prove his point, Paul pulled out Stella&#39;s handwritten leave note and showed it to Marc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc stared at the familiar handwriting,suddenly unsure of himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been so sure she&#39;d still be here-where else could she have gone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul didn&#39;t wait for a response. He turned and walked back inside, casually instructing security to call the police if Marc caused any more trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc flinched. After spending the night in a holding cell, the last thing he wanted was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>another trip back. Now that he knew Stella wasn&#39;t here, he had no choice but to slink away, humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the Maybach, Stella burst into quiet laughter as William explained that Paul had personally handled Marc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image of Marc being tossed out like a stray dog? Utterly satisfying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all his self-righteous posturing,watching him crash and burn was the sweetest kind of justice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William caught the laughter in her eyes and immediately knew-she was thinking about Marc. His gaze darkened, the corners of his mouth tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The project&#39;s demanding,&#34; he said coolly. &#34;If your head&#39;s still stuck on personal drama,maybe it&#39;s better you stay home and play house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s smile vanished as she straightened up. &#34;Mr. Briggs, don&#39;t worry. The moment join the project team, I&#39;m all in. No</p>
                
                
                
                <p>distractions. I&#39;ll be focused-completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was firm, eyes unwavering. She was dead serious. If she&#39;d had to swear on it, she would&#39;ve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having made her decision, she was determined to follow through, leaving the past behind and pursuing a better future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William seemed satisfied. A faint smirk tugged at the corner of his lips as he focused on the road. From Stella&#39;s angle, she caught a glimpse of his sharp jawline-clean, strong like it had been sculpted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hated to admit it, but he really was unfairly good-looking. She used to think Marc was attractive, but now? William made Marc look like a dollar-store knockoff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sudden comparison made her cringe.She quickly shook her head to banish the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They arrived at the project base-a hidden facility tucked into the side of a mountain.William cut the engine and nodded at her to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>get out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath before stepping out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others were already neck deep in work,and since she&#39;d arrived later than the rest,she was directed through the back entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a core team member, her identity was confidential. Regular staff didn&#39;t even know she existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were five core members in total,herself included. She hadn&#39;t met any of them before now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they stood together for the first time,the air was polite but stiff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one really knew each other. No one knew what to expect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once you get to know each other, feel free to choose any dorm,&#34; the team leader addressed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella scanned the group and gave a brief nod to the two other women, but she wasn&#39;t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>picky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bed was a bed-she just chose one and got on with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were expected to dive straight into work. Their first task was to head into the surrounding mountains and collect biological specimens for research.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving, Stella buried herself in the project files, scanning every detail to familiarize herself with the mission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she slung her backpack over her shoulder, ready to head out, the team leader stopped her to inform her she had a partner.&#34;Your partner&#39;s waiting. Men&#39;s dormitory,room 305.&#34;</p>
