                <p>&#34;Haley, what&#39;s wrong with you? How could you even suggest turning Stella in? She&#39;s the woman I married. I&#39;d never do that to her!&#34;Marc&#39;s voice rose with disbelief. The thought of Stella being arrested made him sick, and he knew Haley wasn&#39;t being honest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s eyes welled up with what looked like hurt.&#34;Marc, how can you think I meant it that way? That&#39;s not what I was trying to do. I just thought... if you filed a report anonymously and then stepped in to pull some strings,she&#39;d have no choice but to rely on you. That might bring her back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sounded sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc went quiet, weighing her words. Was that even possible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This might be the only option you have left,&#34;Haley continued softly. &#34;You&#39;re the head of</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the Walsh Group. If you choose not to press charges, nothing will happen to her. She won&#39;t end up in prison. But think about it,she&#39;s made so much progress in just six months. The usual ways won&#39;t reach her anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was true. Halfway into the year she had grown even more impressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had more choices now, and maybe that was why she no longer looked his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what if she had nowhere else to turn? If he helped her... could she really keep walking away from him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Marc&#39;s expression began to shift, Haley recognized that he was thinking about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And while he stood there silently, her eyes gleamed with something sharp and bitter-something he never noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc did have the power to decide whether or not Stella ended up behind bars. But if word got out that she had stolen Walsh Group&#39;s confidential material, her reputation</p>
                
                
                
                <p>would collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There wouldn&#39;t be a single company in all of Choria, or even in Briset, that would take her in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The influential figure backing her now would walk away the moment she lost her usefulness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when that happened, Stella wouldn&#39;t stand a chance against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Briggs Group, Stella followed Luca into William&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca gave a polite nod and quietly stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now only the two remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella looked toward the man behind the desk, focused on the files before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His features were breathtakingly sharp, as if carved from marble. Even after seeing him so many times, she still found herself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>catching different traces of beauty in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was almost unreal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cleared her thoughts and began her update. &#34;SummitRise Group has agreed to work with Nebula. I gave them my word that the proposal would pass in its original form,with no edits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William lifted his head to look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella braced herself, expecting a lecture,maybe something about making risky promises. She thought he might demand that she ensure its approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead, he gave a slow nod and spoke with an unexpected softness. &#34;You&#39;ve done weell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella blinked in surprise. That was it? No criticism? &#34;You&#39;re...not upset?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William let out a low laugh. &#34;Why would I be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But... what if SummitRise ends up rejecting</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the proposal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The payout would be huge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They won&#39;t,&#34; he replied calmly. &#34;You were sure about that before you made the call,weren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was light, almost like he was remarking on something ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella fell silent, caught off guard. She had believed she was the confident one, but clearly, it was William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned slightly. &#34;If that&#39;s all, I&#39;ll return to my desk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There likely wouldn&#39;t be much more for her to do with SummitRise now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William placed his pen aside, opened a drawer, and pulled something out. &#34;Hold on.Take this with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked down and saw a sleek black credit card resting on the desk. It looked like one of those rare global exclusives. &#34;You want me to pick something up for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the only reason she could think of -why else hand her the card?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s lips lifted in a faint smile. &#34;It&#39;s for you. Think of it as an early payment. Buy yourself something you actually like, maybe clothes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She happened to be wearing a dress he had chosen for her that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her figure was graceful and well-proportioned, but she stuck mostly to plain T-shirts and jeans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she had the frame to wear anything well, her outfits always downplayed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella gave him a confused look. &#34;I have plenty of clothes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William raised an eyebrow.&#34;You mean those washed-out outfits you wear to the lab?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were they really that bad?</p>
