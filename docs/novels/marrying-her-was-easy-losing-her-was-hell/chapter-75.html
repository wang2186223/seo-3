                <p>Stella froze, both confused and startled.William wanted to have a meal-shouldn&#39;t Nathalia be the one sitting across from him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Briggs, I don&#39;t think this is appropriate,&#34;she said firmly, standing her ground like she was protecting her moral compass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t argue. Instead, he reached out and gave her forehead a light flick. &#34;When I&#39;m done eating, take the tray with you. I&#39;m not delivering it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he turned and walked inside,leaving the door open behind him like a silent cue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella blinked a few times before the pieces clicked.Oh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t mean he wanted to eat with her-he just didn&#39;t want to make a second trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a breath she hadn&#39;t realized she was holding. Honestly, she&#39;d been overthinking. For a second there, she thought he was being weirdly forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She followed him in and gently shut the door behind her, quietly taking a seat while he moved around the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of starting his meal, William opened a drawer and pulled something out.He handed it over. &#34;Is this yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella looked down and instantly recognized her hair tie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh? Why do you have this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yesterday, she&#39;d had it wrapped around her wrist, but later that night, she found that it had disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She figured she&#39;d lost it somewhere and didn&#39;t bother looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Were you at the corner near the break room yesterday?&#34; William asked casually, setting the tie on the table. &#34;You&#39;re so careless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Can&#39;t even keep track of a hair tie. How old are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was teasing, but it still annoyed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why can&#39;t I go there?&#34; she muttered. &#34;It&#39;s not like there was a sign. How was |supposed to know you were having a secret rendezvous with your first love? I didn&#39;t mean to walk in on it. If you&#39;re gonna do that kind of thing, maybe pick a more discreet spot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed the hair tie and shoved it into her jacket pocket with a huff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, still holding his fork, paused before taking a bite. His brow furrowed at her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What secret rendezvous?&#34; he asked slowly.&#34;What did you see?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella gave him a flat look. Was he seriously pretending he didn&#39;t know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt awkward saying it out loud, but then again-she didn&#39;t do anything wrong, so why should she feel embarrassed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What else could I have seen? You and Nathalia kissing,&#34; she snapped, arms crossed, wearing a stiff, indignant expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William gave a slight nod, then said,completely deadpan, &#34;I don&#39;t like kissing.Don&#39;t even know how to kiss. I&#39;ve never kissed a woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella froze. Her eyes flew wide open. Wait,what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those three simple sentences hit her like a brick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t like kissing? Didn&#39;t know how? And had never kissed a woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brain screeched to a halt. Had she seen it wrong last night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replayed the angle in her head and realized-yeah, maybe she could&#39;ve misunderstood the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But hold on...what did he just say?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t like kissing women? Did that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>mean...he liked kissing men?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella gasped like she&#39;d just uncovered the plot twist of the century, slapping a hand over her mouth in pure shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was it! No wonder he always looked like he&#39;d bitten into something sour every time she got too close-he wasn&#39;t into women at all. He was gay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All her accidental touches? Probably pure torture for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And poor Nathalia... Was she still holding out hope without knowing the truth? Or did she know and just refuse to let go?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As all these ridiculous thoughts tangled in her head, she actually started to feel a little bad for Nathalia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, William was quietly eating, not one to explain himself often-but for some reason, when he found out that Stella had misunderstood the situation, he had felt the need to clarify.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced up and caught her staring at him like he&#39;d grown an extra head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was with that look? Why did she seem so...fascinated?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she think it was funny... or just plain sad that a guy his age had never kissed anyone?</p>
