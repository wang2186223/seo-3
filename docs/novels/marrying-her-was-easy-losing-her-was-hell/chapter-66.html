                <p>Stella followed the directions to the room and stopped at the door. She reached out to knock,but the door opened easily with just a gentle push.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bit thrown off, she stepped inside cautiously.&#34;Excuse me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She barely got the words out when her eyes landed on William-he was in the middle of a shower, the bathroom door wide open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath hitched. Just as she turned to leave,William turned toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes locked, and Stella wished the floor would swallow her whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What brings you here?&#34; His expression was tight, clearly caught off guard by her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flustered, Stella stammered, &#34;I... I am your partner. We need to collect some samples.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William paused for a beat, then nodded and told her to give him a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella stood frozen, struggling to stop her gaze from drifting toward his defined frame. Before she could stop herself, the words slipped out.&#34;Do you want help washing your back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt wrong to let that strong, sculpted back go to waste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second the sentence left her mouth, regret kicked in hard, especially when she noticed William looking at her with a strange,unreadable look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart thudded, and she quickly tried to fix the situation. &#34;Wait, Mr. Briggs, I didn&#39;t mean anything weird. Really. It&#39;s just... I figuredd it must be hard to scrub your back alone, and if l helped,you&#39;d finish faster...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She meant to sound helpful, but each word</p>
                
                
                
                <p>made things worse. The awkwardness thickened in the air, and William&#39;s expression only grew colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wished she could take it all back. What was she even saying?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she seriously implying she wanted to join him in the shower?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William emerged from the bathroom, a towvel tied around his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of his broad, chiseled torso made Stella&#39;s breath catch again. Without thinking,she slapped both hands over her eyes. &#34;Mr.Briggs, what are you thinking? Y-you might want to put something on!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, they were a man and a woman, alone in the room, and he hadn&#39;t fully dressed yet-it simply felt improper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William said nothing as he stepped toward her,his calm presence contrasting with the visible panic on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of touching her, his hand reached past her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s eyes widened as he closed the distance.She backed away instinctively to avoid contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassment overwhelmed her, and all she wanted to do was flee, but before she could,William had already reached for the bathrobe hanging just behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slipped it on just as Stella lost her footing and tumbled backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, William moved quickly, catching her before she hit the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s arms flailed in panic, and in the process,she accidentally yanked at the robe, tearing it halfway off his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arm slid around her waist to steady her,pulling her against him without meaning to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His skin was cool from the shower, damp against her warm cheeks, which were now</p>
                
                
                
                <p>burning with embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella felt her heart drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever she attempted to clarify things with him,it always seemed to go wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time, she somehow wound up on his lap during a formal event, and now, she found herself in his arms again, with him barely dressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, she froze in place, completely forgetting to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William looked down at her, an amused glint in his eyes. &#34;Ms. Russell, you seem awfully settled in my arms. Are you not planning to move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s entire face turned crimson. She scrambled to free herself. &#34;No, it&#39;s not like that -wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she shifted, she felt a tug and realized, too late, that her clothes had caught on his towel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one horrifying second, the towel slipped-and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, once decently wrapped, now stood completely exposed before her at painfully close range.</p>
