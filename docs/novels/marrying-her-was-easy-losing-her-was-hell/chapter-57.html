                <p>Marc saw the way William and Stella looked at each other and felt a sharp pang of jealousy. He wanted to step in and pull them apart, but William&#39;s high status made him hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he could do was glare at Stella, silently hoping she&#39;d notice his frustration and take the hint to back away from other men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being a man, he could easily recognize the meaning behind William&#39;s gaze. It was possessive and dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Stella didn&#39;t look at him even once. She didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley studied the man beside Stella. Sure,he was good-looking and tall, but so what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And who exactly do you think you are?&#34; Haley</p>
                
                
                
                <p>sneered. &#34;Saying you signed some contract doesn&#39;t make it real. Did Stella hire you to play along in this little act of hers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley had grown up in Achury and only moved to Choria because of Marc. She didn&#39;t know many people here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So in her eyes, William was just some extra Stella had pulled in-not someone powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice crossed her arms with a scoff. &#34;What matters is proof, not who can talk the biggest game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people at the banquet held their breath.Haley might not know who William was, but they all certainly did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, they waited eagerly to see how Haley and her mother would embarrass themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, on the other hand, didn&#39;t lose his temper. Instead, he let out a quiet, amused chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a while since he&#39;d come across such pure stupidity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, seeing just how foolish people could be every now and then wasn&#39;t the worst thing-it was almost entertaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;William Briggs,&#34; he said calmly. &#34;Heir to the Briggs family in Briset. The MUE project with the Achury royal family and the Hookwood Research Institute? All under my name. Is that enough to qualify for Ms. Russell&#39;s patent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Towering at 6.2ft, his presence alone was enough to make Haley and Beatrice feel small.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley remembered her father talking about the MUE project-it was a huge deal, and they couldn&#39;t even get close to it. Yet this man had secured it himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was tied to royalty, something even local elites failed to win. Was William really that powerful?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice was just as stunned, though her experience helped her hide her reaction better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn, who had been quiet until now, was shaken by what she had just heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never imagined that this man was the head of one of the top business groups in Briset. His status was something most could only dream of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How in the world did Stella end up knowing someone like him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc already knew who William was, but watching him stand beside Stella with such calm authority made his blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, come here,&#34; Marc said firmly. &#34;You&#39;re still my wife. Being seen beside someone like Mr.Briggs might cause rumors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella frowned. She could tell Marc was only saying this to protect his wounded pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, William let out a cool chuckle.&#34;Oh? So you do remember she&#39;s your wife, Mr.Walsh? That&#39;s funny! I thought the woman beside you was your true match.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words, sharp and dripping wilI Saivaon -Marc red with embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc clenched his jaw, his fists curling at his sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella,&#34; he called again, hoping that if she came over now, he might still save face in front of William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Stella stepped away. &#34;Marc, stop the act.I was serious when I said I wanted a divorce.You betrayed me first. What did you expect would happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he really think she&#39;d stay chained to him forever?</p>
