                <p>Previously, when Marc&#39;s suspicions were first roused,he&#39;d immediately sent someone to trace the license plate, only to discover it belonged to William Briggs.That single fact gnawed at him-how on earth could Stella have any sort of tie to someone like William Briggs?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc was well aware of William&#39;s influence in Choria.Men of William&#39;s caliber never lacked for female attention, and Stella was just a commoner. There was no logical reason for a man like William to set his sights on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless... there was some hidden connection,something Marc hadn&#39;t yet uncovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, he couldn&#39;t ignore how Stella had grown increasingly withdrawn, slipping further and further from his grasp. Was her distance because of William?Or was something else pulling her away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella had just slipped free of William&#39;s orbit and was heading for the curb to hail a cab, relief only beginning to settle, when her gaze snagged on a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>familiar car idling across the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt of anxiety shot through her veins. The vehicle&#39;s headlights flashed, and in the next moment,it swung into a tight turn and pulled up right in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s door flew open. He climbed out, straightened his jacket, and met her stunned eyes with a look she couldn&#39;t read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He planted himself in her path, his tone low but edged with accusation. &#34;Stella, why haven&#39;t you come home these past few days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella couldn&#39;t help but taste the sting of irony when Marc still called that place &#34;home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve just had a lot going on,&#34; she replied, looking away as she fumbled for an excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Marc wasn&#39;t so easily dismissed. He pressed her, his tone unyielding. &#34;So being busy means you have to clear out all your things? Half the house is empty,Stella-and everything missing belongs to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fixed his eyes on her, silently demanding an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Stella felt a helpless frustration rising inside her. If she&#39;d been able to join the project team, maybe she wouldn&#39;t have to stand here facing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc, struggling to invent explanations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she faltered for words, Marc closed the distance between them. &#34;You even blocked my number. And the wedding photo-it&#39;s gone. Where did you put everything,Stella?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, mocking smile tugged at Stella&#39;s lips. So he&#39;d finally realized the wedding photo was missing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all this time, he&#39;d barely noticed-typical Marc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drew a steadying breath, then lifted her chin to meet his stare. &#34;I ran into a little financial trouble, so l pawned my things. Once I&#39;ve sorted things out,I&#39;ll get them back. As for the wedding photo, the frame was damaged, so I took it to have it restored.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella offered no explanation for blocking Marc,silently willing her earlier excuse to be enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc didn&#39;t press her about it-just as she&#39;d hoped-but his brow knitted with concern. &#34;If you needed money, why didn&#39;t you just tell me? There was no reason to pawn your things,&#34; he said, his tone equal parts reprimand and disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The items he&#39;d given her were barely worth anything at a pawn shop-just trinkets compared to what he could provide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Marc slid several bank cards into Stella&#39;s palm, his voice taking on that familiar,transactional warmth. &#34;Take these. Use them for whatever you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever trouble flared between them,Marc always tried to smooth things over with cash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the early days of their marriage, he&#39;d delighted in showering Stella with expensive gifts-luxury handbags,rare jewelry,anything with a hefty price tag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d handed her more than one card with no spending limit, as if money could buy her contentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even then, she&#39;d barely touched them,leaving the cards to collect dust in a bedside drawer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with divorce looming over them, she had even less reason to accept his generosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could pull his hand back, she brushed it aside with a firm shake of her head. &#34;That&#39;s not necessary. I&#39;ve already sorted the money myself.You can keep those cards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc hesitated, caught off guard by her refusal. He caught a flash of chill and barely veiled impatience in her eyes. Almost reflexively, he reached out and caught her wrist, his grip tightening as if he could</p>
                
                
                
                <p>anchor her with words. &#34;Stella, what are you hiding from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice dropped, roughened by frustration. &#34;We&#39;re still husband and wife. No matter what&#39;s going on-good or bad-you can tell me. I&#39;ll handle it with you.You don&#39;t have to shoulder everything alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she hadn&#39;t known he was wwhispering the same empty reassurances to Haley behind her back, maybe she&#39;d have fallen for his act again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Stella forced a thin, unbothered smile.&#34;There&#39;s nothing to tell. Work&#39;s been busy at the institute, and I have a business trip coming up. I&#39;ll be out of town for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she gently pried his fingers off her wrist and turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s voice cut through the air, tense and insistent.&#34;Wait!&#34;</p>
