                <p>Haley&#39;s reputation had already crashed and burned in front of the entire company, so not a single person dared to stick up for her. The crowd just watched,eager to witness her downfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hissed, &#34;You&#39;re nothing but a shameless witch-who gave you the right to talk to me like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage twisted Haley&#39;s features, her face flushing a furious crimson. Even the lowest-ranking employees were emboldened to stand up to her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allegra shot back. &#34;Didn&#39;t you go to college? Try acting like it, instead of hurling insults and making a spectacle of yourself. Anyway, I&#39;m not on the payroll anymore,so cut my/year-end bonus if it makes you happy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having delivered her parting shot, Allegra saw.no point in staying another second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting her resentment spill out in front of everyone felt like a small,hard-won victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without sparing Haley another glance, Allegra</p>
                
                
                
                <p>scooped up her things and strode out of the office building, chin lifted in quiet defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the air tasted sharper, as if the whole world had been scrubbed clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see Allegra just now? Who knew she had that kind of nerve!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She got pushed too far. Some folks think their title gives them a free pass, but all they do is dig their own grave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their colleagues&#39; biting comments drifted over,setting Haley&#39;s teeth on edge. She let out a shriek that rattled the windows. &#34;Ugh! You clueless idiots-just wait until Marc gets back! I&#39;ll make sure every single one of you is out on the street!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one bothered to argue. They traded knowing glances and quietly slipped back into their work routines,refusing to feed into Haley&#39;s meltdown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Marc actually intended to let them go, there were still procedures to follow. They had nothing to fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they sat at their desks, a creeping thought took hold-maybe Allegra had made the wisest move after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chaos Haley had unleashed had already left the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>company in shambles, and no one could say how much worse things might get.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was probably time for everyone to start thinking about their own next steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the mountain, Stella headed directly to the research institute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d risen before sunrise to climb the mountain,but still made it to the institute right on schedule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the project deadline loomed, Stella planted herself at the institute, buried in research from sunrise to nightfall-she hadn&#39;t stepped foot in the villa for days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey watched Stella bury herself in research,worry etched across her face. &#34;You can&#39;t keep running yourself into the ground like this. What if you faint?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile tugged at Stella&#39;s lips. &#34;I appreciate it,Lainey. Trust me, I know my limits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey could only sigh, resigning herself to Stella&#39;s stubborn streak. &#34;Hey, Stella, the list just came out!Come on, let&#39;s take a look. You could use a little breather.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt of anxiety shot through Stella as she pushed herself to her feet and hurried over to the newly posted sheet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes darted from the first name to the last,combing through each line with mounting tension.But her name was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold heaviness pressed down on her chest. Maybe she&#39;d skimmed past it? She started again from the top,scanning every letter as if willing her name to appear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after committing every name to memory,the result was the same-hers simply wasn&#39;t there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blinking in disbelief, Stella turned to meet Lainey&#39;s gaze, only to find her friend looking just as shocked and lost.Had she really not made it?</p>
