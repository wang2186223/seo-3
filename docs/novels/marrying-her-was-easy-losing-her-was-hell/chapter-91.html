                <p>William could tell she was bothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After working alongside her for half a year,he had come to understand that Stella wasn&#39;t as mild as she appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave off a calm presence, but when pushed, she didn&#39;t hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said nothing about her earlier reaction.Instead, he reached into his drawer and pulled out a sleek envelope, placing it gently in front of her. &#34;It&#39;s an invitation to Saul Vance&#39;s birthday banquet. He&#39;s the head of the Vance family in Sleka City.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Vance family? Back when she was with Marc, she had heard of them more than once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were a longstanding powerhouse in Sleka, dominating their field, and meeting them wasn&#39;t something just anyone could arrange. Even Marc, considered one of</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choria&#39;s rising figures, had never had access to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want me to go with you?&#34; she asked,unsure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had to be others in the company better suited for that kind of event, like his personal assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>W/illiam looked at her with a slight arch of his brow. &#34;No. I want you to attend on my behalf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked, caught off guard by the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you want to go?&#34; His question snapped her back to the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella quickly curved her lips into a smile. &#34;If you trust me with it, I&#39;d be glad to go. I just hope my limited knowledge of company matters won&#39;t embarrass us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chance like this didn&#39;t come often.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William lifted an eyebrow. &#34;Get ready properly, and don&#39;t make me look bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes locked for a moment, and something unspoken passed between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He always gave off that air-unshaken,composed-as if nothing surprised him, as though no matter what she said, he&#39;d already anticipated it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around him, her abilities felt insufficient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella picked up the invitation and smiled.&#34;Got it. I&#39;ll handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Sleka, Stella stepped into Saul Vance&#39;s birthday banquet wearing a champagne-colored gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room buzzed with conversation, the clatter of glasses, and soft music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a glass of juice in hand, she moved through the crowd, scanning for Saul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could find him, a few all-too-familiar faces caught her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley and Beatrice stood close by, dressed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>in coordinated lavender shades-one in a floor-length gown, the other in something shorter. They could&#39;ve passed for sisters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella sighed inwardly. Of all people to run into again...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to walk away, pretending she hadn&#39;t noticed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Haley caught a glimpse of her from the side while engaged in small talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand gripped Beatrice&#39;s arm with sudden force. Beatrice turned toward the motion and spotted Stella too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression changed instantly. &#34;Why is she here?&#34; she muttered, her tone sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley had already told her about Stella&#39;s so-called death. To them, Stella was a nuisance that never went away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her jaw tight and eyes burning, Haley stepped away from her group and strode straight toward Stella, blocking her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley leaned in slightly and said under her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>breath, &#34;What are you doing here, Stella?This is Saul Vance&#39;s banquet. You don&#39;t belong at an event like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella let out a soft chuckle and lifted an eyebrow. &#34;Ms. Smith, I&#39;ve said it before, my name is Sylvia Gilbert. As for where I choose to go, that&#39;s really none of your business.Unless... you&#39;ve taken an interest in me? Like me,perhaps?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s cheeks burned with fury. &#34;You can stop pretending. Call yourself Sylvia all you want, but I know exactly who you are. You&#39;re not that important. Why would I ever like someone like you? You hang onto powerful men like it&#39;s a job. What&#39;s appealing about that? So, which man brought you here tonight? You showing up at Saul&#39;s party is a disgrace to the guest list.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Haley, this was the perfect opportunity to trample Stella underfoot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her family had close ties with the Vance family and had stayed in touch ever since their days together in Achury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if the situation escalated, Haley believed Saul Would take both her side and her mother&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s playful tone faded, replaced by a sharp, cold look. &#34;Ms. Smith, did you skip brushing your teeth this morning? The smell is a bit much. I&#39;ve had a bit of spare time lately, so l did a little research. Turns out,there&#39;s something quite interesting. Ms.Smith, your hatred for Stella runs deep,is it because you&#39;ve been with her husband and hoped to replace her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s accusation sent a ripple through the nearby guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman of Haley&#39;s social standing, exposed as someone&#39;s mistress? The shock was immediate.</p>
