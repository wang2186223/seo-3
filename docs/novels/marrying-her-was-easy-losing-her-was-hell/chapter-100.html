                <p>William finished getting ready and grabbed his coat, clearly about to head out. Stella stayed put on the couch, making no move to see him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the door, William said casually, &#34;Had a new car delivered last night. It&#39;s yours to use when you go out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Stella glance over and notice the Ferrari keys sitting neatly on the entryway table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips twitched. They&#39;d just argued this morning, but somehow, she was walking away with a Ferrari. Not bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well then. Thanks, Mr. Briggs,&#34; she said, voice dry but not uungrateful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About half an hour after Williamleft, Stella finished tidying up and decided to head out herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed the keys, unlocked the car, slid into the driver&#39;s seat, and buckled up in one smooth motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to drive off, her eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>caught movement near the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squinted.Marc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She instantly rolled her eyes, hard. Without hesitation, she slammed her foot on the gas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc had been lurking since early morning. He saw William leave, then Stella step out alone.Fueled by impulse and whatever false sense of entitlement he had left, he moved in front of the car to block her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he hadn&#39;t expected Stella to be so ruthless;even with him standing in front of her car, she showed no hesitation in pressing thegas pedal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car sped toward him, he panicked and dove to the side, narrowly avoiding a real-life accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella! I&#39;m your husband! Are you seriously trying to run me over?! You want to see me dead or what?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella rolled the window down, her gaze sharp and her voice full of disdain. &#34;Mr. Walsh, are you hard of hearing or just stupid? You block my car first thing in the morning-what do you think was going to happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned an elbow casually on the window</p>
                
                
                
                <p>frame. &#34;I was just giving you what you clearly wanted. You got in my way. Don&#39;t act like the victim now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s expression twisted in frustration. &#34;Stel,how long are you gonna keep up this act?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella scoffed. &#34;Mr. Walsh, you should probably go see a doctor. I&#39;ve told you a hundred times-I&#39;m not Stella. Maybe your brain&#39;s broken, but are your ears busted too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc, clearly fed up, yanked at her car door,but she&#39;d locked it. Of course she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked to the car-a Ferrari-and the jealousy hit like a punch. William had bought her that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and William-this whole thing&#39;s just to get back at me, isn&#39;t it? How can you let a car can your loyalty? I&#39;m your husband, for God&#39;s sake!&#34;He was practically shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William might have bought her a car, but Marc had given her all his love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she being so heartless and kept pushing him away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s face turned cold. Her voice rose. &#34;Mr.Walsh, I&#39;m not your wife.What I do, who I&#39;m with</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-it&#39;s none of your business. If you don&#39;t back off,I&#39;ll call security.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if on cue, a security guard approached. &#34;Ms.Gilbert, is everything alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella pointed directly at Marc. &#34;I&#39;ve never seen him in my life. He&#39;s unstable and harassing me.I don&#39;t want to see him near this complex again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard didn&#39;t need more than that. &#34;Yes,ma&#39;am. We&#39;ll take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this upscale community, the residents were all wealthy or influential, and the security guards were obligated to protect them from harassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He signaled, and within seconds, five more guards appeared and closed in on Marc. &#34;Sir,please leave. If you don&#39;t, we&#39;ll have to call the police.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc tried to struggle, yelling as they dragged him off. &#34;You cheating woman! Sleeping around with another man while still married to me! Haley would never do this-she&#39;s kind, gentle, and knows how to please me in bed! You? You always did the same boring things-no spark at all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella didn&#39;t flinch. Instead, she smiled coldly and rolled up her window. &#34;Glad to hear you&#39;ve found</p>
                
                
                
                <p>your happily-ever-after, then. Hope you and Haley make lots of little heartbreakers together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she stepped on the gas, leaving Marc-and all his nonsense-in the dust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there, mouth open, watching the Ferrari disappear down the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d really left. Just like that.</p>
