                <p>Marc stared at Stella quietly, choosing his words carefully. &#34;Stel, please don&#39;t stay upset. You know l can&#39;t stand it when you&#39;re cold with me or when you pull away like this. Haley&#39;s about to finish school, and her parents are nervous about her joining some other firm. Our partnership with them means a lot for the company. I only see her as a friend-nothing beyond that,really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the more he explained, the more it felt like he was trying to cover something up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he genuinely thought he&#39;d done nothing wrong,why keep repeating himself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, even he knew that what happened with Haley had gone too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s voice turned sharp, her eyes distant. &#34;Would you kiss a friend like that? Hold her in your arms, like you did in your office?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s expression wavered briefly, but he quickly changed the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stel, let&#39;s have a baby,&#34; he said instead. &#34;Didn&#39;t you always say you wanted one? If we have a child, you&#39;ll always be my wife. You won&#39;t feel so insecure anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold shiver passed through her. Yes, once upon a time,she had wanted that-a child with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was back when she believed she was the only one in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when having a child felt like the most natural thing-a piece of the love they shared, a future built together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, after what he did with Haley,right in front of everyone,how could he still have the audacity to talk about having a baby?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he think a child was some kind of bargaining chip?Just a way for her to hold on to the title of Mrs.Walsh?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she supposed to accept being humiliated,sharing him with another woman,just for that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was being Mrs. Walsh even something she cared about anymore?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, it hit her-Marc never really understood her at al1. Everything they had, all those</p>
                
                
                
                <p>years, now felt like some tragic jok&lt;e.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, she shut her eyes and quietly slipped under the covers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc, however, took her silence as a green light.Smiling faintly, he switched off the light and wrapped his arms around her like everything between them was just fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his breath brushed against her ear, Stella&#39;s stomach turned. She kept her voice steady and muttered, &#34;I&#39;ve got a headache, maybe some other time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc paused,caught off guard. He finally remembered the injury she sustained ealier. &#34;Maybe the wound didn&#39;t get handled right. Let me grab the first aid kit -if it gets infected, that&#39;s serious! I&#39;m sorry,Stella.I should&#39;ve paid attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella let out a short,bitter laugh.She shoved his hand away and stepped aside. &#34;Lainey already took care of it. No need for your concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s face sank, the rejection hitting him like a splash of cold water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella couldn&#39;t take another moment beside him. &#34;I&#39;ll sleep in the study,&#34; she said quietly, slipping on her shoes and walking out without looking back. Marc didn&#39;t stop her and watched her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to admit Stella had always been stunning. From her graceful figure to her flawless looks, she effortlessly drew every eye in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t just beautiful-she was unforgettable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yes, he did love her. He loved the way she stood by him all these years, unwavering in her loyalty. He loved the stability she brought to his life, the way her presence grounded him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the women outside? They were just passing flings, brief moments of thrill. None of them could ever replace Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d never let anyone take her place as Mrs. Walsh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just wanted some variety, that&#39;s all-it was a mistake any man could make.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t care for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just angry now, but he was sure she&#39;d come around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Stella had already left for the research institute by the time Marc even opened his eyes. She didn&#39;t bother waiting for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she arrived, Lainey rushed over and pulled her aside. &#34;Stella, something&#39;s changed. They&#39;ve made</p>
                
                
                
                <p>adjustments to the team for the closed project.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s heart skipped a beat. Her voice shook. &#34;What do you mean? I thought the list was final. Why would it change now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey frowned,clearly just as frustrated. &#34;I&#39;m not sure.They said they&#39;ll release the updated list later.William&#39;s on the project too now. Because of his position, he has to personally review every name on the team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of unease hit Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If everyone was being reviewed again, that meant even those who had already been selected could lose their spot-hers included!</p>
