                <p>Stella drove her modest black Volkswagen straight through the gates of the Hookwood Research Institute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she stepped inside the main office building, Lainey Lewis, her senior colleague,marched up and grabbed her by the wrist.&#34;You&#39;re seriously here to submit the application?What&#39;s going on, Stella? You didn&#39;t reply to my messages. You can&#39;t just make a decision like this on a whim. This project isn&#39;t some experiment, and you should&#39;ve at least discussed it with Marc.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp ache rose in Stella&#39;s chest, but she remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,she unlocked her phone, scrolled to a WhatsApp conversation, and handed it over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dozens of provocative messagesand suggestive images stared back-sent more than</p>
                
                
                
                <p>once. One photo in particular left nothing to the imagination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey glanced at the screen, then immediately shoved the phone back into Stella&#39;s hands, her eyes blazing. &#34;That bastard! If it weren&#39;t for your patents back then, his company wouldn&#39;t have even made it past launch. And now he&#39;s cheating on you? Come on, we&#39;re going back. I swear I&#39;ll make him crawl on his knees begging for mercy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella quickly caught her arm. &#34;No. That won&#39;t be necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean, not necessary? After what he&#39;s done? You&#39;re just going to stand there and let him get away with it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was shaking, but Stella&#39;s was cool and even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let him off? Never.&#34; She slid her phone back into her coat pocket. &#34;Facing him head-on would be far too easy. I want him to suffer... to truly regret everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey said nothing more. She knew exactly the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>kind of person Stella was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brilliant in the lab. Honest to a fault. But if someone pushed her beyond her limits, she&#39;d never let it go quietly. She&#39;d bounce back when they least expected it-with precision and force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked together toward the administrative office,and the form submission went smoothly.A few steps, a couple of stamps, and everything was nearly finalized-just awaiting the final review.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she left, Stella volunteered to attend an academic seminar on behalf of the institute and gather the necessary materials.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By 3:30 p.m., the event at the Grace Hotel had wrapped up. Holding a folder against her chest,Stella stepped out of the lobby, making her way toward the parking lot when a familiar, lazy chuckle reached her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on now, be good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body stiffened at once. The moment she heard that voice, she slowly turned around. A wave of betrayal crashed over her, as if the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ground beneath her had shifted without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc had his arm wrapped around a long-haired woman with a slim waist, guiding her through the entrance of the hotel. The woman chirped,&#34;I miss you... miss you so much,&#34; her voice syrupy and intimate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she said it, she leaned into Marc, her lips trailing from his earlobe down his neck, her red lipstick smudging along his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc laughed, low and fond, drawing her even closer, his palm firmly resting at the curve of her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s vision blurred for a second,her chest tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was where the woman had followed him -to this very hotel-and they couldn&#39;t even wait until nightfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,through the slowly spinning glass of the revolving door, their eyes met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s gaze was dark and full of desire, wvhile Stella&#39;s eyes were calm and distant, with a hint</p>
                
                
                
                <p>of mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air between them suddenly felt heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman noticed Stella too. But instead of looking startled, she simply smiled smugly, then turned and kissed Marc again-this time deeper,more deliberate, as if marking her territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter taste rose in Stella&#39;s throat. Her stomach churned wvith nausea. She turned away,refusing to witness the spectacle any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for her car door, but before she could get into the car, a hand stopped her from behind. Marc had chased after her, a little breathless, and the smell of that woman&#39;s bold perfume still clung to him-strong enough to make her sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go!&#34; Stella tried to shake him off, but the door wouldn&#39;t budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc didn&#39;t say a word-he just grabbed her waist and pushed her into the back seat, sliding in right after. His sharp features looked tense,and his eyes flickered with a strange mix of anxiety and impatience. &#34;Stella, please, let me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With nowhere to run, Stella shifted away and spoke in a frozen tone. &#34;Wipe that lipstick off your mouth before you start talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s face fell. His hand flew to his mouth without thinking, eyes flashing with a hint of panic. &#34;The Marina Horizon deal&#39;s in trouble. I&#39;ve been stressing over the funding and reached out to Nova Holdings. Haley Smith-she&#39;s the daughter of a board member of Nova Holdings.She doesn&#39;t speak our language well and had been drinking. I was just making sure she got back to the hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was gentle, and he leaned in the way he always did when he wanted to charm her.&#34;She&#39;s from Achury. People in her country are pretty relaxed, you know that. I swear I&#39;ll be more careful. Don&#39;t be upset, okay? I&#39;ll make it up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella looked at him, her eyes sharp and cold.&#34;So... is that how you secure investments? By getting that close to their daughters?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no shouting, no tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella spoke with a chilling calm, too composed to be angry. Her quiet words stripped every excuse from Marc&#39;s mouth, leaving them meaningless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same heavy emptiness crashed into him again. Frustrated, he pulled at his tie,trying to breathe.&#34;Stella, come on. It&#39;s for work. Can you not blow this out of proportion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella almost laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t even raised her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he want her to throw the photos in his face to make it count as drama?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The love she&#39;d held onto all these years now burned like a blade in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re done with me, Marc,just be honest.I won&#39;t hold on-I&#39;ll give you the divorce you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did he have to play games? Why lie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after those words left her mouth,Marc grabbed her shoulder-hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were ice. &#34;Don&#39;t ever say that. We promised-no matter what, we&#39;d work through it. Divorce is not an option. Don&#39;t even mention it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Work it out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already slept with someone else. What was left to fix now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like she was trapped in a web of thorns.Every breath, every movement cut deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Marc&#39;s phone rang. He checked it,frowned, and declined the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Stella caught the name on the screen.&#34;Sweetheart Wild Thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could tuck it away, the phone lit up again-this time, WhatsApp messages popping up. The sender&#39;s name? &#34;Sizzling Baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby, I&#39;m in pain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you. Come now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m bleeding... am I going to die?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three texts, all in Achure, one after another.</p>
