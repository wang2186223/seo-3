                <p>Stella wasn&#39;t sure why the rule had been changed SO suddenly, but given how awkward her last exchange with William had been, she couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that he changed the rule because of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, this was her one shot at changing her current life,and she wasn&#39;t about to let it go to waste. If William had misunderstood her, she&#39;d clear things up-no matter what it took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;William&#39;s brilliant when it comes to research,&#34; Lainey gushed. &#34;But let&#39;s be real. The Briggs family basically owns half of Briset. He&#39;s their only heir, so I figure he&#39;s just here enjoying some freedom before heading back to take over the empire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was admiration or fascination, Lainey clearly loved talking about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella said nothing,her expression unreadable and her thoughts tucked far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s famnily wealth didn&#39;t impress her. In her eyes,he was simply a fellow researcher-nothing more,nothing less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What his family owned or controlled had absolutely nothing to do with her goals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she wanted was this opportunity-to get her foot in the door and never look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey,mid-ramble, suddenly lit up with a mischievous grin and elbowed Stella. &#34;Hey, imagine if you actually won over William. Wouldn&#39;t that drive your pathetic husband crazy? Just picture it-once this project wraps up,you&#39;d have both a thriving career and a man who&#39;s way better than Marc. Sounds like a win-win,doesn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella let out a soft laugh. Lainey&#39;s imagination never failed to amaze her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, her mind was laser-focused on research.Men, love, or revenge-none of that had a place in her current world. Getting into the team was all that mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,if William was truly the one rechecking the list,then she needed to speak with him directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, this wasn&#39;t the right place-not here at the research institute with so many people watching.She needed a better time and a more private setting to approach him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella looked up and asked calmly, &#34;Lainey, can you help me get a moment alone with Mr. Briggs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s eyes lit up with excitement. &#34;Of course! Leave it to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A private meeting?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was already daydreaming about being their matchmaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that settled, Stella felt a small sense of relief and threw herself back into her work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That afternoon, when she got home, she didn&#39;t expect company,but Marc was there, sitting on the sofa like he belonged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lounged casually, flipping through a magazine while she silently changed out of her shoes by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he saw her, he stood up with a smile.&#34;You&#39;re home. Are you hungry? I can ask the kitchen to make something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore that same warm, attentive mask, acting like there had never been betrayal, never been distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella couldn&#39;t help but find his act utterly ridiculous -laughable,even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc used to tell her he was swamped with work,claiming he couldn&#39;t make it home regularly. And she had believed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, before she learned the truth about him and Haley,she had trusted his every word. She never once questioned why he stayed out late or didn&#39;t show up at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now that everything had come to light, now that the illusion had shattered, he suddenly had all this free time to come back and play house?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If work had really kept him so busy before,then how was he finding the time now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not hungry. Eat by yourself.&#34; Her voice was cold,detached. She didn&#39;t have the strength or desire to sit across from him and pretend things were normal. Even his smile made her sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She headed upstairs without sparing him another glance, but Marc&#39;s brows knitted together, clearly displeased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella, skipping meals isn&#39;t good for your health. Just tell me what you want, and I&#39;ll have my assistant bring it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella paused at the bottom of the staircase, turned</p>
                
                
                
                <p>back slightly, and lifted an eyebrow. &#34;Looking at you ruins my appetite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That shut him up. He glanced at the fading bruise on her head and knew she was saying it to humiliate him.Still,her words stung more than he expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief silence,he took a deep breath and tried again, &#34;Didn&#39;t you once say you wanted to visit Hoxphis for a vacation? I&#39;ll be free next month. Let&#39;s go together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows lifted again. She had brought up the idea of visiting Hoxphis more than once after they got married, but Marc always brushed it aside, either blaming work or promising he&#39;d &#34;arrange it later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,out of nowhere, he was eager for a trip? If she hadn&#39;t pulled the plug on the company&#39;s collaboration,she knew full well he wouldn&#39;t have even considered taking time off during such a crucial phase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His efforts to please her now were painfully obvious.Anyone could see right through it. It wasn&#39;t about love or reconciliation-it was about the patent she controlled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just for that patent, he was now magically clearing his schedule and pretending to be the devoted husband again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Marc, both she and Haley were just stepping stones to power, and nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella let out a dry laugh. &#34;I don&#39;t want to go to Hoxphis anymore. I&#39;ve got better things to do. If you&#39;re still set on that trip, why don&#39;t you take Haley instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s expression turned stormy the moment she said that. &#34;Stella, don&#39;t talk to me like that. I hate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her bluntness annoyed him. He had apologized,hadn&#39;t he? Why couldn&#39;t she just move on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He really did want to take her to Hoxphis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t like he ever held back when it came to making her happy, so what more did she want from him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then how exactly am I supposed to talk toyou?&#34;she said sharply. &#34;Should I just sit down and have a pleasant litte heart-to-heart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sarcasm dripped like acid, but Marc missed the jab completely. &#34;Yeah, we should definitely talk,&#34; he replied seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made Stella laugh-not from amusement, but disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine. If he wanted to talk, they would talk. She was curious anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it just about the patent, or was he after something else too? Either way, she was done playing along.</p>
