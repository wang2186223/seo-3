                <p>Stella glanced at the pair and let out a bright,unrestrained laugh. &#34;I&#39;m just laying out the truth here.That membership card you&#39;re so fond of? My friend owns the salon-I got you a ninety percent discount.The health supplements you&#39;re taking every month-why not ask Marc who&#39;s really footing the bill? And everyone at the casino knows exactly how many toes you&#39;ve stepped on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All those perks Jazlyn enjoyed had never meant anything to Stella before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just the monthly supplements alone added up to a hefty sum, but Stella had never gone to Marc for a single cent-she&#39;d always covered the cost herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that the divorce was underway,she saw no reason not to reclaim every last bit, plus interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn&#39;s expression soured with each word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She might have outranked Stella socially,but Stella wasn&#39;t known for spinning stories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn was thoroughly used to her regular beauty</p>
                
                
                
                <p>appointments, and	those	supplements	felt indispensable. If she lost access to either,her body would almost certainly show it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought left Jazlyn uncertain, her gaze dropping for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those perks were nothing if not real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley, picking up on her hesitation, felt a rush of nerves. She clutched Jazlyn&#39;s hand and blurted,&#34;Please, Mrs. Walsh, don&#39;t worry. From now on, I&#39;ll make sure you have everything you need. Your standard of living won&#39;t drop, I swear! Supplements,salon treatments-I have plenty of connections. I&#39;ll handle it all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella caught the desperate edge in Haley&#39;s voice and fought the urge to roll her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything she&#39;d named so far barely scratched the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn&#39;s condition was fragile, and ordinary supplements weren&#39;t enough-she relied on an elusive remedy that couldn&#39;t be bought, no matter how deep your pockets were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella herself had once flown overseas and spent more than two weeks tracking it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn cared deeply about appearances and chased after every opportunity to climb the social ladder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Stella married Marc, she&#39;d gone out of her way to secure Jazlyn a prestigious-if mostly ceremonial -professor title at a university.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That title had opened countless doors for Jazlyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At every school function, she could step onto the stage, soaking in the admiration that fed her pride year after year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, with Stella out of the picture, the university would almost certainly strip her of that honor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley might grit her teeth and try to pull strings, but as the heiress of the Smith family, would she really go that far for Jazlyn&#39;s sake?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That seemed highly unlikely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she refused to comply, Jazlyn would kick up a storm,dragging the entire Walsh family into chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, Stella found herself almost anticipating the spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley, oblivious to the amusement flickering in Stella&#39;s eyes, poured all her effort into manipulating Jazlyn, urging her to pressure Stella and Marc into</p>
                
                
                
                <p>splitting up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn&#39;s patience finally snapped. She jabbed a finger in Stella&#39;s direction, voice quivering with frustration.&#34;Fine. If you claim all that&#39;s gone, then so be it. But l want you to divorce my son-right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella just gave a weary shake of her head. Predictably,Haley only needed to prod a little to get Jazlyn riled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling back against the armchair, Stella studied the two women facing her, their postures stiff with self-importance. &#34;Alright. But a divorce requires both parties to show up. If you can get Marc here, I won&#39;t stand in your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d expected some grand ultimatum, but this was all they had-just another ploy to make her file the divorce first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a pointless waste of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither Jazlyn nor Haley could come up with a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were painfully aware that Marc refused to even discuss divorce-if he hadn&#39;t, they wouldn&#39;t have dragged Stella out here in secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn&#39;s temper snapped. &#34;I&#39;m Marc&#39;s mother.Doesn&#39;t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>that count for anything? I want you out, and even if you refuse, you&#39;ll have to leave!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella found the whole thing faintly ridiculous.&#34;Jazlyn,I&#39;m not doubting your authority, but you can&#39;t sign those papers on Marc&#39;s behalf. If you&#39;re so determined,maybe spend your energy convincing him instead of wasting mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had gotten what she needed from the meeting.With a cold nod, Stella slung her bag over her shoulder and headed for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn instinctively tried to block her path but couldn&#39;t find any justification, so she was forced to let Stella walk out unchallenged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Jazlyn refused to feel anxious-she comforted herself with the thought that it wouldn&#39;t be long before Stella paid the price.</p>
