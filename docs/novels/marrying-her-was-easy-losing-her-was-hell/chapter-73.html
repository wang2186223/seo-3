                <p>Nathalia refused to believe that William didn&#39;t feel anything for her. No-he had to.He was just too stubborn to admit it. If she pushed a little harder, maybe he&#39;d stop pretending to be so distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment she leaned in, lips barely brushing his-William&#39;s eyes widened. In a flash, his hand came up to block her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathalia ended up kissing his hand. She froze. The next second, he pushed her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Fuller, get a grip on yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just one sentence-but they hit her harder than a slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d already thrown away her pride to take the first step. And still... he wouldn&#39;t even waver?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body swayed slightly, and the tears</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she&#39;d been holding back started to fall one by one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t even spare her another look.He turned and walked away. But just as he rounded the corner, he stopped. On the floor lay a familiar hair tie-blue, with a little star on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bent down and picked it up, dusting it off with a thumb. He recognized it instantly.Stella&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d teased her once about it-wasn&#39;t it too childish for her? Yet somehow, it suited her perfectly. Only Stella could pull off something so silly-looking and still make it seem natural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at it for a beat longer than necessary, then tucked it into his pocket.Something about it tugged at his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Stella showered, dried her hair,and curled up under the covers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts wandered back to the scene she&#39;d accidentally witnessed earlier. William</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and Nathalia... standing so close. From her angle, it really did look like they were kissing.She buried her face in the blanket and sighed. Can&#39;t those two be a little more discreet?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Stella arrived early for breakfast. The cafeteria was still mostly empty, so she picked a quiet spot and began eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through, a familiar pair of clean,black shoes stopped right in front of her.She didn&#39;t need to look up to know who it was.William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat down across from her, and her whole body stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did he choose this table when there were literally dozens of empty ones?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he out of his mind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she didn&#39;t know was that in his headd,it made perfect sense-they were in the same group. Might as well eat together and head out after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Stella didn&#39;t consider that. All she saw was Nathalia walking into the room. Without a second thought, she grabbed her tray and bolted like she&#39;d just spotted a ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want any part of their love triangle drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s brow twitched. He hadn&#39;t even said anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him now sitting alone, Nathalia made her move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed her tray, walked over, and asked sweetly, &#34;Mind if I sit here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William said nothing. So she sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She noticed his tray was mostly greens.Trying to seem considerate, she picked up her untouched chicken leg and moved her fork toward his plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William blocked it without hesitation. &#34;Miss Fuller,&#34; he said calmly, &#34;this is a research institute. I suggest you put more focus into your work. And please-don&#39;t worry about</p>
                
                
                
                <p>my meals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he stood up and left, tray in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathalia was left sitting there alone, appetite gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes trailed across the cafeteria until she spotted Stella at another table. She clenched her fists, then got up and headed straight toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella was feeling pretty proud of herself for dodging disaster, until Nathalia sat down across from her. She braced herself, forcing a polite smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathalia, trying to look composed, said, &#34;Ms.Russell, I hope you won&#39;t cling to William. He and I just have a few unresolved issues.That&#39;s no excuse for you to take advantage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella blinked. Was this woman serious?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which eye of hers had seen Stella &#34;clinging&#34;to anyone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She calmly set down her fork and cleared her throat. &#34;Miss Fuller, let me say this clearly:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>have no interest in William. I&#39;m here to work,not flirt with someone else&#39;s ex. I barely have time to sleep, let alone deal with jealousy games.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathalia&#39;s expression hardened, but she wasn&#39;t giving up. &#34;You don&#39;t need to pretend with me. I know you&#39;re just trying to get his attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella rolled her eyes so hard they nearly fell out. &#34;Your relationship problems are not my responsibility. I&#39;ve kept everything with him strictly professional. If you don&#39;t like seeing us talk, maybe you should request a transfer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had done her best to steer clear of the drama, but Nathalia seemed hell-bent on dragging her in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were all part of the same research institute, and she couldn&#39;t just run away every time she saw William,could she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it&#39;s not you chasing him...&#34; Nathalia sneered, &#34;are you suggesting he&#39;s chasing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to what Stella had said, Nathalia found it even harder to believe that William would be the one pursuing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella didn&#39;t bother explaining any further.What was the point? Love had a way of making people irrational.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Believe what you want, Miss Fuller,&#34; she said with a small smile. &#34;Enjoy your meal.I&#39;m done here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in her dorm room, Stella flopped onto her bed with a heavy sigh. She rubbed her temple, then reached for her phone, hoping a mindless scroll through social media would help her decompress. But the moment she unlocked the screen, a new notification lit up the top. A message from William, sent ten minutes ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat up abruptly, blinking in disbelief.</p>
