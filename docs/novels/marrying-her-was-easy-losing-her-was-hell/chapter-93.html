                <p>Saul paused mid-move, a chess piece in hand,his expression tightening. &#34;Barely relatives,&#34; he muttered. &#34;Haven&#39;t seen either of them in over ten years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William already knew the background. Haley had stayed in Achury all her life,while Saul had built his world in Sleka. They might&#39;ve shared some blood, but there wasn&#39;t much of a bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But today&#39;s your birthday, and they made a point to show up,&#34; William said casually. &#34;Looks like they&#39;re trying to gain some favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Especially after how they embarrassed themselves back in Choria-it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if they were here trying to clean up their image.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That clearly rubbed Saul the wrong way. He hadn&#39;t been strict with the guest list today;anyone who wanted to celebrate was welcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if Haley and Beatrice were here just to cozy up and benefit off his name? They were set up for a big surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They can keep dreaming.&#34; The sharpness in his voice made his stance crystal clear-he wasn&#39;t about to let them take advantage of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rarely visited Achury, and even if he did,he wouldn&#39;t need Haley to accompany him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean,&#34; William continued, &#34;they&#39;re already causing a scene. Your birthday celebration&#39;s at risk of turning into a circus. Haley just took a tumble out there. Sure, it&#39;s her own embarrassment, but if things keep escalating,your whole party could get derailed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saul shot a glance at the monitor, clearly irritated,then moved his bishop without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William moved his queen, smirking. &#34;Checkmate.Looks like I won this round.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saul tore his gaze away from the screen, scanned the board, and let out a scoff. &#34;You crafty bastard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William had been rattling on about Haley and her mother&#39;s social-climbing to distract him-and it had worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d fallen for it and made a bad move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not many people could match Saul in chess, and even fewer dared to sit across from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was one of the few who could go toe-to-toe with him on the board.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this win? It didn&#39;t sit right with Saul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You set me up for your little office crush? This round doesn&#39;t count. Let&#39;s go again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t argue. He just started resetting the board,but added, &#34;She&#39;s not my girlfriend. She works at Briggs Group. I just value her skills.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saul didn&#39;t believe a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were many employees at Briggs Group, but William had never openly backed anyone like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he wasn&#39;t about to admit it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saul rolled his eyes. &#34;Anyway, enough of that. One more game. And no distractions this time. I&#39;ll take care of those two outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William laughed under his breath. &#34;Fine by me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the board was reset, Saul waved at the butler standing quietly behind them. &#34;Go handle it. This is my birthday. If anyone causes a ruckus,toss them out. No exceptions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler gave a small bow. He&#39;d heard everything and didn&#39;t need more instructions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir. I&#39;ll take care of it right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he left the room. Saul relaxed and leaned back in his chair. &#34;Now, can we finally focus on this match?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t answer-just moved a pawn forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Haley was still fuming, barely steady on her feet as Beatrice helped her up. She glared daggers at Stella. &#34;You really think you can humiliate me and walk away? Do you even know who my father is? We&#39;re here for Saul Vance&#39;s birthday-I&#39;ll have you kicked out of here in seconds!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shoved Beatrice&#39;s hand away and made to charge at Stella again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before her raised hand could come down,a cold voice rang out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who dares to make a scene at Mr. Vance&#39;s birthday?&#34; It was Terence, the Vance family&#39;s butler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped between Haley and Stella like a wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley scowled. &#34;And who do you think you are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terence didn&#39;t flinch. His expression was calm,but there was an unmistakable edge to his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Saul went abroad to recuperate, he had been busy managing domestic affairs and hadn&#39;t gone along, unaware of how arrogant the Smith family was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Terence Ramsey. Butler to the Vance family.And when I speak, I speak on behalf of Mr. Vance himself.&#34; The room went quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued, voice firm, &#34;Miss Gilbert is a distinguished guest of the Vance family. Anyone who disrespects her-disrespects us. And Mr.Vance doesn&#39;t tolerate disrespect in his home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone around froze in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terence Ramsey? The butler of the Vance family?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant Mr. Vance was Saul himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just moments ago, Haley had been flaunting her so-called family connection to the Vances. But now? Saul was openly backing Sylvia.</p>
