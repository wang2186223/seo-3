                <p>&#34;Let him in,&#34; Steven said with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing by the doorway, Kevin Sampson&#39;s expression was difficult to read. He had caught the tail end of everything that had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had come to discuss a potential collaboration with Steven, but instead, he walked into the middle of a scandal, and a pretty revealing one at that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take him long to recognize the man at thecenter of it all-Marc Walsh, from the Walsh Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin had previously been leaning toward partnering with the Walsh Group, but with their patent no longer secure, he was already second-guessing that decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley, on the other hand, had been</p>
                
                
                
                <p>leveraging her family&#39;s clout at Achury to push him toward going through with the deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he&#39;d been wavering, Steven&#39;s remarks only solidified his decision. He was now firmly set on pulling out of the collaboration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc looked up and froze when he saw Kevin at the entrance. The very investor he and Haley had been courting relentlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Sampson!&#34; he exclaimed in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin&#39;s face remained unreadable. After a brief pause, he got straight to the point. &#34;Mr.Walsh, since fate has brought us together here today, I&#39;ll give you my answer now.l won&#39;t be pursuing the collaboration with Walsh Group. If the stars align in the future,we might revisit it, but for now,I&#39;m out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After delivering his message, Kevin turned to Stella. Her poise amidst the chaos caught his attention. She hadn&#39;t flinched once.Intriguing, to say the least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with everything unfolding around her,she radiated calm confidence-a quiet strength that hinted at success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss,&#34; Kevin began, &#34;I overheard a bit about your technology earlier. It sounds promising.Would you be willing to share more details?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella immediately recognized him-Kevin Sampson, the influential head of one of Briset&#39;s three major families.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella began to smile and offered her hand,but before she could say anything, Haley cut in,practically shouting, &#34;Mr. Sampson, don&#39;t let her fool you! She&#39;s not who you think she is! We were supposed to collaborate-remember? You made a promise to me... and to my family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she mentioned her family,Kevin&#39;s face clouded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone sharpened as he interrupted, &#34;Ms.Smith, you&#39;re standing on our soil now. I suggest you tread carefully. Don&#39;t let your family&#39;s influence abroad make you forget</p>
                
                
                
                <p>where you are. Push too far, and you just might regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since when did the Sampson family bow to pressure from foreign interests?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s face drained of color, and her hands balled into fists. &#34;She&#39;s a fraud! Even her name&#39;s not real!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That struck a chord.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Stella&#39;s gaze turned icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Smith,&#34; Stella said coolly. &#34;What exactly is your connection to Mr. Walsh that makes you so invested in his problems?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Haley declared,&#34;Marc and I are together. I&#39;m his girlfriend. Of course his business is mine, too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing that, Stella turned to Marc with a look of mock surprise, her voice laced with sarcasm. &#34;Oh? So it&#39;s official now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s expression instantly darkened as he shot a sharp glare at Haley. His displeasure was obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she saw his reaction, Haley&#39;s confidence faltered. A flicker of unease crossed her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, she knew Marc had never truly seen her as a girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in front of Stella, she couldn&#39;t help herself-she had to stake her claim, even if it was just an illusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had stayed by his side for six months and shared everything with him. Why shouldn&#39;t she be acknowledged as his girlfriend?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing how Marc was clearly furious but trying to keep it in, Stella let out a soft,mocking laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had no idea you two were a couple,&#34; she began, her tone drenched in sarcasm. &#34;But didn&#39;t you just tell me at the party a few days ago that your heart belonged to your wife,Mr. Walsh? And now, suddenly, you&#39;ve fallen for someone else? That was quick. From the looks of it, this doesn&#39;t seem like a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>relationship-it seems more like an affair.Or maybe you both enjoy this kind of sneaky little drama. I may not know this &#39;Stella,&#39; but whoever she is... I feel bad for her. Watching two people shamelessly parade around like soulmates? What a joke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With both Kevin and Steven watching,Stella didn&#39;t bother with politeness. She tore straight through their carefully crafted facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s face froze. But then something flickered behind his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this be jealousy? Was she upset because she still cared?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to care. Why else would she react like that to Haley&#39;s claim? That must&#39;ve hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips curled into a smile, mistaking her disgust for longing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re jealous, aren&#39;t you, Stel?&#34; he said smugly. &#34;That&#39;s why you said all that. You can deny it all you want, but you&#39;re still my Stella.&#34;</p>
