                <p>Saul&#39;s brows knitted together as he shot her a sharp look. &#34;Outsider? If something from an outsider is more to my liking than your cheap knockoff,then I&#39;ll take it-no questions asked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice&#39;s expression froze. Se clearly hadn&#39;t expected him to be so direct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley, growing flustered, tried to salvage the moment. &#34;It&#39;s just an amber tobacco pipe, Saul.If you like it, I can send over a few more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just an amber tobacco pipe?&#34; Saul scoffed,already losing patience. &#34;Do you have any idea how rare fossilized amber is? Or how difficult it is to carve an authentic piece like this? This isn&#39;t something you toss around like party favors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley was stunned. How did Stella manage to get her hands on something so rare and expensive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her jaw, unable to accept yet another defeat, but no words came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saul turned his eyes from Beatrice to Stella, his tone much gentler now. &#34;Ms. Gilbert, I really liked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the gift you gave me. Wouid you mlnu takiny a walk with me in the garden? I&#39;d like to have a quick word with you in private.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella was here on William&#39;s behalf, mainly to discuss business collaboration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, with Saul personally requesting a chat,she gave a polite smile and nodded. &#34;I&#39;d be glad to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley and Beatrice stood still, watching Stella leave with Saul. Jealousy burned in their eyes-they were so bitter, it seemed like they might explode. At that moment, they both wished they could tear Stella apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Stella passed them, she let out a soft, mocking chuckle, clearly unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So what if Haley came from a noble family in Achury? A name alone couldn&#39;t cover up shallow roots and dull minds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella walked alongside Saul through the back garden when her gaze caught a quick-moving figure in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It vanished too fast to identify, but something</p>
                
                
                
                <p>about it felt strangely familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could that have been William?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea popped into her mind, but she quickly dismissed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If William were here, he wouldn&#39;t have sent her instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head slightly. Maybe she was just overthinking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saul noticed where she was looking, his gaze turning thoughtful. But he said nothing, simply smiling. &#34;You&#39;re here on business today,I take it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella answered without delay. &#34;Yes. I&#39;m here on behalf of Briggs Group. Mr. Vance, if youI give us a shot, I&#39;m confident both parties will benefit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was poised, respectful, and unmistakably confident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saul chuckled softly and changed the subject.&#34;With your talent, Ms. Gilbert, I imagine you&#39;ve got plenty of admirers. Are you seeing anyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella blinked in surprise, unsure where this was heading. But she answered plainly, &#34;You&#39;re too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>kind,Mr.Vance. No, I&#39;m not dating anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? Then what kind of man do you like? I happen to know several excellent bachelors. I&#39;d be happy to make an introduction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he trying to set her up? Stella politely declined without missing a beat. &#34;I appreciate the offer, but my focus right now is completely on work. I&#39;m not in a place to think about romance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saul noted her resolute tone and pressed his lips together in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought back to William&#39;s composed strategy during their earlier board game. At the time, he had assumed William was the predator and Stella the prey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, the roles weren&#39;t so clear anymore. How amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They resumed talking business, and Saul seemed pleased, eventually agreeing to the partnership with Briggs Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her mission accomplished, Stella politely excused herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the hall, just as she reached the roadside,</p>

                <p>a car rolled up from the underground garage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She narrowed her eyes. That car... it looked very familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car slowed to a stop right in front of her, the window rolled down, and there he was. William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s gaze sharpened. So that shadow earlier...was it really him after all?</p>
