                <p>Jazlyn arrived at the charity gala in a frenzy,practically speeding the whole way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she stepped through the entrance,Haley-who&#39;d been anxiously watching the door -spotted her and rushed over, heels clicking.&#34;Jazlyn!&#34; she called sweetly, her voice almost musical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn turned and smiled, letting Haley clasp her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave it a light, approving pat. &#34;You look absolutely gorgeous, sweetheart. That dress is stunning on you. Did Marc pick it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley blushed, eyes dropping for a second. &#34;He did. Said the color suited me. But if you think l look good, then I know I nailed it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So far, Jazlyn was pleased. Haley, no matter how calculating in private, always made sure to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>show her proper respect in public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jazlyn was here for more than compliments.&#34;Alright, darling, why did you call me over?Something you need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She eyed Haley closely, trying to figure out if this was the big moment-if Haley was finally planning to release those scandalous photos of Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And more importantly-why had the men gone off radar? No texts, no calls, no photos. Had Haley gotten to them first?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn wanted to ask but bit her tongue. This wasn&#39;t the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley, meanwhile, watched Jazlyn&#39;s calm demeanor with growing relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She figured that Jazlyn didn&#39;t dare to post those photos after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she couldn&#39;t say that out loud. Instead,she leaned in and spoke in a soft, suggestive tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, tonight&#39;s a big deal. My mother&#39;s arriving soon to sign a direct partnership with Marc. But... with my current status, things are complicated...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if that explained it all, she pulled out a folded document from her clutch and handed it to Jazlyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This,&#34; she said with a triumphant gleam,&#34;is what Stella signed yesterday. Voluntarily. She was so scared, she didn&#39;t even argue. With this contract, the patent issue&#39;s resolved-and she&#39;s got nothing left to bargain with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her implication was clear-Stella had no more cards to play. Haley wanted Jazlyn to stop being hesitant and release the indecent photos already. Once Stella&#39;s name was ruined and Marc had no choice but to file for divorce, she&#39;d finally be able to stand openly by his side. That way, her mother could confidently sign the partnership deal with Walsh Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn&#39;s eyes darted around. She picked up on</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wie unspoken message, but her interpretation leaned a little different. So Haley got to the photos first, now she wanted Jazlyn to be the one to light the fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words had already reached Jazlyn&#39;s ears-Haley&#39;s mother, a major Walsh client, would be attending tonight&#39;s event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That settled it for Jazlyn. She believed she now fully understood Haley&#39;s agenda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Haley&#39;s hand a light pat, smiling with feigned warmth. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, dear. I get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes hardened with resolve. Haley wanted drama? Fine. It was just a matter of timing.And when those photos dropped-she would make sure it was unforgettable. She would handle it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two women exchanged a meaningful glance and headed into the banquet hall side by side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc, deep in conversation with an executive,caught sight of Jazlyn entering. His jaw clenched. What the hell is she doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He barely heard the man talking to him. Without hesitation, he cut the conversation short.&#34;Excuse me,&#34; he said stiffly and walked-away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stormed over to Jazlyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, what are you doing here?&#34; His voice was low but sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn saw the irritation brewing in his eyes-but she was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing Haley&#39;s wrist, she raised her voice-loud enough for the whole hall to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>、&#34;Why shouldn&#39;t I be here? Huh, Marc?&#34; she snapped. &#34;Let me tell you something-Stella&#39;s not worthy of you! She&#39;s been messing around with other men behind your back! Shameless woman! You need to divorce her right now,before she drags the Walsh name through the mud!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall fell into stunned silence. Gasps, wide eyes, and then the whispers began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley blinked in surprise. She&#39;d expected Jazlyn to start with the photo leak-not an all-out verbal assault. Still, she couldn&#39;t deny it-that was bold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jazlyn waited for Haley to follow through with the pictures. In that instant, MMarc&#39;s face darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice boomed, sharp and cutting. &#34;Mom,that&#39;s enough! What nonsense are you saying?&#34;</p>
