            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>The bold message read, &#34;I&#39;m in my room.Bring me something to eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked in disbelief, thinking she might&#39;ve misread it. But no-she double-checked the contact. It really was from William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he seriously expecting her to play room service? Did something happen to his legs or hands? Couldn&#39;t he grab his own food?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were just colleagues. It wasn&#39;t like she owed him anything. She wasn&#39;t his assistant,let alone his maid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And besides, didn&#39;t she see a plate of food in front of him during dinner? Didn&#39;t he eat his food?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she thought about it, the less sense it made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was tempted to ignore the message entirely, but after lying in bed for a while,she couldn&#39;t shake the unease gnawing at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was her direct superior at the research institute. If she ticked him off, what if he held it against her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did seem like someone who held grudges. They&#39;d already had a few awkward run-ins, and he clearly hadn&#39;t forgotten,especially that embarrassing shower incident...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just thinking about it made Stella shiver.With a sigh, she reluctantly climbed out of bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever. She wasn&#39;t going to stoop to his level. Delivering food wasn&#39;t a big deal.Twenty minutes tops, and she&#39;d be back under the covers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Laura came out from the bathroom with damp hair, Laura noticed her slipping on a coat and getting ready to leave. Her brows furrowed slightly. &#34;Stella? It&#39;s late-where are</p>
                
                
                
                <p>you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just a little hungry,&#34; Stella said casually.&#34;Heading to the cafeteria to see if there&#39;s anything left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, she opened the door and stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura watched the door close behind her,feeling a bit puzzled. Stella never ate this late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she really was hungrier than usual today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shrugging it off, Laura went back to her reading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Stella walked straight to the cafeteria. Luckily, they kept a few late-night snacks on hand. The options weren&#39;t impressive, but it was enough to satisfy a grown man&#39;s appetite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a tray of noodles and some sides in hand,she made her way toward Room 305.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she reached the door, she knocked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was already inside when he heard the knock, and he quickly got up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After messaging Stella, he&#39;d been sitting on the sofa, still wearing the same robe she&#39;d seen him in last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a mirror near the entrance, and as he walked over, he paused to check his reflection. He adjusted his collar slightly,making it look effortlessly relaxed, then casually opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swung open, and William&#39;s tall frame came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella&#39;s eyes darted up, caught a glimpse,then instantly looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he opening the door like that-half-dressed and showing off his chest?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s your food,&#34; she said quickly, holding the tray out to him. She wasn&#39;t planning to step inside and made sureto keep her eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>fixed on the tray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It might&#39;ve been quiet now, but who could say if someone would step out of his room?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Therefore, she wasn&#39;t gonna take any chances, especially not with Nathalia having confronted her earlier that day. The last thing she needed was to be caught at William&#39;s door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William let out a low chuckle, clearly amused by how she avoided looking at him. While accepting the food, he teased, &#34;What&#39;s got you flustered? It&#39;s not like you haven&#39;t seen it before. You were pretty fearless last time,weren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks heated up in embarrassment.This man really didn&#39;t let things go. He remembered everything!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a quick step back, she said, &#34;Okay,you&#39;ve got your food. I&#39;ll get going now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to leave, but before she could take another step, William caught her wrist from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the hurry?&#34; he said smoothly.&#34;Stay with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart gave a sudden jolt. What exactly was he trying to do now?</p>
