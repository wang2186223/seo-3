                <p>Marc looked the officer dead in the eye,frustration brimming in his voice. &#34;Let me out, or I&#39;ll have my lawyer contact you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officer didn&#39;t even flinch. &#34;You&#39;re welcome to call your lawyer, but it won&#39;t change the fact -you&#39;re not going anywhere tonight. You&#39;re under investigation for intellectual property infringement. The opposing company&#39;s already submitted evidence. Until we sort this out,you stay put.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the final nail in the coffin. Marc leaned back in the hard chair, jaw tight. He had planned to go find Stella, to talk to her, maybe even fix things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now? That hope was crushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make things worse, Jazlyn and Haley were still crying beside him. Their constant sniffles</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and dramatic sobs grated on his nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly slammed his hand on the table.&#34;Enough already! What are you even crying for?You two worked together to hurt Stella, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The outburst silenced them both. Jazlyn choked on her sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley glared at him, lips trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t get it. Why was everything going Stella&#39;s way? First, Stella married Marc. Then William showed up, practically shielding her from harm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley was almost certain William had intervened and ruined her entire plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was Stella always the lucky one? Why did men like Marc and William gravitate toward her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc-who used to be so gentle with Haley-had been cold and irritable with her all day. The injustice burned inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, the sun rose on what should&#39;ve been a milestone day at the institute -the start of the confidential research project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The institute&#39;s lobby buzzed with activity.Selected members stood with their luggage,excited and proud. Those not chosen came to see them off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella stood to one side, quietly watching it all.She was calm on the surface, but her eyes betrayed her disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d poured so much into this project, fully believing her skills and dedication would earn her a spot. But in the end, she had overestimated herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she could only watch the others chase a dream she thought would be hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her suitcase was already packed. Not for the project-but for something far more personal.She had made up her mind to step away and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>sort out the divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night&#39;s drama had drawn enough attention,and she needed space. She had already informed the institute of her planned leave.Her superiors didn&#39;t object. After the project team departed, she walked into the office and handed in her leave request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her supervisor looked at her kindly. &#34;Stella,sometimes a break is a good thing. Come back when you&#39;re ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced a smile and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The supervisor saw the disappointment lingering in her expression and patted her shoulder. &#34;Don&#39;t be too hard on yourself. There will always be other chances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; she said softly. &#34;I&#39;ll get going, then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging her suitcase behind her, she made her way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heading toward the exit of the institute, she saw</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey bursting in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey spotted her, sprinted over, and grabbed her hand, out of breath and wide-eyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella! Don&#39;t go out-Marc&#39;s at the institute gate. He&#39;s making a huge scene!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella froze.Marc?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With all the charges against him, how could he be out already?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he here because of what happened last night at the gala? Maybe he wanted to get back at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who knows what kind of tricks he pulled to get out so fast!&#34; Lainey muttered, clearly shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey didn&#39;t want Stella to go out. Marc had once hit her. Who knew what he was capable of now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a strong hand gripped the handle of Stella&#39;s suitcase and yanked it back.</p>
