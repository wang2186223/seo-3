                <p>Haley stood stiffly beside Marc, trying to make sense of what Steven had said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That outrageous compensation clause?Maybe-maybe-she could pull some strings with her father to cover it. But the rest? The cutting-edge tech Stella claimed to have?She had nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley&#39;s expression soured. She squeezed Marc&#39;s arm like a vice and shot Stella a venomous glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What new technology could you possibly have? Besides WAY2, what else is there? The Walsh Group already mastered WAY2. Don&#39;t talk big just to show off-you&#39;ll only dig your own grave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella looked at her like she was watching a toddler throw a tantrum in public.&#34;WAY2?&#34;she said, one brow raised. &#34;Miss Smith,are</p>
                
                
                
                <p>you sure that&#39;s the name? Because I think what you meant was WAY MORE-the upgraded version of the original WAY tech.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush fell over the small group. Haley&#39;s face flushed beet red. She&#39;d gotten the name wrong in front of everyone-a painfully obvious sign she had no idea what she was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was obviously big talk, a joke to everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her fists but said nothing.What could she say?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella turned back to Steven, her voice calm and steady. &#34;Mr. Harrison, WAY MORE dropped three years ago. It was groundbreaking at the time, sure-but three years is a lifetime in tech. If the Walsh Group is still peddling that, then that&#39;s honestly kind of sad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc stared at her under the dazzle of the chandelier, momentarily lost. The light danced on her skin, but it wasn&#39;t just the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>glow that struck him-it was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the six months since she vanished, she&#39;d transformed into someone else entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood taller, spoke sharper, moved like a woman who no longer second-guessed herself. Stronger. Smarter. Untouchably radiant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had she been up to for the past six months? Had she really emerged with brand-new technology in hand?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven&#39;s gaze lingered, his interest sharpening into something more serious. His admiration for Stella wasn&#39;t just growing-it was cementing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile deepened, and he turned back to Marc. &#34;So,Mr.Walsh? Anything to add?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s lips parted, but no words came out.He had nothing. Stella had walked out with her patent, and the Walsh Group hadn&#39;t produced anything worth bragging about since.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven gave a light clap, as if the performance was over. &#34;In that case, the project will go to Nebula. I trust you have no objections, Mr.Walsh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc stood frozen. He had just been publicly outmaneuvered. Again. He couldn&#39;t even deny it. He simply kept silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella didn&#39;t bother lingering either. She turned to leave without another glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Marc, clearly out of his depth, scrambled after her like a drowning man reaching for a lifeline. &#34;Stel-wait! Are you really working with Nebula? That company&#39;s brand new. It has no backing, no stability. You can&#39;t be serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ignored him completely, walking as if he didn&#39;t exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc wasn&#39;t ready to give up. &#34;Stel, don&#39;t do this. I know I messed up, okay? But you&#39;ve been gone for six months. You&#39;ve had time to cool off. Come home. You don&#39;t need to work for some unstable startup. Come back to the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walsh Group. It&#39;s your company too. You&#39;re my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Stella stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned around slowly, her tone razor-sharp. &#34;First of all-I am not your wife.Second-Nebula, even as a brand new company,just beat your Walsh Group in a fair bid. And third-you&#39;re clinging to outdated tech like it&#39;s some kind of achievement. Let me remind you-you lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s face turned a deep shade of crimson,but he swallowed his pride and tried again.&#34;Okay. Fine. Scold me all you want, I don&#39;t care. Just come back to me,okay? You want to stay at Nebula? Fine. I&#39;ll support it. I&#39;ll support anything. Just... don&#39;t shut me out like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella stared at him like he was speaking another language.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could reply, Steven reappeared at her side and casually laid a hand on Marc&#39;s shoulder. &#34;Mr. Walsh, I&#39;m going to stop you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>right there. We all know your wife disappeared six months ago. But that doesn&#39;t give you the right to claim a random woman as your spouse. That&#39;s called harassment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella gave Steven a sideways glance,gratitude flickering in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc clenched his jaw. &#34;You&#39;re wrong. She&#39;s not a random woman. She&#39;s Stella Russell.I know my own wife-l&#39;d never mistake her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven let out a short laugh. &#34;You must have incredible eyesight, then, because I&#39;m pretty sure the name on that ID wasn&#39;t Stella Russell. It was Sylvia Gilbert. You still think they&#39;re the same person?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That did it. The crowd, already whispering,broke out in a fresh wave of hushed giggles and scandalized murmurs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard about this. His wife left him after he cheated,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Men like him always come crawling back when it&#39;s too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t he show up with that other woman earlier? And now he&#39;s playing the heartbroken husband? Seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remarks stabbed Marc from every angle,but Steven wasn&#39;t done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Walsh,&#34; Steven said coolly, voice carrying through the murmuring crowd, &#34;a true gentleman doesn&#39;t harass a woman.Show a little class, will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc froze. That one sentence pinned him to the wall harder than any slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he kept pushing now, he wouldn&#39;t just lose face-he&#39;d confirm every whisper in the room that he was nothing more than a possessive fool, clinging to a woman who no longer belonged to him. And in Choria&#39;s elite circles, reputations didn&#39;t bend-they shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This would put Walsh Group in a bad light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at Steven, jaw clenched so tight it could&#39;ve cracked teeth. But the man standing before him wasn&#39;t just anyone-he</p>
                
                
                
                <p>was Steven Harrison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Marc swallowed his pride, forced a stiff nod, then turned to Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lingered-desperate, pleading, full of regret. But she didn&#39;t flinch. Without another word, he turned and walked out of the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haley, still reeling from the earlier humiliation, didn&#39;t dare stay a moment longer. She lifted her gown and scurried out after him. The spectacle was over. The ballroom slowly returned to its usual rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella let out a small breath and looked at Steven. &#34;Thanks for stepping in just now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven gave a lazy flick of his hand,lips curled into the faintest of smiles. &#34;Don&#39;t thank me,&#34; he said, eyes twinkling. &#34;I&#39;m not the one you should be thanking.&#34;</p>
