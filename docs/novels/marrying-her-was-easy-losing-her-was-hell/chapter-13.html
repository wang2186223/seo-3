                <p>It was William!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella blinked in surprise. What were the odds? How did he end up in the very car she thought she&#39;d booked?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Wiliam looked mildly taken aback, his one brow lifting with quiet curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking,she blurted out, &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William raised a brow, his tone dry and just slightly amused. &#34;Ms. Russell, if you needed a ride, my driver would&#39;ve been happy to take you. But climbing into my car like this? A bit bold, don&#39;t you think? Or is this a habit of yours-confusing cars...or people?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting his deep, unreadable gaze, Stella finally realized her mistake-she&#39;d entered the wrong car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t checked the plate-just saw the same model and color as the one she&#39;d booked and got in without thinking. She never expected to mess up like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, did he have to be so sharp-tongued about it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then again, thinking back, she did owe him an apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a breath, she composed herself. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, MMr.Briggs. I didn&#39;t realize this was your car. My mistake.I&#39;ll get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as her hand touched the door handle,William&#39;s voice stopped her. &#34;Wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned, puzzled. &#34;Yes, Mr. Briggs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d already apologized. Surely he wouldn&#39;t dwell on something this minor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze carried a quiet weight-so intense it felt suffocating,even though he hadn&#39;t raised his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he actually upset? Just because of this? Or was it something more?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William spoke in his usual calm, deliberate tone. &#34;I saw the note in the jacket you returned. Frankly, since l gave it to you, I wasn&#39;t expecting it back. Ms. Russell,I&#39;d rather you focus on your responsibilities. The least you can do is show some professionalism.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words caught her off guard. Did he really think she&#39;d left her number in some desperate attempt to flirt? That she got into his car today on purpose?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her mouth to explain, but he had already</p>
                
                
                
                <p>stepped out of the car,leaving her in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rose to Stella&#39;s cheeks. How could she even begin to explain that night? It was impulsive,thoughtless. Better left forgotten. Some things just couldn&#39;t be talked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped into the correct car this time and slumped into the back seat with a heavy sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she arrived at the research institute, she got straight to work, sorting through her things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, who was helping nearby, swung a cabinet door open and accidentally whacked the back of Stella&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella let out a cry, instinctively holding her head as dizziness swept over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alarmed, Lainey gently pulled her hand aside to take a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The area was red,alreadyswelling,with a few spots of blood seeping out-it looked worse than she expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey gasped. &#34;Oh no, Stella! That looks bad. We have to get you to a hospital now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stella winced but waved her off. &#34;It&#39;s okay, really. No need for the hospital. I&#39;ll be fine. And it&#39;s not your</p>
                
                
                
                <p>fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not her fault? Lainey hesitated, then remembered Stella had said she was going to see Marc earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression darkened. She grabbed Stella&#39;s shoulders. &#34;Tell me the truth. Did that scumbag Marc lay a hand on you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Stella had regained her balance, she quietly explained what had gone down at Marc&#39;s company.&#34;Lainey, don&#39;t stress. I promise it&#39;s not serious. I&#39;ll be fine in a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lainey wasn&#39;t pacified. She was fuming.&#34;Unbelievable! You&#39;re his wife-how dare he hit you over some other woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Lainey rage, Stella&#39;s lips tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, over another woman, her own husband had shoved her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had he turned into this kind of man?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or maybe... he&#39;d always been like this, and she&#39;d just been too blind to see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she stood lost in thought,her phone suddenly rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey glanced at the screen and scowled. It was Marc</p>
