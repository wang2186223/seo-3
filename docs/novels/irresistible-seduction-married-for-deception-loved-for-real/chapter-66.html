                <p>Hannah released her grip, and Danica stumbled back onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sneer, Danica tossed her damp hair over her shoulder. &#34;So this is what this is about? Standing up for your parents, I see.&#34; She rolled her eyes. &#34;Tell me,did I say anything that wasn&#39;t true? Your family&#39;s always had nothing. If it weren&#39;t for the Jones family,you&#39;d just keep sinking lower.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A steely coldness settled in Hannah&#39;s eyes.&#34;Appreciate the reminder. With the rest of your properties coming our way, it won&#39;t be long before the Scott family is swimming in wealth.&#34; After that,she settled herself in a chair and reached out her hand. &#34;Go on, hand over the remaining seven properties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica barely reacted. Instead, she raised her voice so everyone could hear. &#34;What&#39;s your hurry? Like I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>said before, handing over property doesn&#39;t happen in a snap. It&#39;s a process, you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but add in a mocking tone, &#34;And let&#39;s be real, with your family of bookworms, can any of you handle that much money? How about this-we compromise. Since you and Vincent are parting ways, let&#39;s keep things friendly. I&#39;ll wire you ten million. Think of it as a parting gift from me. Not too shabby, right?&#34; She flashed a broad, fake smile,acting as if she were being generous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold laugh escaped Hannah. Danica honestly believed ten million would be enough to settle this?All those properties together would easily top a billion. Clearly, Danica was only dragging things out-she couldn&#39;t bear to hand over the assets she&#39;d invested her year-long savings in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely not,&#34; Hannah said, her voice firm. &#34;I want every single property you promised. Nothing less.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s features tightened, and her words turned sharp. &#34;Then there&#39;s nothing else to discuss. I&#39;ve already told you, the transfer takes time. If you want Refusing to let her off the hook, Hannah spelled out the real problem. &#34;You&#39;re not dragging this out because of any paperwork. You just can&#39;t stand to let go of the properties. You call yourself part of a rich family? You&#39;re stingy, and your promises mean nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; Danica stammered, at a loss for any real comeback. Determined not to back down, she steadied herself. &#34;Say whatever you like. I&#39;ve already explained that the transfer will take time. If you refuse to wait, that&#39;s not my fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah narrowed her eyes. &#34;Well, if that&#39;s how it is...&#34;She glanced toward the doorway and said,&#34;You can come in now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An attorney, smartly dressed and holding a thick stack of files, entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of alarm crossed Danica&#39;s features.&#34;What are you playing at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah responded without a hint of hesitation, &#34;I asked my attorney to come here for a reason. Since you&#39;re too busy to process the transfers, I&#39;ve handled everything for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking the stack of files, Hannah gave them a small wave in Danica&#39;s direction. &#34;There are seven contracts right here, not a single one missing. All you have to do is sign. That way, we stop wasting each other&#39;s time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica erupted with outrage. &#34;This is blackmail!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A humorless chuckle escaped Hannah. &#34;You&#39;re something else. You broke your promise and then accuse me of blackmail? Who was it that said-loud and clear-that as long as | divorced Vincent, you&#39;d transfer ten properties into my name? I&#39;ve already signed the divorce agreement. Now you want to wriggle out of it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing herself to appear calm, Danica clung to the hope that Hannah would not dare to push too hard. &#34;I told you l&#39;d give you the properties, and I will,&#34; she replied slowly. &#34;Just leave the paperwork here.After Sharon&#39;s birthday is over, I&#39;ll take care of the signatures. Is that fair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah smirked. &#34;That almost sounds reasonable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief crept onto Danica&#39;s face. She thought she had managed to buy herself a little more time. Every minute she kept those properties in her name felt like a small victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her mouth to say something, but Hannah&#39;s tone turned cold. &#34;But I&#39;m done waiting. If you&#39;re so unwilling to hand over the properties, just sell them off and give me the cash instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A burst of anger shot through Danica. &#34;Have you lost your mind, Hannah? How am I supposed to come up with more than a billion in cash?&#34; All of her wealth was tied up in property.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her arms crossed, Hannah kept her tone sharp as ice. &#34;It looks like you have no choice but to sign right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flickered across Danica&#39;s face. &#34;I already told you, after Sharon&#39;s birthday, I&#39;ll sign everything.That&#39;s my word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A steady resolve colored Hannah&#39;s answer. &#34;And I already made it clear-I won&#39;t be waiting any longer.&#34;Her words came out quietly, but there was no room for argument. &#34;Did you think I couldn&#39;t tell you were just playing for time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold scoff escaped Hannah&#39;s lips. &#34;I only went along with your little game. You actually thought I believed it? And don&#39;t even try to accuse me of blackmail. Every one of these contracts says the transfer is a voluntary gift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, and the lawyer, who had stayed quietly nearby, stepped up to arrange the contracts on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica recoiled, taking a shaky step back. &#34;Don&#39;t you dare force me to sign!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s expression didn&#39;t budge. &#34;I&#39;m simply collecting what you promised me. What&#39;s so wrong with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Defiance crept into Danica&#39;s voice. &#34;I refuse to sign!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Hannah calmly drew two more documents from her bag and set them beside the contracts.&#34;These are my divorce agreements with Vincent. If you don&#39;t sign, I&#39;ll just tear these up instead.&#34;</p>
