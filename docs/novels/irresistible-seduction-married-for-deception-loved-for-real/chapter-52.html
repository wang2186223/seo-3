                <p>Once Hannah slipped into her pajamas, she clicked into the legal documents her attorney had emailed,diving into every page with a careful eye. She had asked for legal advice specifically regarding her dispute with Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was fully absorbed in the document,her phone buzzed with breaking news alerts.</p>

                <p>Hannah couldn&#39;t quite describe the feeling that rose in her chest. Numb, she tapped into the sea of comments below the headline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only two hours back, a swarm of strangers had come to her defense. But now, those same voices hurled insults. They called her shameless. Labeled her a gold digger. Accused her of chasing wealth just for appearances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing about their judgment fazed Hannah. Worse had been said right to her face by people in Vincent&#39;s circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back on the trending tab, she saw that every trace of her spat with Brinley had quietly disappeared. No wonder Vincent was so eager to compensate her.The villa offer and the sudden generosity all served one purpose: smoothing things over for this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter sat on the edge of her lips, but no sound came. Scrolling further, she spotted a grainy paparazzi photo-Brinley and Vincent, caught in a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with her heart locked away, Hannah felt it stumble. Time and again, Vincent had claimed there was nothing between him and Brinley. Still, one look at that intimate photograph was enough to unravel every assurance he&#39;d given.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, it all made sense-why V/incent insisted on keeping their marriage under wraps. He had always loved Brinley. He only ever wanted to go public with Brinley. Being the secret spouse meant she was never meant for the spotlight. She was the hidden</p>
