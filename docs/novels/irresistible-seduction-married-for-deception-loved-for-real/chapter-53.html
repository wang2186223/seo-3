                <p>Chapter.Easily erased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word,Hannah pressed save on the photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the night, sleep refused to come, no matter how many times she closed her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was the flood of posts and comments she&#39;d read. Old memories mingled with fresh wounds,dragging her mind back to her earlier days with Vincent. While she&#39;d been the understudy in his story, there had been sweet moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night Vincent proposed, he had transformed a glass conservatory with a sea of yellow roses-her favorite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had been a time when he&#39;d mark her calendar,cancel business flights across the world,simply because she begged him to stay. He&#39;d pull her close,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>pressing his palms to her aching stomach and trying to soothe the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Six months into their marriage, they had moved into their new home, Lakeshore Villa, miles from the Jones family estate, all to protect her from Danica&#39;s spite. At the doorway, Vincent had remarked, &#34;This is our home.&#34; That simple line... It was the most heartfelt thing he&#39;d ever said to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the first year in their new home, he&#39;d bring her fresh flowers every night he came home.She&#39;d saved most of them, letting them dry until they became keepsakes of something gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spare hours had brought spontaneous tripS-snowfall in winter, shimmering lakes in summer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In moments of passion, he&#39;d pull her close, call her &#34;baby&#34; or &#34;Anna,&#34; and insist on exploring every way they could be close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, happiness had slipped away far too soon. Vincent&#39;s schedule had grown increasingly packed, and his presence at home had gradually become a rare occurrence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were days when Hannah searched every room,only to discover he was gone. Maybe that was when Brinley came back into the picture. Perhaps that was when Vincent&#39;s attention drifted for good. The substitute had served her purpose, and he was done pretending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking back, Hannah could only taste the ache of old memories. Maybe the only reason he&#39;d ever treated her well was because he saw someone else in her. Real or fake, the truth felt impossible to untangle. Who could say how much of his past affection had actually belonged to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sleep barely touched Hannah that night, with thoughts tumbling endlessly through her mind.Exhaustion clung to her by sunrise, leaving her heavy-eyed and hollow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, the dining room buzzed with Danica&#39;s laughter as she scrolled her phone, nibbling at her breakfast as if nothing in the world could bother her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a bright grin, Danica pressed play on Brinley&#39;s voice message for all to hear. &#34;That&#39;s a relief, Brinley.Vincent must really care about you,&#34; she said, her voice full of delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of Hannah on the staircase, Danica&#39;s smile disappeared, her eyes sharpening with contempt. &#34;So you actually managed to sleep while the whole internet tore you apart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah shot Danica a sideways glance and asked the housekeeper for some porridge. Her tone was calm as she replied to Danica. &#34;Why would that be your concern?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the attitude you&#39;re going with?&#34; Danica snapped, smacking her spoon against the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pointing an accusing finger, Danica&#39;s voice grew shrill. &#34;If Brinley hadn&#39;t told me, I&#39;d never have known how low you&#39;d sink! Airing out private messages online, just to make yourself look better? Have you no shame?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night, Danica had gone to bed early and missed all the online drama, only to wake up and find Brinley the sudden darling of public opinion. Eager for the story, she&#39;d immediately called Brinley and gotten an earful about Hannah&#39;s so-called manipulations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting Danica&#39;s triumphant stare, Hannah answered with a cold glare of her own, &#34;If anyone here should be ashamed, it&#39;s Brinley. Not me.&#34;</p>
