                <p>Felix looked up as soon as Hannah stepped inside his office, and his words came out sharp with sarcasm.&#34;The full-time housewife decided to show up and watch us fall apart? Sorry, I have work to do. Don&#39;t have time to entertain you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix had a good reason to nurture displeasure toward Hannah. Back when the company had been a huge success with orders coming in faster than they could deal with, Hannah had walked away without even glancing back, and nobody had been able to make her stay. And in the five years since, she hadn&#39;t contacted anyone from the company-not even once. So seeing her now, he didn&#39;t bother to mince his words or mask his true feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry for my past absence,&#34; Hannah said, voice soft as she lowered her gaze. &#34;I only came hoping to find out if there&#39;s anything I can do to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold, bitter laugh escaped Felix. &#34;Oh, are you done playing the perfect housewife behind closed doors?Thought you&#39;d swing by and save us now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tossed a folder onto the floor, the sound sharp in the quiet room. The glare in his eyes said it all. &#34;It&#39;s too late. We don&#39;t need your help. The company&#39;s finished.You happy now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath to steady herself, Hannah answered in an even tone, &#34;Felix, I understand that you&#39;re upset. But we should focus on solving the company crisis right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger filled his voice. &#34;We&#39;re on the brink of bankruptcy. What the hell can a full-time housewife like you do to change anything?&#34; He didn&#39;t bother to wait for a reply, already gathering his things like he was leaving for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw clenched. Emotion flickered in her eyes. After a moment, she spoke. &#34;I&#39;m getting divorced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix stood frozen, disbelief written across his face.&#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If things unfold the way I expect, I&#39;ll walk away with a solid payout,&#34; she said, drawing out each word.&#34;So...&#34; Reaching out her hand, she finished her thought. &#34;So, what do you think? Want to bring our business back to life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah made her way out of the company with a stack of documents, all provided by Felix, for her to grasp the company&#39;s crisis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, once home, as she nudged her room door open, she froze. Right there, on her bed, lay Brinley,tucked into Vincent&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill swept through Hannah, leaving her numb.Suddenly, a laugh escaped her lips-not from amusement, but from her shattered heart and simmering fury. Vincent really couldn&#39;t help himself,could he? He was cheating in their house now? Or perhaps he just liked the thrill of being caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&lt;</p>
