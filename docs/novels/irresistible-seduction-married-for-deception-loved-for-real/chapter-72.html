                <p>By the time the clock struck four, professionals from every corner of the business world had started filling Cloudspire Center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trailing after Rena and her father, Hannah found herself introduced to several key players from various industries. She understood well that most were only willing to exchange polite greetings because of the influence wielded by Brown Bank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with that knowledge, Hannah treasured this opportunity. This evening marked the first time she&#39;d truly seen how different this crowd was from her old life as a housewife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With steady confidence, Hannah remarked, &#34;Nova Tech will be a name everyone knows one day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing around the hall, she noticed plenty of skeptical and dismissive looks aimed her way. None of it bothered her, since she understood that this was just something she had to face. She quietly raised her champagne and took a sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, a woman&#39;s voice cut through the noise. &#34;Beautifully said.&#34; Her glass lifted in Hannah&#39;s direction, a warm smile on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s gaze traveled upward, just as Rena leaned in and whispered, &#34;That&#39;s Ms. Sloane Hadley-she&#39;s famous in the world of industrial business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving through the crowd, Sloane&#39;s words carried both strength and encouragement. &#34;I always appreciate the ambitious type.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah was a little caught off guard by the praise. &#34;Thank you, Ms. Hadley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a pat on Hannah&#39;s shoulder, Sloane suggested, &#34;Let&#39;s swap numbers. I want to know about Nova Tech.Your company seems promising.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right away, Hannah reached for her phone and exchanged contacts with Sloane, pleasantly surprised.Sloane was the first major figure she had connected with this evening. She lifted her glass once more.&#34;Thank you, Ms. Hadley. I promise you, Nova Tech will live up to your expectations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the way Sloane welcomed Hannah, Rena could not hide her excitement. She clinked glasses with her friend several times, happy for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that very moment, commotion broke out near the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing in the direction of the uproar, Hannah spotted a man at the center-Miles had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd, instantly drawn to Miles, gathered in close, eager for his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah didn&#39;t even try to push through. She held back, fully aware of her place in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena glanced over and suddenly brightened, as if an idea struck her. She leaned close and whispered,&#34;Hannah, have you ever wondered why someone like Miles would bother coming to an event like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s brow furrowed in confusion. &#34;Isn&#39;t this a business event? Since he&#39;s a big name now, I figured it made sense for him to be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not it at all,&#34; Rena replied, shaking her head. &#34;Usually, people like him would never show up for a minor gathering like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping her voice even lower, Rena continued,&#34;My dad told mne Miles is actually here because of Victoria-the founder behind that women&#39;s empowerment website. Five years ago, she created those sonic self-defense earrings that sold like crazy-no one&#39;s topped those sales since. My dad&#39;s tried recruiting her for ages, but Victoria remained elusive and hard to reach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A part of Hannah wanted to admit she was actually Victoria right then. It wasn&#39;t exactly a secret worth guarding anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could say a word, a spotlight swept over the main stage, and the evening&#39;s host stepped up,script in hand. &#34;Ladies and gentlemen,&#34; the host announced, his voice echoing through the room. &#34;I know you have all been eagerly awaiting Victoria Hale. She&#39;s arrived backstage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s gaze grew colder, fixed on the center of the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host lifted his voice with flair and instructed the crowd, &#34;It&#39;s time to put your hands together for Victoria Hale!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena clutched Hannah&#39;s hand in excitement.&#34;Oh my god!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lights shifted overhead as applause filled the hall. A woman in a white dress walked out, beaming,her arm entwined with a sharply dressed man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah and Rena both froze in shock when they saw Brinley&#39;s face.</p>
