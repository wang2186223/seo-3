                <p>Private jet engines hummed beneath Vincent&#39;s feet as he prepared for takeoff, focused on making it home in time for the family lunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley, however, wasn&#39;t in the best mood. Anxiously,she tapped her phone again and again, refreshing her email in anticipation. Only the night before, she&#39;d pulled strings and spent a significant sum to contact a prestigious hospital. Finally, the awaited reply illuminated her screen, making her heart skip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning excitement, she leaned over and shook Vincent&#39;s shoulder. &#34;Vincent! The doctor finally replied!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had barely slept over the past two days, having worked around the clock to close the acquisition deal. Being abruptly shaken awake, his eyes darkened with fatigue and annoyance. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to sound as bright as possible, Brinley explained, &#34;I&#39;ve been reaching out to top heart specialists in Calveria. One of them just emailed me.They&#39;re willing to see me for a consultation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s brow furrowed, still half-asleep. &#34;Right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but I know you promised your grandmother lunch,&#34; she said, biting her lip. &#34;Really, don&#39;t let me keep you. I can go alone if I have to. Family should come first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words dripped with self-sacrifice, as though she was letting him off the hook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For several moments, Vincent sat in silence,deliberating.Decision made, he spoke to the captain.&#34;Change our course. We&#39;re heading to the hospital.&#34;Turning to Brinley, his voice was gentle. &#34;Your health is more important than anything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He figured a meal at home could always be postponed. This appointment, on the other hand,might be a rare opportunity. He couldn&#39;t afford to let  anything happen to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfaction flashed in Brinley&#39;s eyes. She wasted no time sending a triumphant message to Hannah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the Jones estate, following Sharon&#39;s harsh rebuke, Danica grew quiet, seeking comfort in another glass of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With gracious warmth, Sharon smoothed over the earlier unpleasantness, ensuring Raymond and Margaret felt welcome. The meal soon settled into a peaceful rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time dessert was served, one chair remained conspicuously empty. Raymond finally spoke up. &#34;ls Vincent not joining us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s hands fidgeted in her lap. Uncertanty clouded her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting her silverware aside, Sharon stood and offered a reassuring smile. &#34;Let me see what&#39;s keeping him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before stepping away, Sharon caught Hannah&#39;s eye.&#34;Hannah, just make sure your parents are comfortable and have everything they need. No need to treat us with such formality.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Hannah nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Hannah turned to ask if her parents wanted anything else to eat, a sharp laugh cut through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s voice rang out, dripping with scorn. &#34;Do you really believe you&#39;re worthy of meeting Vincent? Just look at yourself-this wvhole thing is laughable.&#34; She took another deep swig from her glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a steely glare, Hannah signaled to the staff.&#34;She&#39;s clearly had too much. Please take her upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; Obediently, two maids moved forward to help, but Danica jerked free, bristling. &#34;I&#39;m not drunk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glare from Danica pinned the staff in place. &#34;Think twice before you listen to Hannah. If you want to keep your jobs, don&#39;t take orders from her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two maids didn&#39;t dare to move, tension crackling in the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her voice for everyone to hear,Danica stood tall. &#34;Since we&#39;re all gathered here,let me finally say what&#39;s been on my mind.&#34; Every eye in the room was on her as she spat out, &#34;Your daughter, Hannah,is nothing more than a cheap knockoff-gaudy, tacky,and embarrassing for anyone to be seen with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret&#39;s hands balled into tight fists at her sides,all the warmth she&#39;d felt from chatting with Sharon earlier draining away in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of teaching had trained Raymond to hold his tongue, but humiliation burned on his face as he tossed back his wine, silent and furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah hurried to her parents, her worry growing as she saw her father&#39;s composure slipping. &#34;She&#39;s just drunk,&#34; she said softly. &#34;Please don&#39;t mind her.Normally... She&#39;s not like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attempting to diffuse the situation, Hannah tried to guide Danica away from the table, only to be pushed aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s eyes narrowed in contempt. &#34;You think I wanted my son to marry her? Please. Your daughter was the one clinging to hm like a desperate hooker!When she first married into our family, she atleast knew her place, quiet, obedient, never making trouble. But now? She&#39;s mouthy and impossible to control. Thank goodness the marriage stayed under wraps. If anyone found out the great Jones family was linked to someone like her, we&#39;d be a laughingstock!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her contempt on Raymond and Margaret,Danica added, &#34;And you two, really, you really think you&#39;re fit to be related to the Jones family? Don&#39;t make me laugh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp gesture from her summoned the housekeeper. &#34;Aubrey, scrub everything down after this. I want no trace of their poverty clinging to my dining room. Even the air feels dirty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coldness in Hannah&#39;s face deepened, but before she could respond, a glass of wine sailed across the table, landing squarely on Danica and soaking her dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps echoed. Margaret, normally so gentle, had hurled it without a moment&#39;s hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, even Hannah was speechless-she had never seen her mother so fierce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raymond stared at his wife, wide-eyed. Decades together, and he&#39;d never seen her lose control like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica erupted, shouting, &#34;How dare you! What gives you the right to throw wine at me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret met Danica&#39;s glare head-on, her voice ringing with conviction. &#34;You deserve that throw,&#34; she declared, fury sharp in her eyes. &#34;Back home, I don&#39;t even let my daughter do chores, but here, you treat her as if she&#39;s beneath you. You&#39;ve gone way too far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning closer, Margaret gave an exaggerated sniff, a look of disdain curling her lips. &#34;Funny, no matter how much perfume you wear, it can&#39;t mask that foul stench every time you open your mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica bristled, words tumbling in disbelief. &#34;You-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, save it,&#34; Margaret snapped. &#34;You think we&#39;re beneath you? Well, guess what? We look down on you too. A so-called prestigious family that treats their daughter-in-law like a servant? I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if your family business hits a dead end soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scream erupted as Danica lunged, wild and furious,grabbing for Margaret&#39;s hair. &#34;How dare you! I&#39;Il tear you apart!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Margaret side-stepped with surprising speed,not even ruffled. &#34;Tear me apart? You&#39;d have to catch me first. Honestly, I&#39;d rather be anywhere but this miserable house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crashing against the table, Danica yelped in pain,but Margaret didn&#39;t even look back. Both Hannah and Raymond stood in shock, unsure how to process the  scene they&#39;d just witnessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A swirl of emotions knotted Hannah&#39;s chest as she realized her mother had stood up for her. Never in her life had she seen her mother&#39;s sudden fierceness, so unyielding in the face of cruelty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret grabbed Hannah&#39;s hand and turned to Raymond, all business. &#34;Well? Are you coming, or do you want to stay and be humiliated a minute longer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raymond, trying to stay rational, stopped her for a second. &#34;Aren&#39;t we waiting for Vincent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shake of Margaret&#39;s head made her answer clear.&#34;After all that? What&#39;s the point?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right,&#34; Raymond muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With barely another glance at the house, the three of them left together, heads high and backs unbowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Sharon hurried back into the dinìng room, the guests were gone, and Danica lay slumped at the table, reeking of wine and defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, Hannah placed a quick call to Sharon to explain the abrupt departure and then drove her parents straight to the train station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No amount of gentle pleading from Hannah could change her parents&#39; minds. Both Raymond and Margaret were set on leaving Dorbarrow behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s heart felt heavy with regret. She knew she hadn&#39;t protected her parents from disappointment.Her thoughts swirled with self-reproach and sadness, but then a familiar voice broke through the haze. &#34;Mrs. Jones, I finally managed to catch up with you.&#34;</p>
