                <p>Once again, the conversation circled back to Felix.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No energy remained in Hannah for explanations.Keeping her gaze on the floor, she retorted, &#34;What if it is? Having a child with Felix is certainly better than with you. At least he&#39;s emotionally stable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold shadow crossed Vincent&#39;s face. He parted his lips to speak, but nothing came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah was fully aware her answer would cut deep.She didn&#39;t care. Vincent&#39;s mind had already made up its own story-he was sure she&#39;d slept with Felix.Justifying herself felt pointless. The end of their marriage was near. He could believe whatever nonsense he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her dress torn beyond repair, Hannah walked into the walk-in closet to hunt for anything remotely presentable. A random pair of pants was all she bothered to grab before slipping them on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uneasy silence stretched between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emerging from the closet, she found Vincent perched on the edge of the bed, shirt half-unbuttoned, cigarette between his fingers, smoke curling upward in lazy spirals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as his eyes caught hers, he crushed the burning tip between his fingertips, snuffing it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a flicker of emotion crossed Hannah&#39;s face as she shot him a cool, indifferent look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she strode for the exit. Her hand barely brushed the doorknob before Vincent&#39;s voice stopped her. &#34;Hannah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to react, she pushed the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could leave, Vincent moved to block her path. &#34;Didn&#39;t you see anything different about this room?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her response was flat. &#34;I noticed. What of it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The change hadn&#39;t escaped her attention the moment she entered. Walls, furniture, every detail had returned to their original design-except for the missing crib in the corner. None of it meant.anything to her. For all she knew, Vincent could have done it to please Brinley. Perhaps Brinley&#39;s taste ran just as minimalist and elegant as her own. There was no way it was meant for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley must be on your mind a lot,&#34; Hannah remarked, delivering the observation with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown creased Vincent&#39;s brow. &#34;This has nothing to do with Brinley. I reset the room for you, and you&#39;re still not happy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp, mocking laugh escaped Hannah. For her?Yeah,like she would believe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one firm motion, she tried to push Vincent aside. &#34;Out of the way. I&#39;m sleeping in the guest room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow fell over Vincent&#39;s expression. &#34;I went out of my way to change this room&#39;s decoration back just because of your complaints, and yet you&#39;re not A pulsing vein stood out on his forehead. &#34;Grandma&#39;s birthday is around the corner. Are you planning to stay angry with me until then? It&#39;s been days, and your outburst should have a limit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An icy wave ran through Hannah. He had no real grasp of what this room represented in their lives. No -what it meant to her. In his mind, a little redecorating should magically erase all the damage.But some things can&#39;t be fixed by rolling back the clock. And worse, he always thought it was her problem. To him, she was just throwing a tantrum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A biting, cold laugh slipped past Hannah&#39;s lips.&#34;Exactly! I just always throw a wobbly. If it&#39;s such a problem, then stop dragging it out-just divorce me.Brinley can move right into this newly decorated room. You can put that missing crib back in the corner, and the two of you can-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hannah Scott!&#34; Vincent interjected with a sharp,urgent shout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her jaw. &#34;What, did I strike a nerve?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, they&#39;d reached a standoff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand shot out, aiming to get around him. But Vincent wouldn&#39;t let her pass. &#34;I redecorated everything in here for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah looked at him, her gaze steady and emotionless. &#34;Maybe you did it for me, but where were you before any of this? Is patching things up after the damage was caused the only way you know? Some things, once they&#39;re broken, never go back to how they were-no matter what you fix. This room looks like before, but it doesn&#39;t feel like home.Some changes can&#39;t be reversed, Vincent, even if you try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Much like her relationship with Vincent, once something was wrecked, it could never truly go back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With barely any effort, Hannah brushed him aside.&#34;I&#39;ll take the guest room. This place doesn&#39;t feel like mine anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent watched Hannah&#39;s resolute silhouette,feeling the distance between them growing with every step she took. Defeat weighing him down, he wandered back inside the room and sparked a new cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Hannah sat alone in the guest room,swallowing a contraceptive pill before pulling the covers over herself and willing her mind to shut off.</p>
