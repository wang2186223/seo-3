                <p>A dark storm gathered in Vincent&#39;s eyes. &#34;Don&#39;t bring up Brinley,&#34; he snapped, voice as cold as ice. The warning in his tone was unmistakable. &#34;She would never speak to me the way you do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only silence followed until Hannah broke it with a bitter, mocking laugh, retreating a step. &#34;If that&#39;s the case, go to her. What&#39;s the point of coming boack here at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s expression tightened, lines deepening between his brows. &#34;Is it really necessary for you to talk like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharp defiance glinted in Hannah&#39;s eyes. &#34;I&#39;ve always talked like this. If you can&#39;t take it, just divorce me already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of fury flashed across his face. &#34;How many times do I have to tell you? Don&#39;t bring up divorce again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He studied her, noticing the way she seemed fixated on ending things lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away, Hannah made it clear she was done arguing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flick of his cuffs signaled his impatience as he shifted topics. &#34;What you did with Brinley-don&#39;t let it happen again. Your post could make her condition worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arms folded, Hannah&#39;s laugh was hollow and sharp.She had just believed he wasn&#39;t here to defend Brinley. How foolish of her. Of course, everything came back to Brinley. That was always the reason.Vincent had only come home to defend Brinley. The truth stung-to him, she was just a stand-in, never the real thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger twisted inside Hannah, threatening to spill over. Why did she have to suffer just because Brinley was sick?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hard, unflinching smile broke across Hannah&#39;s face. &#34;Vincent, let&#39;s get one thing straight. Brinley apologized to me. And what I say in response to that apology is none of your business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A muscle in Vincent&#39;s jaw jumped, his eyes darkening further.&#34;And you had to pick a fight with her on the internet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think whatever you want,&#34; Hannah replied, voice icy. His disapproval was obvious, but she didn&#39;t care.She wasn&#39;t going to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension pressed in from all sides until Vincent&#39;s phone abruptly began to ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sideways glance from Hannah caught the name flashing on the screen-Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second&#39;s hesitation, Vincent answered,his tone softening instantly. On the other end, Brinley&#39;s sweet, trembling voice complained of feeling unwell and wanting to see him as soon as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent glanced at Hannah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah nodded as she thought she got his message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started to walk out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But abruptly, Vincent stepped in before she could go any farther. He grabbed her wrist, refusing to let her slip away. She pulled and twisted, trying to break loose, but his grip held firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no choice, Hannah endured the next thirty minutes listening to Vincent&#39;s low, soothing words as he comforted Brinley-every phrase another twist of the knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call ended, Hannah finally managed to wrench her arm away with force. Rubbing the angry red mark on her wrist, she glared at him. &#34;Whatever goes on between you and Brinley is your business.I don&#39;t care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s gaze flicked to her wrist, now visibly red.A brief shadow crossed his face. Silence hung for a moment before his voice dropped to something almost gentle. &#34;Delete that post.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah blinked, taken aback. Was he really asking this now?</p>

                <p>Stern lines deepened around Vincent&#39;s mouth. &#34;I just got word-Brinley&#39;s heart rate spiked because of the comment section of your post. If anything happens to her, you&#39;ll be the one to blame. Delete the post.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A defiant spark lit in Hannah&#39;s eyes. &#34;No. I won&#39;t delete it,&#34; she replied, voice steady and strong. This was justice she fought for-no way in hell was she backing down now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;Brinley has already apologized. Isn&#39;t that enough for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not nearly enough,&#34; Hannah replied, folding her arms tightly. &#34;A single apology won&#39;t fix what she did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thick silence grew between them, bristling with resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without warning, Vincent lunged forward and snatched her phone right off the vanity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah darted forward, voice sharp. &#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he had the height advantage. One arm easily held her back as he unlocked her phone with practiced ease. Within seconds, he located the post and deleted it without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone was thrust back into her hand, his words cutting and final. &#34;It&#39;s gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Hannah was too stunned to move.Then,fury overtook her, and she kicked him hard in the shin. &#34;You had no right! That wasn&#39;t yours!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage made her whole body shake as she struggled to catch her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s eyes slid away, his tone flat and distant.&#34;This ends now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calm on the surface, his words sliced right through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to break, Hannah tipped her head back,willing the tears not to fall-not ove him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tense swallow was the only sign of his discomfort.After a heavy pause, he said, &#34;I&#39;ll transfer the Lakeshore Villa into your name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like I want it,&#34; she replied. Her voice was cool,detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away, she made for the door-but Vincent&#39;s grip landed on her wrist again. &#34;It&#39;s settled, then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No room for argument lingered in the air. The meaning was clear: this was nothing more than a transaction. Another attempt to solve everything with money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was always Vincent&#39;s way-gift-wrapped solutions, money in place of real apologies. Once, it had been jewelry or handbags. Now, it wasproperty,meant to buy Hannah&#39;s silence about Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weariness replaced the anger in Hannah&#39;s chest. If this was how he wanted to end things, by paying her off, she&#39;d take it. After everything, he owed her at least that much. She drew herself up, eyes fierce and unyielding. &#34;Then make it cash. I want nothing with your name on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tug at his loosened tie was his only reaction.&#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No further words passed between them as Vincent walked out the door, destination obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew exactly where he was going. But she didn&#39;t have the energy to care. He always sought Brinley out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glance at her phone showed the hour: midnight.Eleven days remained. After that, she would leave his world entirely.</p>
