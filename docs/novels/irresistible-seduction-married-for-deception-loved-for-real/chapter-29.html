                <p>Sharon gave Vincent a worried look. &#34;I know work keeps you busy, but your health should come first.You need to look after yourself, Vincent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent offered a quick reassurance. &#34;I will,Grandma.&#34; Yet, his gaze drifted to Hannah instead of Sharon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica didn&#39;t look pleased. She hated hearing anyone suggest her son might have any shortcomings. She hissed, &#34;Have you no shame,Hannah? How can you talk about something so personal in front of everyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were the one who brought it up,&#34; Hannah answered, her tone even.only explained why there hasn&#39;t been a pregnancy. If you didn&#39;t want the answer, you shouldn&#39;t have asked. Honestly, I don&#39;t care to talk about it either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica sputtered, caught off guard. Hannah had become far bolder lately, never biting her tongue anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Danica kept telling herself he would only need to tolerate Hannah for a little while longer. Ten more days, at most. She clung to her authority. For now she could still give orders. She shifted her tone and yelled at Hannah, &#34;Go clean out the attic after breakfast!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew that old attic was filled with clutter.Danica just wanted to give Hannah a hard time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s reply was flat and direct. &#34;No. I&#39;m not here to play maid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last two days, while things were icy between Vincent and Hannah, Danica was eager to pile on more chores, but Hannah refused to do any of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica rolled her eyes. &#34;Really? All I asked was to move some boxes. Is that such a burden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting her spoon down, Hannah flashed a dry smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. I&#39;m much too delicate for that. I can&#39;t handle heavy lifting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are absolutely the wrong kind of person to marry into the Jones family!&#34; Danica slammed her hand down hard on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah retorted, &#34;If being your daughter-in-law means I&#39;m just a servant, then I don&#39;t want the role at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension filled the room. Danica drew a breath to argue, but Sharon spoke up. &#34;Enough, both of you.Can we please finish breakfast without turning it into a fight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica tried to justify herself. &#34;She doesn&#39;t show me any respect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon said calmly,&#34;And you haven&#39;t exactly shown her much respect either. Giving her chores? That was out of line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once upon a time, Sharon had managed the entire household on her own-her voice still commanded</p>
                
                
                
                <p>attention. Just a few words from her were enough to put Danica in her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody else dared to direct another comment at Hannah for the remainder of breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meal, Vincent fixed his mother with a stern look. &#34;Stop ordering Hannah around like she&#39;s just the help. She&#39;s my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning to her room, Hannah settled at her desk and began sketching a floral brooch for Sharon&#39;s birthday celebration. She had never studied design formally, but she picked up drawing for Vincent&#39;s sake. She had already settled on the gladiolus. Its symbolism of honor and strength felt like a fitting way to celebrate Sharon&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So deep in concentration, Hannah barely noticed when the door opened. Vincent leaned in close,curiosity clear on his face. &#34;What are you working on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, she quickly pulled the sketchbook away.&#34;Nothing important. Shouldn&#39;t you be at the office?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She only wanted him out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand slipped up her skirt. &#34;No stamina, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah swatted his hand away and stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent pressed her gently against the wall, turning the lock on the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her hands against his chest to create some distance and asked, &#34;What&#39;s gotten into you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want to show you there&#39;s nothing wrong with my stamina,&#34; he replied, his grin growing wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to push him away.are you out of your mind? It&#39;s the middle of the day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So?&#34; He dipped his head and kissed her without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah clamped her mouth shut and pushed against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent kissed her hard, insistent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fought back, but for a split second, she faltered and he took his chance. His tongue chased hers,relentless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornered, Hannah bit his lip, leaving the taste of blood between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He jerked back,startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of mischief danced in Hannah&#39;s eyes as she wiped her mouth. &#34;Vincent, your kissing skills have gotten worse.&#34;</p>
