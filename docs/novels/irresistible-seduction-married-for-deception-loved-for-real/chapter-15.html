            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Broken glass sparkled across the polished floor,glinting in the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent arrived at the scene in seconds, dropping to Brinley&#39;s side and helping her up without hesitation.A grimace flickered on his face as he noticed her hand, bloody and riddled wvith shards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That moment of concern for Brinley wasn&#39;t lost on Hannah. Something heavy and cold settled deep inside her. Pushing through the pain, she pulled herself to her feet unaided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can someone explain what happened?&#34; Vincent&#39;s gaze swept to Hannah for answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely had Hannah opened her mouth when Brinley jumped in, her voice trembling, &#34;It all happened so fast. I think Hannah pushed me, and suddenly I was falling down the stairs. The next thing I knew, she was tumbling too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning at Hannah, Vincent questioned,&#34;Did you really push her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley gave a weak laugh and chose her words carefully toshift Vincent&#39;s focus. &#34;I can&#39;t say for sure why she did it. Maybe she&#39;s upset about having to assist me with the party planning, but I won&#39;t hold it against her. It&#39;s just a scratch, Vincent. Don&#39;t worry about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter smile crossed Hannah&#39;s lips. &#34;Bravo, Miss Gilbert. That&#39;s some impressive acting.&#34; She looked Vincent dead in the eyes, her voice cutting. &#34;But let&#39;s get this straight. I didn&#39;t lay a finger on her. lf anyone&#39;s lying here, it&#39;s her. She pushed me down the staircase. Just look at her. She&#39;s not hurt at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despair crept in, chilling Hannah to the core. She already knew where Vincent&#39;s trust lay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent showed Brinley&#39;s wounded palm to Hannah.&#34;She&#39;s not exactly fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hannah&#39;s hand was injured too-and Vincent hadn&#39;t even noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bitterness consumed Hannah. No question remained -Vincent didn&#39;t seem to care about her, his&#34;stand-in,&#34; at all. Brinley had his full attention, as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp, humorless laugh escaped Hannah. &#34;You should probably rush her to the emergency room before her minor scratch heals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sarcasm irritated Vincent. He was just trying to get the truth, and his tone might be sharper than intended. &#34;Can&#39;t you just talk normally?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah answered coldly, &#34;Don&#39;t feel like so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension thickened the air, neither willing to yield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sniffles from Brinley filled the silence. &#34;Why do you hate me so much, Hannah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah frowned at the sound. Even with blood running down her own hand, somehow, she&#39;d become the villain, baseless accusations thrown her way. Any urge to put up with it vanished. Her unharmed hand whipped up, landing a slap across Brinley&#39;s cheek with a crack that left no room for confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah spat, &#34;If I wanted to hurt you, Brinley, you&#39;d know it. I don&#39;t waste time with games.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another slap was ready, but Vincent caught her wrist mid-swing. &#34;That&#39;s enough, Hannah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah yanked her arm away and let out a bitter laugh. &#34;So, you couldn&#39;t bear to see her hurt by me,right? And you&#39;re still taking her side, Vincent? I&#39;m your wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s expression tightened as his brow drew together. &#34;Being my wife doesn&#39;t give you the right to bully others like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I&#39;m bullying her?&#34; Hannah scoffed,a bitter laugh about to escape but failed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley quickly stepped in to ease the tension just to make her look good. &#34;Vincent, please don&#39;t be upset.Hannah probably just lost control for a moment. Take me to get my hand treated, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s sharp features softened a bit.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley even glanced over at Hannah, sticking to her considerate persona. &#34;Maybe Hannah needs a hospital trip too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent dismissed the idea immediately. &#34;NNo.Let her cool off for a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the noise soon drew Danica over, her voice sharp with irritation. &#34;What is it this time, Hannah? All this fuss just because you didn&#39;t want to do a little housework?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze shifted, shock freezing her expression as she spotted Brinley&#39;s bleeding hand. &#34;Oh my! Brinley,your hand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle smile, Brinley made a feigned attempt to downplay it. &#34;Really, it&#39;s nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing? That could leave a scar! Vincent, what are you waiting for? Get her to the emergency room-now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;We&#39;re leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley reached out, expecting Vincent to carry her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Vincent simply brushed past her and asked lightly, &#34;Did you hurt your leg?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;N-no, just my hand...&#34; Quick to follow, Brinley trailed after him, shooting a smug, victorious glance at Hannah before disappearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still rooted to the spot, Hannah felt her heart drop lower than ever. Laughter, dry and hollow, escaped her lips. Of course. First loves would always matter more than a stand-in like her. Barely above a whisper,she spoke to the empty hallway. &#34;Vincent, we&#39;re finished.Totally.&#34;</p>
