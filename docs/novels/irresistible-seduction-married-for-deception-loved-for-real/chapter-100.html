                <p>Chapter was closed. Her eyes locked with his, steady and fearless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent stood motionless, the word &#34;force&#34; ringing in his ears like a blow. Instantly, he was dragged back to memories of that day in the bedroom. Apparently,that was how she saw him now. A man who relied on force. For a moment, anger, remorse, and confusion</p>
                
                
                
                <p>warred in his gaze. His throat worked, but no words came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley, quietly triumphant, decided she&#39;d seen enough. There was no point hanging around for another endless fight. She gently patted Vincent on the shoulder. &#34;Vincent, let&#39;s go. It&#39;s obvious Hannah has more important things to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another glance and Vincent caught sight of Hannah and Felix, standing so close together, laughter and gentle exchange passing between them. A storm brewed in his eyes as he shot them a glare sharp enough to cut glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s phone broke the tension-a call from Clive,who hurriedly informed him about a sudden international meeting. Ending the call, Vincent&#39;s eyes returned to Hannah, still dark and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent paused, voice cold and unforgiving, before turning to leave. &#34;If you still care about my grandmother,remember your place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not so much as a blink came from Hannah. &#34;And what place is that, exactly?&#34; she asked, meeting his gaze head-on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed further, her lips twisting with a bitter edge.&#34;What exactly do I need to be mindful of? Who am I to you,really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips twitched. She was just someone he kept in the shadows-never good enough to claim,always expected to act &#34;properly&#34; while he paraded Brinley for everyone to see. Now, he wanted her to stay in line when all she did was hang out with a business partner? How absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No response came from him, nor did she expect one.Disappointment was a feeling she&#39;d long since abandoned. It was the same pattern, always-if Vincent didn&#39;t want to answer, silence would settle in like fog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix, off to the side, watched Hannah with steady,quiet sympathy, his heart twisting at the pain he saw in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single word left Vincent&#39;s lips. In silence, he turned away, Brinley falling in step beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was exactly as Hannah had expected. He always left without a word to the key question. He always had. Nothing about him had ever really changed.But she had-she no longer wasted her breath on questions that would only hang in the air unanswered. Gone were the days of chasing him,who would never turn back for her. Her priorities had shifted. From here on out, she&#39;d start living for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting those thoughts drift away, Hannah picked up the suit and handed it to Felix.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Felix disappeared into the fitting room, emerging every so often until she found a jacket that fit him just right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah presented the chosen suit to the sales assistant. &#34;We&#39;ll take this one. Please have it wrapped up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix pulled out his wallet, ready to pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah gently stopped him, firm but kind. &#34;Don&#39;t even start-today&#39;s expenses are already on you. Let me handle this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just gave a little shrug, a gentle smile lightig up his face. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On their way back to the office, Felix kept sneaking glances her way, clearly deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She caught on and slowed her steps, turning to meet his gaze. &#34;What is it? Do I have something on my face?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He closed the distance, eyes searching hers for answers he couldn&#39;t quite put aside. At last, he gave voice to the question that had haunted him. &#34;May I ask... Why did you ever marry Vincent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix had always wondered. From the outside, it had always seemed like Vincent didn&#39;t even like Hannah.How had she ever said yes to a man who offered so little in return?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet, rueful smile curved Hannah&#39;s lips. &#34;It&#39;s been five years,&#34; she said in a low voice. &#34;I honestly think I&#39;ve forgotten.&#34;</p>
