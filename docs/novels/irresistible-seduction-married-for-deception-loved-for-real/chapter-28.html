                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t Brinley your first love?&#34; Hannah&#39;s words Oozed sarcasm.&#34;Isn&#39;t it just typical for a man to get excited when his first love suddenly reappears?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who put the idea in your head that Brinley was ever my first love?&#34; Vincent replied sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lashes fluttered slightly. Skepticism crept in. If Brinley was not his first, then who could it have been? She shot him a scornful look. &#34;Anyway, don&#39;t count on me to help you.&#34; It was obvious to her that men driven by desire could lie convincingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Already on edge, Vincent snapped, &#34;With the sour look on your face, I could not be less interested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words left his lips, and regret crept in immediately. He tried to take it back, but Hannah was quicker. &#34;Is that so? Then maybe stop pressing your lower half against me,&#34; she retorted, shoving him away as his grip slipped. &#34;Honestly, you disgust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the end of it. The fight ended with both of them angry and nothing solved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent locked himself in the study, his chest heavy and tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two full days went by without a word between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent started leaving the house early and coming home late. Meanwhile, Hannah jumped right back into her role at Nova Tech. In just forty-eight hours,she&#39;d fired the procurement manager, overhauled the organizational structure, and left the staff grumbling behind her back-calling her a flashy figurehead with no real skills, just someone riding on connections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gossip pages soon lit up with bold headlines about Vincent and Brinley-&#34;Jones Group CEO Acts out for His First Love.&#34; The story dominated the entertainment news all afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was how Hannah learned what Vincent had  really been up to after leaving her at the hospital the other day-he had rushed off to play the hero for Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley kept texting Hannah photo after photo of the decorations for Sharon&#39;s upcoming birthday party.Hannah did not bother to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent instructed Clive to wipe the story from every entertainment site. Not long after, Derek messaged Vincent about the suit jacket-it didn&#39;t belong to Felix, and they were still working on figuring out its mysterious owner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent grunted in response and ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, almost everyone was home-Brinley was the only one missing. Sharon&#39;s eyes sparkled as she saw the family together and called everyone over for breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fair amount of time had passed since Hannah last saw Sharon.She purred, &#34;Sharon, I missed you.&#34; She leaned in and rested her head on Sharon&#39;s shoulder,showing real affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon reached up and gave Hannah&#39;s nose a playfu pinch. &#34;You sweet thing. I missed you just as much.&#34;She smoothed Hannah&#39;s hair and grinned. &#34;Now,about the baby, how is that coming along? Will I get to hear some good news on my birthday? Nothing would make me happier than the arrival of a great-grandchild.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While speaking, Sharon turned her gaze toward Vincent,making her expectations perfectly clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent hesitated for a moment and then replied honestly, &#34;When things slow down at work, I&#39;ll take Hannah away on a vacation.&#34; The meaning behind his words was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah managed a polite, well-practiced smile. A baby? She would leave Vincent&#39;s world entirely in eighteen days. Lowering her eyes, she quietly took a spoonful of porridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica, unable to keep quiet, looked Hannah up and down. &#34;If you want my opinion, the issue probably</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lies with Hannah. Five years and not a single child?That&#39;s definitely strange.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s face tightened with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica shrugged, tossing up her hands. &#34;Don&#39;t look at me like that. Somebody had to say it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s grip on her spoon tightened. All those old hurts rushed back instantly. She faced Danica and spoke with steady clarity.r maybe your son&#39;s the problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, Hannah had done everything she could to win Danica&#39;s approval, all for Vincent&#39;s sake. Yet no matter her efforts, it had never been good enough. Danica never accepted her. But now, none of that mattered anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A muscle jumped in Vincent&#39;s jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica stared at Hannah, caught off guard.&#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went for a full checkup. The doctor said | was perfectly healthy. So, the childless issue is not on mell Hannah said, her tone cool. She cast a glance at Vincent. &#34;Lately, I&#39;ve noticed he&#39;s a little off. Not quite the stamina he used to have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two nights had passed since they last shared a bed.Now, Hannah was throwing it in his face in front of everyone. Vincent could tell she was doing it on purpose.</p>
