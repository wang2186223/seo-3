                <p>For Danica, losing ten properties was a blow she couldn&#39;t forget. A storm of frustration churned within her,and every time Hannah&#39;s name popped into her mind, her hands started to shake. No one would have been surprised by how much she wanted to lash out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus, Danica had targeted the second-floor bedroom, the very room Hannah had poured her heart into decorating. Everyone in the family knew Hannah&#39;s one request: the arrangement in that room was to remain untouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica had been set on getting back at Hannah, no matter how petty it seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each tear or frown from Hannah only fueled Danica&#39;s sense of victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Brinley, who had quietly listened to Danica&#39;s words, began to feel a bit lighter. The sadness that clung to her after Vincent&#39;s hasty exit finally faded. &#34;Mrs. Jones, I&#39;m grateful for your support,&#34; she whispered, her voice soft as silk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you don&#39;t need to thank me for anything,&#34; Danica replied, a warm smile spreading across her face.&#34;I went ahead and redid that bedroom to your taste. You&#39;ll absolutely adore it. It&#39;s just right for you and Vincent once you&#39;re married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shy smile played on Brinley&#39;s lips, but shadows passed through her eyes as she remembered every incident-from the gala&#39;s chaos to the tense moments at the Jones family estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sleep had barely touched Vincent last night. Dawn found him wandering downstairs, only to discover Sharon and Danica already gathered around the breakfast table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Puling out a chair, Vincent sat down and sent a glance toward Aubrey.&#34;Where&#39;s Hannah?&#34; he asked, almost as an afterthought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey answered promptly, &#34;She left before sunrise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Danica chimed in, &#34;I have no clue what keeps Hannah so busy lately. It&#39;s like she&#39;s never home anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon shot her a look. &#34;If Hannah is out, then she clearly has her reasons. Instead of gossiping, why don&#39;t you find something useful to do around here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica muttered to herself, &#34;She&#39;s a housewife, not a businesswoman. What could she possibly be so busy with? She&#39;s probably out seeing other men.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Vincent and Sharon picked up every word, despite Danica&#39;s low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon slammed her spoon onto the table with a loud clatter. &#34;If you keep spouting nonsense at breakfast,you can eat somewhere else. From now on, we&#39;ll eat in separate roomns.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Vincent showed nothing. He nursed his coffee, adjusted his jacket, and then strode out without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Derek waited near the curb, checking his watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a second passed after Vincent slid into the back seat before Derek took note of his haggard appearance. &#34;You didn&#39;t get a wink of sleep, did you,Mr.Jones?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint crease formed between Vincent&#39;s brows, and he gave a low grunt in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Jones, no matter how packed your schedule is, you can&#39;t neglect your health. Your grandmother&#39;s holding onto hope that you&#39;ll start a family soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent shot Derek a look, calm but chilling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, Derek decided it was better not to say another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive went on in silence until Vincent broke it, gaze still fixed on the passing scenery. &#34;I&#39;ll send you a layout sketch later. Purchase the materials exactly as specified-color, dimensions, style. Everything has to match. I want my bedroom on the second floor redone to those exact specifications.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; Derek replied, his tone brisk and unquestioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arriving at the office, Vincent was immediately met by Clive&#39;s eager announcement. &#34;Mr. Jones, Miss Gilbert&#39;s been waiting in your office for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trailing after Vincent, Clive added, &#34;Oh, and here is the custom ring you ordered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent took the dainty band, holding it up against his own ring finger. &#34;This is too loose by a millimeter.I specified sixteen, not seventeen. Redo it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flickered in Clive&#39;s eyes. At that time, he had let his excitement get ahead of him and asked Brinley for the size instead, assuming it would be close enough. Never had he thought Vincent would catch such a tiny difference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent didn&#39;t give him another glance. When he entered his office, Brinley stepped forward to greet him.He cut straight to the point.&#34;Why are you here?&#34;</p>
