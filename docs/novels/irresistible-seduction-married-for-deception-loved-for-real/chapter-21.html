                <p>&#34;You want coffee? No need for you to get it yourself -I can go. Still want your usual iced Americano?&#34;Derek asked, always tuned in to Vincent&#39;s preferences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No coffee today,&#34; Vincent muttered, eyes fixed on the view outside. His mood was anything but calm.&#34;Just drive to Chance Café.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About five minutes later, they pulled up to Chance Café. Vincent wasted no time striding inside. Inside,Hannah had her hair tied up, showing off the smooth lines of her face. Her features were soft, her energy unmistakable. Her eyes had a doe-like brightness,and she nibbled on her lip when she thought. The man seated next to her gazed at her with a soft expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s jaw clenched. As a man, he knew exactly what that look meant-that guy harbored feelings toward Hannah. And to make matters worse, it was the same man who had taken Hannah home the other night. Twice now. She had been with that guy twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the table, Hannah and Felix were locked in animated discussion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah had just uncovered a key issue-Nova Tech&#39;s procurement manager had been pocketing kickbacks for years, which explained why their materials had been so substandard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The procurement manager needs to be removed,&#34;Hannah said without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix hesitated. &#34;He&#39;s been part of the company for a long time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;ll get a proper severance,&#34; she said firmly. &#34;Or he can be reassigned to a non-critical role.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix leaned forward slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>thinking of returning to the company?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In a day or two,&#34; she responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently slid a plate of pastries in her direction. &#34;Eat something first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not that hungry,&#34; Hannah said, resting her chin on one hand while scanning the computer screen.&#34;Once we streamline the team,we can finally focus on developing new products.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix nodded in agreement. &#34;Exactly. With a clear brand identity, we&#39;ll have no trouble connecting with the female market.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling encouraged, Hannah reached out and grabbed a pastry. A small dollop of whipped cream ended up on the tip of her nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix thought the sight was irresistibly cute. He picked up a napkin and paused, debating whether to hand it to her or wipe it himself. After a moment, he chose the bolder option and reached out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could touch her, a tall figure appeared,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>blocking his hand midair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s eyes widened when she looked up and saw Vincent standing there. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent replied curtly, &#34;Stopped by to grab coffee.Saw you by coincidence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah, right. Hannah knew better-since when had Vincent ever fetched his own coffee?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent pulled out a chair and sat between the two of them. He turned to Hannah. &#34;Second time I&#39;ve met this gentleman, and still no introduction?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Felix Wade,&#34; Hannah said flatly. &#34;Vincent Jones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two men gave each other a nod, both keeping their expressions carefully neutral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what line of work are you in, Mr. Wade?&#34; Vincent asked with a laid-back tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I run a small business,&#34; Felix replied, his voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent leaned in slightly. &#34;How small are we talking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix brought his cup to his lips. &#34;Around twenty employees.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight arch of Vincent&#39;s brow followed. &#34;That&#39;s definitely on the small side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah shot Vincent a look. &#34;Are you doing a background check? What&#39;s with all the questions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just chatting. But if it bothers you, I&#39;ll stop,&#34; Vincent replied smoothly, flashing a calm smile at her.what were you two talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix answered before she could, &#34;Nothing serious.Just some work stuff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Work? Since when does my wife need to work?&#34;Vincent smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent kept his tone light, but each word struck Hannah like a slap-sharp and dismissive. So, that was what he really thought of her. After five years of marriage and everything she had given up just to be a housewife behind closed doors for him, this was all she got from him-mockery dressed as casual conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of anger crossed Felix&#39;s face. &#34;Sounds like being married to you isn&#39;t exactly the dream people assume it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s brow tightened at the remark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without raising his voice, Felix added, &#34;Hannah, you made the wise choice of divorcing him.&#34;</p>
