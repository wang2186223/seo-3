                <p>&#34;Why not? We&#39;re getting divorced anyway,&#34; Hannah remarked coldly as she crossed her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent had lost track of how many times she&#39;d brought up ending things. An ache settled somewhere deep as he asked, &#34;So you&#39;re dead set on divorcing me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No hesitation met his question. &#34;Absolutely,&#34; Hannah answered, cold and unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes locked. Hannah was the first to look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coldness slipped into Vincent&#39;s tone. &#34;Are you sure you can actually handle life without me?&#34; It was barely a question. He remembered clearly how, from the day they met, she&#39;d always found a reason to be near him. He doubted she would actually walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need you, Vincent. No one&#39;s irreplaceable,Hannah said,her voice steady as she raised her chin.&#34;I&#39;ll be better off without you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That declaration left him stunned and silent. Did she truly believe she&#39;d be happier on her own? A hard glint came into his gaze. &#34;Don&#39;t you ever take those birth control pills behind my back again. And as for this divorce idea-drop it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finality echoed in his voice, dismissing her request for a divorce entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s frown deepened, her gaze holding steady.With measured determination, she said, &#34;I mean it,Vincent. I really want a divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance crept into his expression. &#34;Unless you want me to tell my grandma about you taking those pills, I suggest you shut your mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah raised an eyebrow. &#34;You won&#39;t tell her.&#34; Both of them cared about Sharon&#39;s condition too much to say anything to sour her mood and potentially cause her to faint from emotional distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leveling her tone, Hannah added, &#34;Seriously, think about getting a divorce. I&#39;ve made up my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Hannah&#39;s unwavering resolve made Vincent&#39;s temper spike. Ignoring her last remark, he spun around, yanked open the door, and leaned out over the railing. &#34;Brinley!&#34; he called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, Brinley and Danica exchanged a quick,puzzled look. Neither had any idea what had just happened. Without wasting a moment, the two of them made their way up the stairs at a brisk pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cautious step, Brinley stopped at the landing.&#34;Is everything okay, Vincent? Did something happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent shot her a glance. &#34;Didn&#39;t you want to go skiing? Get your things-we&#39;re leaving now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delight flashed in Danica&#39;s eyes. She tugged on Brinley&#39;s sleeve, unable to contain herself. &#34;He&#39;s taking you, finally! What are you waiting for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley tamped down her joy and said gently, still playing the thoughtful charade, &#34;Vincent, perhaps I should pass. Your grandmother was right. I&#39;d only be intruding on your time with Hannah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only you and I are going,&#34; Vincent said flatly, his gaze never wavering from Hannah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Brinley and Danica turned, eyes landing on Hannah for her reaction. Had Hannah and Vincent just gotten into an argument?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely reacting, Hannah quietly unpacked her bag,removing her belongings one by one. A calm farewell slipped from her lips. &#34;Hope you both have a great time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she planted her hand on Vincent&#39;s shoulder and pushed him out the door. A loud bang followed as she slammed it shut behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance simmered in Danica&#39;s expression. Who did Hannah think she was, treating Vincent so coldly?Hannah&#39;s behavior had grown more and more outrageous lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every instinct told Danica to speak up, but she swallowed her irritation, remembering Vincent&#39;s decision to take Brinley for the skiing trip. The last thing she wanted was to see him take Hannah&#39;s side again, So, she forced a sweet smile and faced Vincent and Brinley. &#34;Go on and enjoy yourselves.Have a wonderful time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delight shone in Brinley&#39;s eyes. &#34;Thank you, Mrs.Jones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With purposeful strides, Vincent set the pace, forcing Brinley to hurry just to keep up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Already prepared, the private jet waited on the tarmac. Derek appeared and greeted Vincent with polished professionalism, his eyes lingering for just a second on Brinley walking close behind Vincent. A hint of surprise flickered across his face. Word on the grapevine might actually be true-was Vincent really going to marry Brinley?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek masked his curiosity, keeping his expression even as he escorted them aboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Free time stretched before Hannah, leaving her momentarily aimless. Work obligations were on hold for the day, and the last details of the birthday party preparation were now in the hands of event staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her eyes landed on the shopping bag she brought back yesterday, an idea came to her.Delivering it to Miles at Sterling Heights sounded like a good way to spend her afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scribbled a quick note, slipped it into the bag,and grabbed the bag on her way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Descending the stairs, she noted Danica leisurely sipping her coffee and wearing an air of contentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica looked pleased with herself. The instant her eyes landed on Hannah, she figured Hannah was full of regret for her earlier behavior and had come to chase after Vincent. With a smug smile, she said,&#34;You&#39;re too late to chase them now. Brinley and Vincent left some time ago. There&#39;s no way you&#39;ll catch up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A split-second pause was all it took for Hannah to catch Danica&#39;s meaning. No argument left her lips.Instead, she played along with a sly grin. &#34;Maybe you&#39;re right. Maybe I should just fly directly to the ski resort and wait for Vincent there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suggestion sent Danica into a panic. &#34;Hannah,don&#39;t do anything reckless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter bubbled from Hannah, but she offered no further reply, heading straight out to her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had Hannah&#39;s car disappeared than Danica fired off a frantic message to Brinley.&#34;Hannah&#39;s had a change of heart-she&#39;s coming for Vincent!&#34;</p>
