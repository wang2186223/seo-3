                <p>Mockery laced every word as Rena replied,,SO the famous CEO of the Jones Group suddenly can&#39;t understand simple words? Now you&#39;re worried about Hannah? Too late. Why don&#39;t you just return and look after your darling childhood love?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After delivering that jab, Rena headed toward Hannah&#39;s hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent trailed right behind her despite her attempt to shake him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Rena entered Hannah&#39;s ward, Vincent stepped forward from behind Rena and approached Hannah&#39;s bedside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shrug accompanied Rena&#39;s words. &#34;Sorry, Hannah.Couldn&#39;t lose him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A blank look settled on Hannah&#39;s face while she said indifferently, &#34;Mr. Jones, what do you want from me now? Demanding me to pay your mistress&#39;s hospital expenses?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t we have a normal conversation?&#34; Vincent&#39;s gaze shifted to Hannah&#39;s right hand, now wrapped in white gauze. He distinctly remembered it had been fine earlier. &#34;What did the doctor say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reply was flat and cold. &#34;That doesn&#39;t concern you.&#34; Every bit of pain came rushing back as she thought about how the glass shard-almost as big as her thumb-had been pulled from her hand. Enduring that made her believe she could face anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent took a step forward and sat beside her bed.&#34;What really happened back there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter anymore,&#34; Hannah said, her voice devoid of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent added, &#34;I just wanted to know the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, Hannah closed her eyes,shutting him down completely. Aside from the glance she had cast his way the moment he entered, she hadn&#39;t spared him a look since. She was truly mad at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a nurse stepped inside. &#34;Ma&#39;am,how is your head? Does the concussion still trouble you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah shook her head and answered, &#34;I&#39;m much better.Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse replaced her IV bag with practiced hands.&#34;You&#39;ll need these fluids through the night. It&#39;s best if someone stays here with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent gave a courteous reply. &#34;I understand. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena waved him off. &#34;Go keep your precious Brinley company. I&#39;ll stay here and look after Hannah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a steady voice, Vincent replied, &#34;I&#39;ll stay. There&#39;s no need for you to trouble yourself, Miss Brown.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;Really? I was the one who&#39;d picked Hannah up and rushed her to the hospital.Where were you while she needed you the most?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent had no answer for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena looked like she wanted to continue, but Vincent pressed his finger to his lips and softly said, &#34;She&#39;s asleep now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Rena&#39;s phone rang, and she excused herself. Vincent nodded, walking her to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Brinley had been looking everywhere for Vincent after her hand was bandaged. She&#39;d already asked Derek and learned Vincent had not gone home. He was still somewhere in the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All at once, Brinley caught sight of Vincent leaving a ward with a woman right behind. As soon as that woman walked away, Vincent turned around and reentered the ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley made her way over, only to discover Hannah lying in the hospital bed. A mix of anger and disbelief twisted her features. That annoying Hannah really was everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Burning with irritation, Brinley headed back to the ER and complained about feeling dizzy. A nurse guided her to a ward to rest. She even requested an IV, so the nurse hooked her up to a glucose drip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent never left Hannah&#39;s side the entire night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time morning arrived and Hannah finally woke up, her eyes immediately landed on him. He was sitting by her bed, head leaned back and eyes shut as if he had fallen asleep. Even while slumped in the chair, he still managed to look dignified and in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he sensed her gaze, he opened his eyes and spoke in a low voice. &#34;Staring at me first thing after waking up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him and asked, &#34;You weren&#39;t really sleeping?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He replied, &#34;No. I just had my eyes closed for a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way he said it left her unsure-had he been awake the whole night, or had he only managed to close his eyes just now? But she didn&#39;t care enough to find out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, her phone vibrated with a new message from Brinley. &#34;Believe it or not-just one text from me and Vincent will come running to me.&#34;</p>
