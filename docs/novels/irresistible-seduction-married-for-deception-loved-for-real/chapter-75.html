                <p>Brinley held up her phone for everyone to see, the screen displaying a series of chat screenshots. &#34;I might have kept my name out of the spotlight all these years, but I&#39;ve always stayed in touch with the women on the website. Every year, I reach out,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The device made its way from hand to hand among the crowd, drawing curious looks. Comments rippled through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These screenshots look real to me. The dates are all there-she&#39;s been keeping in contact for years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That seal must be ancient history. Maybe Miss Gilbert just forgot it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could be. And come on, with Mr. Jones personally backing her-how could she not be the real deal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thinking back, Victoria&#39;s rise was so sudden... Makes you wonder if the Jones Group had her back from the start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, that&#39;s probably it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd gradually accepted Brinley&#39;s claim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley shot Hannah a smug glance, her expression triumphant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting that look with only a faint smile, Hannah replied, &#34;Your evidence is certainly convincing.I suppose there&#39;s no question now-you really are Victoria. That means you&#39;ve also got the custom seal. Am I right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley, pleased by Hannah&#39;s apparent concession,lifted her chin. &#34;Of course, I do. Something that valuable has always been in my care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Miles furrowed his brow and gave Brinley a sidelong glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s lips curved into a subtle, icy smile. Did Brinley really think she could pass herself off as Victoria without even doing her homework? Her tone turned cool and sharp. &#34;That&#39;s interesting because the real Victoria never owned a seal with her name on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of shock rooted Brinley to the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, Hannah angled her head, her tone even and steady. &#34;If you were truly Victoria, wouldn&#39;t you know this? Years ago, so-called &#39;official Victoria seals&#39; started popping up for sale. People scrambled to get their hands on them. But Victoria wasted no time and immediately made it clear-she never approved any of it.She issued a public denial for all to see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reason guided Hannah&#39;s words. Her voice was measured and quiet, but the weight behind it was unmistakable. Murmurs rippled through the crowd as uncertainty began to take hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s fists tightened at her sides. Her jaw clenched as she hadn&#39;t expected Hannah to turn the tables by setting her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent, who&#39;d been watching Hannah, slowly redirected his focus to Brinley. His features gave nothing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching his eye, Brinley straightened her posture and moved to face him. Relief crept in when his gaze revealed no clear sign of disappointment or disdain. She explained in a rush, &#34;I meant well then. Those imitation seals were ridiculously expensive. Buyers snapped them up because of me. I just didn&#39;t think it was right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wanting to sound sincere, she added, &#34;Honesty, I was just looking out for everyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corners of Hannah&#39;s mouth curled as she started to clap her hands slowly. She didn&#39;t break eye contact with Brinley. &#34;How thoughtful of you. Since you remember that, I&#39;m sure you can also recall exactly what Victoria said in her official statement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking away, Brinley&#39;s confidence faltered. &#34;It was just something like telling people not to buy, wasn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh?&#34; Hannah stepped forward, narrowing the gap between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley retreated almost automatically. &#34;I... I&#39;m not certain of the exact words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not sure, huh?&#34; Hannah&#39;s gaze sharpened, her words icy and pointed.&#34;Or maybe you just never were Victoria at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No answer came from Brinley. Her lips moved, but nothing escaped. The crowd&#39;s whispers picked up,feeding her anxiety and making the room feel smaller.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic nearly overwhelmed Brinley as she found herself pinned against the bar-until Vincent intervened,reaching out to move her safely aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s voice sliced through the tension. &#34;That&#39;s enough, Hannah,&#34; he said, his tone icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah stopped in her tracks as she caught the unmistakable protectiveness in Vincent&#39;s stance. With a slight tug at her lips, she let a cool smile surface. &#34;Mr. Jones, I&#39;m only pressing Miss Gilbert for a little clarification, just to keep things transparent for everyone here. Yet, you&#39;re so quick to defend her-don&#39;t you think you&#39;re overdoing it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow flickered across Vincent&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Hannah held his gaze, refusing to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley bit her lip, feeling the weight of all the eyes fixed on her. Her heart raced wildly. Suddenly,she pressed her hand to her chest, squeezed her eyes shut, and collapsed straight into Vincent&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of shock spread through the onlookers. &#34;What just happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s expression darkened. He sent Hannah a blistering look, scooped Brinley up, and strode out of the room without so much as a word to anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room quickly descended into chaos, with guests demanding an explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat gathered on the event organizer&#39;s brow as he tried to reassure the crowd, &#34;Miss Gilbert is Victoria, I assure you!&#34; But as more doubts were raised, his confidence visibly faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk threatened at the edges of Hannah&#39;s expression as she watched Vincent disappear with Brinley.The entire display struck her as nothing short of absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pivoting away, Hannah caught sight of Miles already making for the door. Wasting no time, she moved to catch up. &#34;Mr.Whitaker,wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miles turned, his expression barely concealing his impatience the moment he saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah offered her business card. &#34;I overheard you earlier-your interest in female safety products. My team is currently-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not interested in working with someone like you,&#34; Miles cut her off flatly.</p>
