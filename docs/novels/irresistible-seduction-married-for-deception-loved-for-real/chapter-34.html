            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Vincent pushed his sleeves up to his elbows. He warmed his hands by rubbing them together, and then gently began to work the bruise on Hannah&#39;s waist. His touch was light and careful, never once causing her any pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thick silence filled the space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Vincent spoke in a low voice. &#34;Brinley isn&#39;t a bad person. She didn&#39;t mean any of this. Don&#39;t hold it against her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp, bitter laugh escaped Hannah. So this was why he applied the ointment for her, not out of care, but to keep her from calling the police and to prevent things from getting out of hand. So much for concern.It was all for another woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah pushed herself upright, tilting her chin as she stared at him with a cold smirk. &#34;Vincent, did you miss what just happened, or do you just not want to see it? She started all of this, and now you want me to just let it go? I&#39;m not that forgiving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment shone in her eyes as she brushed his hand away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent stayed where he was, pressing his fingers to the bridge of his nose, frustration plain on his face.&#34;You weren&#39;t like this before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words made Hannah freeze. Not like this before? A chill swept through her, leaving her numb. He&#39;d reminded her of how she used to bend over backward for his family. Now that she no longer cared to hide her sharp edges, he missed the tolerant and gentle version of her. But that girl? Vincent had killed her with his own hands. No. Precisely speaking, he didn&#39;t miss her past self. He missed the docile, self-sacrificinggirl who reminded him of Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes went frosty. She kicked him away.&#34;Just leave. Go be with your precious Brinley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not finished with the ointment,&#34; Vincent replied, voice tight and strained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need your help with the ointment. The pain doesn&#39;t bother me.&#34; She turned her head away, the sting from the ointment and the throb in her waist paled in comparison to the ache in her chest. Her heart felt like it was bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s jaw tightened. Brinley had become a sore spot between them-mention her once, and Hannah&#39;s claws came out. Every time, they ended up fighting. How had everything fallen apart so completely? They could not go even a minute without falling into an argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another heavy silence settled over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Hannah stood up, her eyes fixed on the floor. &#34;Vincent, we really can&#39;t go on like this.&#34; She drew in a steady breath. &#34;Let&#39;s get a divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkness clouded Vincent&#39;s face. &#34;That&#39;s not happening. Just drop that idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wry smile touched her lips. &#34;Vincent, don&#39;t be stubborn. What&#39;s the point of dragging this out?&#34; He was the one who&#39;d treated her as Brinley&#39;s stand-in-and yet he was also the one who refused to let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want a divorce that badly?&#34; His gaze pinned her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sick.&#34; Hannah lifted her eyes, her stare distant, as if he were nothing but a stranger now. &#34;Five years is long enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had spent five years as husband and wife. For five years, she&#39;d given him everything she had while he&#39;d treated her like a substitute for Brinley. She didn&#39;t want to go on like this anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence grew even heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent stared at her, emotion flickering in his eyes-fury, disbelief, and something darker. Her eyes burned with quiet resolve, adding to his inner turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not happening,&#34; he said at last, his tone leaving no room for argument.&#34;Get that idea out of your head.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him a small, empty smile. &#34;Vincent, aren&#39;t you tired by all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five years of looking at her, seeing only Brinley&#39;s shadow-wasn&#39;t he sick of it? She had been a stand-in for five years without realizing it until recently. Even if he was fine with it, she was finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swallowed her bitterness and added, &#34;If we divorce, you can give Brinley a proper title. That&#39;s better than whatever this mess is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s mouth set in a hard line. His expression was thunderous. &#34;I&#39;ve already told you, whatever you think about Brinley and me,you&#39;re wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm of tension thickened the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a knock broke through the heaviness. &#34;Mr. Jones, your meeting is about to start,&#34; Derek remarked from the other side of the door.</p>
