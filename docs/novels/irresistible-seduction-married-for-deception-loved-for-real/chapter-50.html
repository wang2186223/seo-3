                <p>&#34;Go home.&#34; Vincent&#39;s tone was as cold as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek grumbled silently to himself. Vincent practically lived at the hospital these days, and people might start thinking he&#39;d moved in for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Vincent&#39;s phone buzzed. Brinley&#39;s name flashed on the screen. He picked up without delay.&#34;Vincent...&#34; Her voice shook, barely holding it together. &#34;Everyone online is tearing me apart. I can&#39;t handle this. I&#39;m not the villain they make me out to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent could hear her quick, shallow breaths through the line. His voice grew gentler. &#34;Try to stay calm.I&#39;ll handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tiny, broken plea slipped out. &#34;Will you still visit me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow.&#34; He offered a few more comforting words before ending the call. He then pressed his fingers to the bridge of his nose, trying to focus. &#34;Derek, leak some juicy celebrity news to the press. Distract them from Brinley. And start filing lawsuits against anyone posting defamatory comments.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to read Vincent&#39;s expression, Derek quietly responded, &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent cracked the window, letting the wind in. The breeze cleared his head, if only a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the Jones estate, Hannah finished up her work around ten and slipped away to the bathroom for a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping out of the bathroom wrapped in just a towel, Hannah froze, her heart skipped a beat.Vincent stood there, leaning against the doorframe,as silent as a shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you finally decided to leave the hospital?&#34; she said, her voice laced with sarcasm. She hadn&#39;t seenI him at home for three days, but she&#39;d seen his face plastered all over Brinley&#39;s social media every single day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I camne straight from work,&#34; Vincent replied, his tone as chilly as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah just shrugged, her words flat. &#34;Oh.&#34; She couldn&#39;t care less where he returned from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s gaze sharpened. &#34;What&#39;s with those comments online?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah blinked. So, he&#39;d shown up just to confront her over the screenshot she&#39;d shared of Brinley&#39;s private message. Naturally, he showed up to defend Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;You&#39;ve seen it. Was there any point coming all this way just to ask?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, she&#39;d posted that screenshot deliberately.Making Brinley feel utterly humiliated was exactly what she wanted. So what if it was petty?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s hand shot out, catching her at the waist,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>his expression impossible to read. &#34;You were serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to break herself free, knee flying up in a sharp warning, but he dodged and trapped her,pressing his leg between hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn right I was.&#34; Hannah shot back, refusing to back down. It seemed Brinley had him completely wrapped around her finger. All it took was one post,and he was storming back, ready to pick a fight on her behalf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The longer Hannah stared at Vincent, the more she felt sick to her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young, energetic, won&#39;t let you down in any department?&#39; Is that really your type? You&#39;d really dump me for someone like that?&#34; Vincent&#39;s jaw clenched as his mind flashed back to the top comment he&#39;d seen online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; Hannah blinked in confusion.Then it hit her-he must&#39;ve seen the top comment she&#39;d liked on that post. So he wasn&#39;t here to defend Brinley afer all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s mind whirled, her irritation momentarily replaced by confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she was still piecing things together, Vincent suddenly leaned down and bit her on the collarbone,almost as if to punish her. &#34;You&#39;re trying to drive me insane,&#34; he said, voice low and rough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ow!&#34; Hannah hissed, pressing her hands against his chest to create some distance. &#34;Are you insane?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fought to break free, twisting in his embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Vincent wasn&#39;t about to let her go. With one swift motion, he pinned her wrists above her head,the cool metal of his cufflinks pressing into her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She jerked back instinctively, trying to put space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Vincent wasn&#39;t finished. Hle grabbed her by the waist and lifted her, setting her down on the vanity. &#34;Vincent, what do you think you&#39;re-&#34; Her protest was cut short as he crashed his mouth onto hers, the kiss hard and possessive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bit down on her lower lip until shetasted blood,the sharp tang spreading between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was enough. Hannah shoved him off with all her strength, wiping her lips and shooting him a look of disgust. &#34;If you want sex, go crawl back to Brinley.Get the hell away from me!&#34;</p>
