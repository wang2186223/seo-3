                <p>Guilt twisted in Vincent&#39;s chest, quick and sharp. An idea surfaced almost instantly. He thumbed out a message to Derek. &#34;Book two ski passes for tomorrow. And line up a sports car-a nice one,something a woman would love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent had noted that Hannah had been driving that car for almost five years. It was crying out for an upgrade. A memory surfaced of his skipping dinner with her parents for Brinley-and he knew he still owed her for that. He didn&#39;t think much of it. He would just make it up to her all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across town, Derek was sprawled in bed, half-focused on a mobile game, when Vincent&#39;s message popped up. He sat bolt upright. He typed back immediately. &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling out of bed, Derek got to work, shaking his head with a crooked smile. Who was Vincent trying to impress this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, he told Clive to push back every meeting set for the next day, freeing Vincent&#39;s calendar. Clive responded just as quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Vincent found his gaze lingering over the suit jacket, appreciation deepening as he traced the fine stitching. Hannah truly had an eye for style.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still lost in admiration when the bathroom door swung open without warning. He quickly set the jacket back in its place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah emerged, wrapped in nothing but a towel.At the sight of Vincent standing in her room, her expression tightened. &#34;Why are you in here?&#34; She tugged on a loose T-shirt, deliberately turning her back as she pulled it over her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent closed the distance between them, his voice soft. &#34;Do you have anything planned for tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out, attempting to tuck a damp strand of hair behind her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She immediately batted his hand away. &#34;If you have nothing better to do, get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand dropped to his side, awkward and uncertain. She was still angry-understandably so.After all, she&#39;d made the effort to pick out a gift for him, only for him to jump to conclusions and accuse her of things she hadn&#39;t done. Anyone in her position would be furious. Especially since she&#39;d cared about him more than anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to ease the tension, Vincent said, his voice gentler now, &#34;I had Derek get us two ski tickets for tomorrow. You&#39;re available tomorrow, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah eyed him warily and stepped back, suspicion etched across her features. &#34;Skiing? Why the sudden urge?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments ago, they&#39;d been locked in a heated argument. Now, with a flick of his tone, he was tossing out a ski trip invitation as if nothing had happened. She genuinely couldn&#39;t make sense of what was running through his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent offered a half-hearted explanation. &#34;You&#39;ve been run ragged organizing, my grandma&#39;s birthday.Figured you might want a break. Somewhere overseas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he kept to himself was that their constant bickering had worn them both thin, and after she&#39;d gone out of her way to buy him a suit as a gift, maybe this trip could be their way back to each other. But Hannah&#39;s expression stayed stubbornly cool, not even a flicker of emotion breaking through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got things to do,&#34; Hannah replied, her tone flat as glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s expression shifted. &#34;You don&#39;t want to go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Yeah. Skiing&#39;s boring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His features hardened, a chill settling over him.They&#39;d never even had a proper wedding-just a rushed honeymoon, holed up in a villa under Evrellia&#39;s towering, snow-draped mountains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still remembered that back then, they&#39;d spent endless days watching flurries drift past the windows. Whenever the storm clouds finally cleared,she would slip her hand into his and coax him outside, her eyes bright with anticipation, eager for them to carve fresh trails across the untouched slopes. She&#39;d once swore skiing was her greatest joy.But now she dismissed it, as if those memories meant nothing at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath snagged, but he forced his tone to remain steady. &#34;The tickets are booked. Non-refundable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brittle laugh slipped from Hannah&#39;s lips. &#34;Since when do you care about a couple of nonrefundable tickets?&#34; Her gaze cut through him, glacial and unyielding.&#34;Why not take Brinley with you? She&#39;d jump at the chance to hit the slopes with you. I&#39;m not here to play games.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s jaw tensed, half his face swallowed by shadow. &#34;I&#39;m not negotiating with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah lifted a brow, her cold smile icy and detached. &#34;And I&#39;ve already said no.&#34; Her voice dripped with contempt. &#34;Are you going to force me again?&#34;</p>
