                <p>Vincent&#39;s tone dipped so low that it sent an icy tremor racing along Hannah&#39;s spine. So he had been aware of how people badmouthed and slandered her the whole time, accusing her of being a kept woman while she was his rightful wife, their marriage under wraps due to his demands. He&#39;d known what she had been through but chosen to do nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until now, she had been convincing herself he was oblivious to the helI she&#39;d faced, and that if he had heard, he would&#39;ve stood up for her. How pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah wrenched her hand free from Vincent&#39;s grasp, her stare frigid as it locked onto his. &#34;When they accused me of clinging to you like some pathetic leech, calling you my benefactor, you stood by and said nothing, still keeping our marriage under your hat. But the moment Felix and I were seen in the same store and rumors flared up, your ego was bruised, and their opinions suddenly mattered?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You&#39;re unbelievable, Vincent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s mouth tensed. &#34;We&#39;re talking about Felix.Leave everything else out of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah scoffed. It always came down to whatever he decided was worth mentioning. She spun around to ascend the stairs, her voice drained of emotion.&#34;Then we&#39;ve got nothing to address.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved again, palms planted firmly on the polished handrail, cutting off her path. &#34;You won&#39;t talk? Fine.&#34; He seized her wrist and pinned it to the wall, his thumb pressing against the links of the bracelet.&#34;Then remove this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah tried to jerk her hand away, her voice laced with fire. &#34;Who gave you the authority to decide what I keep?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she struggled, the chain dug sharply into her skin,leaving a scrape behind. &#34;You&#39;re hurting me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Vincent tore the clasp and hurled the bracelet to the floor. &#34;There. Not anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s breath caught. She bolted down the stairs and snatched the bracelet up like it was something saored-but it was already broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s brow furrowed at how flustered she looked.She was this emotional-over a gift from someone else?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you lost your mind?&#34; she hissed, her glare freezing. The rage had peaked. She&#39;d barely worn the bracelet for a full day-just enough to start getting used to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just a bracelet,&#34; he shot back, his voice frigid.&#34;Have I ever failed to afford you any jewelry?&#34; His voice was taut with rage. &#34;You&#39;re seriously throwing a fit over something that didn&#39;t even cost ten grand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah said nothing, her icy gaze fixed on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent let out a sigh. &#34;Fine. Derek will deliver a whole collection tomorrow. Choose whatever to your liking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was indifferent, even condescending-like</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the bracelet he broke was worthless. Like what she felt meant nothing. It made her blood simmer. To him,everything had a price tag. Even she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah tightened her fingers around the broken bracelet, her voice hollow. &#34;Save it. I&#39;m not accepting anything from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent gave a dry chuckle. &#34;Is that so? Funny. You used to flaunt every item I got you like they were royal heirlooms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She barely reacted-because it wasn&#39;t a lie. Back when she loved him, every gift had meant everything.But after he broke her heart, she&#39;d sold them all.Every last piece. Including the purple gemstone necklace identical to the one Brinley wore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah gave a faint smile. &#34;Then your observation is lacking. I haven&#39;t worn anything from you for ages.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent faltered, his gaze instinctively dropping to scan her outfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah ignored him and grabbed her belongings,continuing up the steps. &#34;If you&#39;re hellbent on compensating me for the broken bracelet, get the exact same one. Anything else, I couldn&#39;t care less about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brushed past and headed straight to the guest room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s throat bobbed, his reply stuck as he watched her walk away. His chest rose and fell sharply, his breath uneven. She cared that much about a bracelet Felix gave her-enough to demand an identical replacement?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold snort left his nose. She&#39;d really learned how to get under his skin. He stood motionless, lips flattened, thinking. Then, he went upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Vincent entered their bedroom, he began rifling through the drawers. He didn&#39;t buy her claim.Even if she hadn&#39;t worn the jewelry he gave her lately, she must&#39;ve brought those pieces here.She had once treated them like treasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no matter how much he searched, there was hardly a hint of her presence left in this room. Except for a few garments in the wardrobe, none of it belonged to her now. Especially not any jewelry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression hardened.Hannah had drawn the line clearly. Once declaring she wouldn&#39;t live in this room anymore, she&#39;d have removed almost every trace of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since there was no jewelry here, she must&#39;ve taken those pieces to the guest room. He crossed the hallway in swift strides and flung open the guest door without bothering to knock. It wasn&#39;t locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah wasn&#39;t in sight. The water running in the bathroom made it clear-she was showering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent glanced around. The setup looked temporary, like someone who had no intention of staying long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had meant to inspect the drawers, but something on the desk caught his attention-a large branded bag. He lifted it and peeked inside. A neatly folded indigo suit jacket lay within, complete with cufflinks and a matching tie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, every trace of anger faded away. His eyes lit up, and a grin tugged at his lips. So, the suit wasn&#39;t for Felix. It had been meant for him.</p>
