                <p>A tightness gripped Vincent&#39;s throat, so he tried steering the conversation away. &#34;Grandma, maybe it&#39;s time for you to rest.Aubrey-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp glare from Sharon cut him off. &#34;Only call for Aubrey when it&#39;s convenient for you, huh? Don&#39;t bother.I&#39;m not leaving this spot until my granddaughter-in-law is back in this house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening from the sidelines, Brinley could only seethe as Sharon repeated &#34;your wife&#34; and &#34;my granddaughter-in-law,&#34; all pointing at Hannah. The words burned, each one a reminder of what she believed should have belonged to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hannah won&#39;t be coming back,&#34; Vincent remarked with a frustrated sigh. &#34;Didn&#39;t Derek say he couldn&#39;t find her?&#34; A frown creased his face. &#34;She&#39;s been running around for days. I have no idea when she&#39;ll bother to return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon fixed him with a pointed look. &#34;That&#39;s because she wanted to steer clear of you. I have already rang her up. She promised she&#39;d come back soon,&#34; she said, clearly enjoying the upper hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fresh wave of irritation settled over Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, meaningful smile curved Sharon&#39;s lips. &#34;Hannah really cares about me. She actually listens, unlike my grandson, who tunes me out completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent felt each word hit home, their sting impossible to shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley, sensing the tension, was about to speak-when the door opened. Hannah walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s shoulders tensed, and her words dried up instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One step into the living room, Hannah paused, surprised by the presence of Vincent and Brinley. She had assumed they wouldn&#39;t be here, but since they looked perfectly at ease, she decided not to back down.After all, she wasn&#39;t the shameless homewrecker or the unfaithful spouse here.She did nothing wrong to be uneasy about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while back, after saying goodbye to Rena post-gala, Hannah had gotten a call from Sharon,asking her to come home, and she hadn&#39;t hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s eyes barely left Hannah from the moment she crossed the entrance-barely noticeable,but persistent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching his stare from the corner of her eye, Hannah made a point of ignoring him entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sharon, I&#39;m home,&#34; Hannah called out, her return motivated by a desire to spare Sharon, already in her seventies, from the stress of watching her and Vincent&#39;s mnarriage unravel. She had assumed that Vincent and Brinley would be away, but seeing them here didn&#39;t bother her in the slightest. There were only eight days left. After that, she and Vincent would have nothing to do with each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, Hannah&#39;s focus was on Sharon and nothing else. &#34;How abouta walk, Sharon? Let&#39;s get some air,&#34;she suggested warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle laugh, Sharon waved off the idea.&#34;Why rush? Didn&#39;t you mention you had planned for my birthday? Now that everyone&#39;s gathered, show us what you&#39;ve got.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking charge, Sharon tugged Hannah down beside her, wedging Hannah right between herself and Vincent. Hannah&#39;s leg brushed against Vincent&#39;s due to the limited space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Discomfort flashed through Hannah as she shot to her feet, unable to hide the look of distaste thatcrossed her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Expression tight and cold, Vincent said nohing, simply staring at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mood was plain to see. Hannah felt it, but didn&#39;t let it touch her. No more would she let his moods decide her actions. That included something as simple as sitting within arm&#39;s reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a pleasant smile, Hannah excused herself. &#34;I&#39;Il be right back, Sharon. Just need to grab my laptop,&#34; she said, already heading for the stairs as she was eager to put some distance between herself and Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried to her room, heading straight for the desk. The curtains were drawn and the lights were off,casting the room in a dim hush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about the layout seemed to have changed, but she didn&#39;t pay it much attention.</p>
