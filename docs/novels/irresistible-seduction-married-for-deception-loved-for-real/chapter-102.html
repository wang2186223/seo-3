                <p>Messages flooded the group chat, each more inflammatory than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent scrolled through them, his face unreadable but for the sharp line of his jaw and a muscle ticking in his cheek. Without a word, he summoned the legal team and thrust his phone at the nearest attorney.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The company attorney accepted it with clammy hands, nerves spiking-why would the CEO hand over his phone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s voice cut through the tension, cold and absolute. &#34;File lawsuits against everyone in that group chat for spreading rumors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attorney tensed, curious what messages in a group chat could rattle the CEO so badly. Leaning in,he scanned the group members and immediately felt  cold sweat trickle down his spine. Those weren&#39;t nobodies but heirs to Dorbarrow&#39;s most powerful families.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attorney cleared his throat, voice wavering.&#34;Mr.Jones,are you absolutely certain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent slammed his pen onto the contract, leaned back in his leather chair, and shot the attorney a razor-sharp look. &#34;Yeah. Is that going to be an issue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glacial look swept across Vincent&#39;s face, slicing through the air like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bead of cold sweat rolled down the attorney&#39;s temple. &#34;Not at all.I am on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent offered no further instructions, so the attorney quickly made his exit, moving with the caution of someone tiptoeing past a sleeping predator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All afternoon, Vincent remained in a foul mood.Anyone unlucky enough to enter his office found themselves on the receiving end of his wrath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By four, he&#39;d had enough. Lingering in the office wouldn&#39;t change much since his mind always wandered to Hannah, his efficiency affected. Leaving work early, he drove straight home-only to find no sign of Hannah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He loosened his subtly patterned tie, barely masking his irritation, and called out to the housekeeper,&#34;Where is my wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She still hasn&#39;t returned,&#34; Aubrey replied, her voice careful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression darkened further, the tension in the foyer ratcheting up another notch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried to add, &#34;Your mother set off shopping with Miss Gilbert and ought to be home shortly.Meanwhile, your grandmother went out to play chess with a few friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s gaze stayed heavy. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that&#39;s everything, I&#39;ll go back to work,&#34; she said slipping away as quietly as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey had barely taken a step before Vincent&#39;s voice cut through the quiet once more. &#34;Has my wife been returning home late recently?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drifted toward the sofa, dropped into its cushions,and started undoing his cuffs, each motion deliberate, his features set in a frosty mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey hesitated and then answered honestly, &#34;Yes.But only a little earlier than you each time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The temperature in the air seemed to plummet.Vincent&#39;s glare sharpened, and a chill settled over the whole place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to ease the tension, Aubrey brought over a glass of juice, placing it within easy reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent ignored it, perching on the living room sofa as he stared at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley and Danica were the first to return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley, spotting Vincent home early for once,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>brightened instantly and slipped onto the sofa beside him, launching into breezy small talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By seven o&#39;clock, as dinner beckoned, Sharon strolled back through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent claimed his lack of appetite and skipped the meal, crossing his arms on the sofa and keeping his gaze on the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By eight o&#39;clock, Danica wNas deep in conversation with Brinley, while Vincent remained anchored to the same spot, eyes unwavering, waiting for Hannah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Sharon had gone to bed at nine, Brinley lingered, offering to keep Vincent company. But he waved her off with a sharp, impatient gesture,sending her upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was five past ten when the door finally opened and Hannah stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent had been waiting on the living room sofa all this time, a storm brewing in his eyes as she finally came back. &#34;Do you even know what time it is? You still remember this is your home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s mind had spun with details about Nova Tech&#39;s product line, so absorbed that she didn&#39;t register Vincent&#39;s presence in the living room.The unexpected sound of his voice jolted her out of her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And honestly, she couldn&#39;t fathom what right he had to question her like this. It was just ten o&#39;clock-what was the big deal? And she&#39;d already let Sharon know she&#39;d be back. And hadn&#39;t he himself stayed out all night before?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her irritation flared. &#34;It&#39;s just after ten. Don&#39;t act like I&#39;ve been out all night. And since when do you clock my curfew?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His scowl deepened, a muscle ticking in his jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to indulge him, Hannah turned toward the stairs, but Vincent moved first, planting himself in front of her, blocking her path with silent, simmering anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brittle sigh escaped her lips as her irritation edged into her voice. &#34;Now what do,you want from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in, eyes narrowing. &#34;So you&#39;ve been with Felix all this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully, she had. The hormone-monitoring wristband design was at a critical phase-there couldn&#39;t be any room for error.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting his glare head-on, Hannah didn&#39;t even blink.&#34;Yes. I was with him the whole time. Satisfied?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s face clouded over, his jaw flexing as he tried to hold back something sharper. &#34;Is this all just to rile me up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned, completely thrown. &#34;What are you even talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His frustration boiled over. &#34;First, you accepted the bracelet he picked out for you. Then, you go out and buy him a suit. What&#39;s next, candlelit dinners? Aren&#39;t you just deliberately trying to make me jealous?Maybe try acting your age.&#34; He grabbed her wrist with a sudden, angry movement, turning it until the bracelet flashed in the light. &#34;Do you have any idea what people are saying? The rumor mill thinks you&#39;ve bagged yourself a new benefactor.&#34;</p>
