                <p>Vincent pivoted, his gaze sharpening as he caught sight of Hannah through the glossy storefront. She stood inches from Felix, fingertips smoothing the lapel of his suit with practiced care, their proximity laced with a warmth that could only belong to lovers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow crossed Vincent&#39;s face. He pushed open the glass door and strode toward the store, radiating a quiet intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley noticed the shift and, with a knowing smirk,slipped in right after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, inside the store, Hannah insisted that the clerk fetch every possible shade of deep indigo suit in Felix&#39;s size as she tried to purchase one similar to that lent by Miles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Felix finally emerged from the fitting room, his tie hung askew, and Hannah immediately rose on tiptoe, fingers deft as she adjusted the knot against his.chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix froze under her touch, breath hitching,awkwardness etched into every line of his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This one&#39;s too loose,&#34; Hannah remarked, appraising the suit with a critical eye. The cut reminded her of the suit Miles had lent her, though this one, she thought wryly, couldn&#39;t compete in either craftsmanship or sentiment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she mulled it over, the piercing chime of the door shattered her thoughts. A man swept inside,his presence electric with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah picked up a smaller suit, ready to hand it to Felix to try on, but a hand seized her and pulled her roughly against a broad, unyielding chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent-unmistakable. She jerked her head up,her breath catching. Vincent? A second later, she noticed Brinley following close behind and pieced it together instantly-Vincent had brought Brinley along for shopping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah tore herself free, putting several feet between her and Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent stood rooted to the spot, his gaze sharp as a blade, brimming with hurt and rage. His jaw tightened, voice cutting and cold. &#34;So you&#39;re out buying clothes for another man, Hannah? Do I mean nothing to you now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each breath he took was heavy, chest heaving as anger twisted across his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix interjected with a steady, measured tone, &#34;Mr.Jones, maybe we should hear everyone out before making any accusations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!&#34; Vincent shot back, not sparing him a glance. His attention was locked on Hannah, gaze unyielding.&#34;Explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A humorless smirk curled at the edge of Hannah&#39;s lips. &#34;You saw everything. What more do you need to hear?&#34; Brinley glided forward, her voice soft and soothing,stepping neatly into the tension. &#34;Vincent, please,don&#39;t work yourself up. It could all be a misunderstanding. Hannah, just tell him what really happened-don&#39;t be so quick to shut him out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, Brinley seized the chance to project herself as gentle and understanding while subtly undermining Hannah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s laughter was low and sharp. &#34;You really do love playing the reasonable voice, don&#39;t you? But whatever&#39;s going on here is between me and Vincent. You really don&#39;t get a say in it since you&#39;re just a shameless homewrecker.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Hannah didn&#39;t raise her voice, every word cut through the air, drawing stares from a cluster of nearby shoppers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley flinched under the judgmental gazes,tears threatening to spill as she instinctively sought out Vincent for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s eyes went cold. He fixed Hannah with a look that could freeze fire, jaw clenched tight.&#34;That&#39;s enough, Hannah. Don&#39;t test me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah barely flinched. She&#39;d long since grown numb to Vincent&#39;s instinctive move of shielding Brinley, no matter the circumstance. Stone-faced,her voice edged with frost, she said, &#34;This is how l talk. Don&#39;t like it? There&#39;s the door. Kindly leave us alone. We have things to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hollow sound escaped Vincent, something closer to a bark than a laugh. &#34;Last time you were busy napping in his office. Now you&#39;re handpicking suits.What&#39;s next, a cozy family dinner at his place?&#34; He felt she was deliberately getting under his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words drew even more attention from bystanders in the store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix&#39;s expression tightened in disapproval, while Brinley-back turned to the crowd-couldn&#39;t suppress a tiny, smug curve of her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah caught Vincent&#39;s glare, his voice sharp with accusation. For a fleeting second, she saw a reflection of the hysterical version of herself from the past. The difference was-hers came from love. His outburst, though, reeked of nothing but wounded ego. But it didn&#39;t matter anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah fixed Vincent with a frosty, unflinching stare,refusing to waste even a single word in reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment broke as the sales assistant returned,arms full of suits arranged with meticulous care. &#34;Ms.Scott, I&#39;ve brought the rest of the indigo options for your boyfriend to try on.&#34;</p>
