                <p>Barely had Margaret answered the call before a harsh voice came barreling through the receiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just how thick-skinned are you, Hannah? Still pushing Sharon to host a lavish lunch for your parents? What&#39;s the deal-are they really that eager to set foot in a rich family&#39;s house like ours?Honestly, calling you shameless doesn&#39;t even scratch the surface. You&#39;re not just shameless. You&#39;re foolish, and worse, you know exactly how to twist things to get what you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tirade hit Margaret like a slap, leaving her momentarily speechless. Was this woman actually insulting Hannah?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rushed to Margaret&#39;s cheeks, but she fought to steady her voice. &#34;Excuse me. Who do you think you are, speaking about my daughter that way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat of silence hung between them. Danica,caught off guard, realized she was speaking to Hannah&#39;s mother but didn&#39;t mince her words. &#34;So what if I insulted her? What I said is true. Isn&#39;t it typical of a low-class family to raise such a grasping,shallow daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain and anger twisted in Margaret&#39;s chest. She dug her nails into her palm but kept her voice even. &#34;You know nothing about my child. Hannah has more decency in her little finger than you could ever understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in the speaker&#39;s tone, arrogance mixed with cold contempt, told Margaret everything she needed to know. This must be Hannah&#39;s mother-in-law. Righteous fury rose in Margaret&#39;s voice. &#34;If we&#39;re comparing mothers, I&#39;d say you&#39;ve failed more spectacularly. How else would you explain a son like Vincent, who can&#39;t even manage basic manners?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; Danica fumed, all bluster and outrage. The resemblance to Hannah&#39;s stubbornness was almost uncanny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for another insult, Margaret ended the call and let the phone drop to her lap. She glanced toward the living room where Raymond and Hannah were still chatting about his outfit, blissfully unaware. Part of her wanted to suggest cancelling the visit. Wouldn&#39;t it be easier to skip the Jones family estate and simply enjoy Dorbarrow together,just the three of them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Danica&#39;s words lingered in Margaret&#39;s mind, sour and sharp. What sort of world had her daughter been living in all these years?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each passing moment tightened the ache in Margaret&#39;s chest, yet her curiosity grew stronger. No word of the conversation left her lips, but the spark of anticipation was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From across the room, Hannah noticed her mother&#39;s shift in mood and guessed she was still upset about the uncertainty of seeing Vincent. Slipping an arm around Margaret&#39;s shoulders, she spoke softly. &#34;It&#39;ll be fine, Mom. Vincent will show up for lunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was what Sharon had told her. With his grandmother&#39;s word as law, Hannah felt sure Vincent wouldn&#39;t dare refuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing those words, Raymond&#39;s spirits lifted, and a broad, genuine smile creased his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret, on the other hand, managed only a faint nod, her expression revealinglittle of what she truly felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They made their way to the Jones estate with Hannah at the wheel, a carefully wrapped gift nestled in her lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arriving at the gates, they found Sharon already waiting for them, her presence dignified and welcoming, with several staff members at her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scale and formality of the greeting left both Raymond and Margaret slightly awed and a bit unsure of themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for Sharon&#39;s arm, Hannah offered a warm introduction. &#34;These are my parents, Sharon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Mrs. Jones.&#34; Raymond and Margaret greeted her and then passed their gift to a waiting attendant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon welcomed them with a radiant smile. &#34;I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re here. For years, l&#39;ve hoped for this moment. If my health were better, I&#39;d have visited you myself to thank you for raising such a wonderful daughter. We&#39;re so fortunate to have her in our lives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raymond,caught off guard by such genuine praise,could only stutter, &#34;Thank you. That&#39;s very kind of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep inside, relief washed over him. Any lingering doubts or nasty rumors of his daughter being a kept woman evaporated-his daughter was clearly respected and valued here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret, moved nearly to tears, felt the tension in her chest finally ease. With Sharon watching over Hannah, maybe things wouldn&#39;t be so hard for Hannah after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pointing at a woman nearby, Sharon continued,&#34;This is Vincent&#39;s mother,Danica.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An icy smile flickered across Danica&#39;s lips as she forced a greeting. &#34;Hello.&#34; Her reluctance was obvious. She had come only at Sharon&#39;s insistence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition flashed in Margaret&#39;s eyes the instant she heard that voice. The memory of that earlier phone call-and the insults-came flooding back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maintaining her composure, Sharon&#39;s presence remained steady and authoritative. &#34;Vincent should arrive soon,&#34; she announced, smiling at Hannah&#39;s parents. &#34;Shall we start lunch while we wait?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raymond offered a polite response. &#34;That sounds wonderful. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the dining room, a lavish spread awaited.Sharon herself guided Hannah&#39;s parents to their seats, ensuring they felt included.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica took the seat farthest from Raymond and Margaret, fanning her hand in front of her face.&#34;My God, is that musty thrift-store smell coming from them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air thickened instantly. The conversation stopped. Raymond and Margaret stiffened,trying to hide their discomfort and wounded pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Hannah could uttera word in protest, Sharon placed a firm, reassuring hand on her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cool, commanding gaze, Sharon looked straight at Danica. &#34;If you&#39;re not in the mood to join us, you&#39;re welcome to excuse yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dramatic sigh, Danica poured herself a generous glass of wine. &#34;I suppose that was out of line. Let&#39;s call it water under the bridge. I&#39;ll drink to make up for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon&#39;s stern features relaxed a shade, though her gaze never fully softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning curiosity, Danica flashed a smile that didn&#39;t reach her eyes. &#34;So, you&#39;re both retired from teaching,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret&#39;s response came quietly, eyes guarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raymond, however, straightened with a hint of pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right. Teaching was our passion for many years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint of mischief danced in Danica&#39;s eyes as she pressed on. &#34;Tell me, what sort of pension does that career earn you these days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put together, it&#39;s a bit over ten thousand,&#34; Raymond answered honestly. That amount had always been enough for them to live without worry-they&#39;d never relied on Hannah to get by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp, mirthless laugh burst from Danica. &#34;Ten thousand? My goodness, that wouldn&#39;t even buy a single handbag from my collection!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swept a hand toward the table, her tone turning careless. &#34;Watch out for the silverware,would you?Each piece is worth more than a teacher&#39;s salary for a year. Break one, and you&#39;d spend the rest of your life paying it off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassment flickered across Raymond&#39;s and Margaret&#39;s faces as they exchanged an uneasy glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s hands curled into fists beneath the linen,her chest tightening at the cruelty of it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An icy edge sliced through Sharon&#39;s patience.&#34;Danica, that&#39;s enough. Go upstairs.&#34; The reprimand set off a sudden fit of coughing, her anger unmistakable.</p>
