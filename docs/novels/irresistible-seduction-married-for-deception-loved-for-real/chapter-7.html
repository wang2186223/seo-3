                <p>Once picking up Hannah and taking her to her place Rena arranged things with quiet efficiency. She made sure Hannah had everything she could possibly need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of friendship since their college days meant Rena knew the whole story-from Hannah&#39;s first date with Vincent to the unraveling of their marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the fresh linens were in place, Rena glanced over her shoulder and handed Hannah a pilloW.&#34;You&#39;re really done with Vincent this time, aren&#39;t you?No going back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Hannah took the pillow and nodded. &#34;Yes. Even the idea of going back makes my skin crawl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instant approval flashed in Rena&#39;s eyes. &#34;You deserve better, you know that. I never saw what you did in him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no hesitation in Rena&#39;s voice-she&#39;d always been against Vincent. Watching Hannah leave him felt like watching someone finally wake up from a bad dream. Anyone who met Hannah couldn&#39;t miss her striking looks-tall, elegant, skin like porcelain,and hair that caught the light in soft amber waves.She had the kind of presence that turned heads, so why spend another second on a man who never valued her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena broke the brief silence. &#34;Alright, what&#39;s your next move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determination flared in Hannah&#39;s eyes. &#34;It&#39;s simple.I&#39;m bringing Nova Tech back. That&#39;s my only focus now.&#34; She paused and then looked hopeful. &#34;Actually Rena, do you have a way to help me connect with Miles Whitaker-the CEO of VitraMind?&#34; If there was ever a person to open doors in the elite&#39;s world,it was Rena. Her connections seemed endless, though even she sometimes hit a wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that name, Rena had frowned for the first time all night. &#34;Miles isn&#39;t easy to reach. Best I can do is find out where he&#39;ll be and when.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah smiled, grateful. &#34;That&#39;s more than enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night stretched on as the two friends talked about everything and nothing, until Rena finally drifted off to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alone in the quiet, Hannah nursed a beer, her thoughts involuntarily spiraling back to Vincent. How did things between them end up like this? All these years together, he&#39;d never really opened his heart to her. He hadn&#39;t even offered a single explanation for treating her as a stand-in. Nobody could call this anything but a farce. Deep down, she understood.She&#39;d never truly mattered to him. Love had never been part of the equation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears stung her eyes, but she brushed them away with a shaky hand. Right then, she made herself a promise: this would be the last time she&#39;d cried over Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning sunlight found Danica hunching over a chessboard with Brinley as her opponent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere,Danica&#39;s phone buzzed. Hannah&#39;s name lit up the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing the game, Danica flashed the caller ID toward Brinley before answering. &#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are the property transfer procedures done?&#34;Hannah&#39;s voice sounded rough, as if she hadn&#39;t slept at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick exchange of looks passed between Danica and Brinley. &#34;Of course not. Only three went through,&#34; Danica responded, her words crisp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hand those over first,&#34; Hannah replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, just swing by when you get a chance.&#34;Leaning back, Danica remarked, deliberately sounding casual, &#34;By the way, I heard you moved out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of Vincent&#39;s late-night phone call about whether Hannah had come to her place and his  anxious tone flashed through Danica&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Hannah answered and then ended the call without a moment&#39;s pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica frowned at the blank screen. &#34;How rude,&#34; she muttered to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment Danica looked at Brinley, her lips curled into a smile. &#34;Anyway, their divorce is done.Hannah&#39;s moving out just suits you. Things get a whole lot easier for you to grow close to Vincent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley dropped her gaze with mock shyness and played with a strand of hair, but her tone betrayed her smugness. &#34;You know, Mrs. Jones, there&#39;s still plenty of road ahead for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinning wide, Danica could barely contain her excitement.&#34;Won&#39;t be long now. I can already picture you as part of the family.&#34; A dramatic sigh escaped her lips. &#34;The real tragedy is having to sign away so many properties to Hannah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An eager glimmer flashed in Brinley&#39;s eyes. &#34;I might  be able to help you keep what&#39;s yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity sparked immediately across Danica&#39;s face.&#34;Really? How?&#34; Choosing Brinley as her future daughter-in-law suddenly felt like the best decision she&#39;d ever made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, Hannah stopped by Danica&#39;s place to collect the property paperwork. Expecting Danica,she ran into Brinley instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,look who itBrinley remarked, her voice as sweet as honey but her smile sharp as a knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Hannah kept moving, clutching her phone and heading straight for the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley wasn&#39;t finished. &#34;At Gilded Restaurant the other day, you heard me and Vincent make out in the private room,didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Hannah shot her a glare. &#34;So? Wrecking someone else&#39;s marriage-does that really make you proud of yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of discomfort crossed Brinley&#39;s face before she smoothed it over with a fresh smile. &#34;If I hadn&#39;t walked away back then, you&#39;d never have had your shot with him.&#34; Drawing closer, she lowered her voice. &#34;You want to know what Vincent told me during our encounters? He said you just lie there,stiff as a board, making him do all the work and stripping him of any pleasure from having sex with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Hannah raised her phone, the screen lit up to show an active call. Her expression turned ice-cold. &#34;Vincent, is that what you really tell your mistress about me?&#34;</p>
