                <p>Vincent&#39;s features clouded over, tension gathering between his brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reassurance came from Vincent, leaving Brinley cold with uncertainty. She took one last desperate chance. &#34;Vincent, you don&#39;t believe me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wall of silence met her plea. Vincent&#39;s eyes revealed nothing, his thoughts locked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching a glimpse of his profile, Hannah searched for a clue, but his expression stayed closed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dread pooled in Brinley&#39;s stomach. Did this mean Vincent was giving up on her? Her voice cracked as she called out, &#34;Vincent... Please...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Authority rang through the officer&#39;s voice.&#34;Ms. Gilbert, you are sentenced to administrative detention.You&#39;ll be held for fifteen days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had the officer spoken than two more approached to take Brinley by the arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching her chest, Brinley gasped for breath. &#34;Vincent, I can&#39;t breathe... My heart-it really hurts...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, she crumpled to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos erupted as everyonescrambled toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quick to react, Vincent swept her into his arms, voice shaking as he screamed, &#34;To the hospital! Now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never before had Hannah seen him look so utterly frantic. The fear in his eyes was a revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Hannah understood what set love apart from indifference. No tears came-she only pressed her lips together, numb as she observed the scene unravel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, she finished her final statement and slipped out of the police station alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashing red lights carried them to Dorbarrow Hospital, where Brinley was whisked into emergency care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attending physician shot Vincent a hard stare. &#34;She has a serious heart condition. Don&#39;t you know that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another two minutes, and we could&#39;ve lost her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent stood as if turned to stone. He tried to process it. Brinley had been living with a heart condition all along? Suddenly, her previous words of being sick with no one by her side when she was abroad flashed back to his mind. So, she&#39;d been plagued by this serious illness?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor&#39;s tone left no room for argument. &#34;You must protect her from any emotional distress. Her heart can&#39;t handle much more. You need to keep her calm at all times.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a few more instructions rattled off, the doctor stepped away, leaving Vincent reeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent lingered by the doorway, memories pulling him backward. He could see himself as a boy of seven,watching from the shore while the ocean claimed both Brinley&#39;s father and her brother. He could barely breathe as waves of self-reproach, remorse, and sorrow rose and fell, making it hard to stand his ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours slipped by while he stayed rooted there, lost in that tide of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When daylight finally crept through the blinds, Brinley woke and found Vincent right by her side. She struggled to speak. &#34;Vincent, I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent stopped her before she could say more. &#34;Why did you keep your heart condition from me? This is serious. You should have told me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She muttered, &#34;I just didn&#39;t want you to worry. Most of the time, it&#39;s not so bad. As long as I stay calm, I can live a normal life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried more weight than usual. &#34;Heart disease isn&#39;t something to brush off. I&#39;m calling a specialist. You&#39;re getting a more detailed reassessment, and we&#39;ll set up a treatment plan that works.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flickered, and unease crept in. She hastily stopped him. &#34;Please don&#39;t make me go through with that, Vincent. I don&#39;t want any treatment. I don&#39;t want to be separated from you. My father and brother are already gone... What if I don&#39;t survive the surgery?&#34; Tears slipped down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s resolve softened as he watched her cry. &#34;Then focus on feeling better for now. If things get worse,have a specialist check on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bit of relief flickered across Brinley&#39;s face as she agreed. &#34;Alright.&#34; Her fingers trembled as she reached for his, &#34;Vincent, please believe me-l was set up. I really don&#39;t know those two men. I would never do anything to damage my own name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated and then gently pulled away. &#34;Let me handle this. You just concentrate on getting better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile crossed her lips. &#34;Alright. I promise, I&#39;Il take care of myseIf. You don&#39;t have to worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent offered a quiet nod, not quite meeting her eyes. When he finished giving her a few last reminders,he left her to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Derek sent Vincent a message. &#34;Mr. Jones, should we keep digging?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent sent a quick reply. &#34;Stop. That&#39;s enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent knew sorting out Brinley&#39;s situation meant he had to begin with Hannah. His first move was to call her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at home, Hannah was focused on finalizing details for Sharon&#39;s birthday party plan. The moment Vincent&#39;s name appeared on her phone, she hit decline without missing a beat. A second call came through,but she rejected it again, just as quickly. Her solution to his ongoing calls was to silence her phone altogether.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, Vincent stormed back and appeared at her doorway, his patience frayed. &#34;Why wouldn&#39;t you answer me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just didn&#39;t want to.&#34; Hannah didn&#39;t even look up from her work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned against the frame of the doorway, exhaustion dragging at his features. His words were strained from lack of sleep. &#34;We need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flickered with annoyance. &#34;What is there left to say? It&#39;s about Brinley, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With less edge in his tone, Vincent tried to reason with her. &#34;She&#39;s already admitted she made a mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah rolled her eyes. Of course, it was about Brinley. A humorless chuckle escaped her. &#34;What,now she needs you to apologize on her behalf?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent didn&#39;t respond to the jab, choosing instead to cut to the chase.&#34;L_et&#39;s just drop this whole thing.&#34;</p>
