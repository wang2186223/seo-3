                <p>Raymond&#39;s face clouded over at Clive&#39;s harsh words.&#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raymond exchanged a glance with Margaret, an inexplicable sinking feeling passing between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Folding his arms across his chest, Clive let out a sharp, humorless laugh. &#34;You two really believe Hannah married our CEO? That&#39;s almost funny. Let me break it down for you-your daughter has never been anything more than a mistress. Not a girlfriend,not a wife. For nearly five years, she&#39;s been living off Mr.Jones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No effort was made to cushion his words. &#34;If you want to know the truth, maybe you should ask yourselves how she ended up chasing money instead of building a real career. Instead of earning an honest living, she chose the easy road and became his kept woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret erupted, her voice trembling with rage.&#34;That&#39;s not true! Don&#39;t you dare insult her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock hit Raymond so hard that he nearly lost his breath. Instinctively, Margaret reached over and rubbed his back until he calmed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, struggling to steady his voice, Raymond said,&#34;Our daughter worked hard and graduated from a top university. What gives you the right to slander her like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years spent as respected teachers had never prepared Raymond and Margaret for anything like this. Retirement had been peaceful back home until rumors about Vincent and his first love started to spread online. The stories unsettled them enough to travel all the way to Dorbarrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d hoped for answers, maybe even a long-overdue meeting with their son-in-law after their daughter&#39;s five-year marriage. Instead, they were hit with an avalanche of doubt. It was unthinkable. Could their daughter really have been lying to them all these years?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a look of thinly veiled contempt, Clive answered, &#34;All that education doesn&#39;t change reality.She&#39;s not working a real job, and Mr. Jones has dumped her. But she&#39;s still hanging around,desperate to get him back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain flickered across Margaret&#39;s face. &#34;He broke up with her?&#34; The words felt heavy in her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A careless shrug was all Clive gave. &#34;Yeah. Mr. Jones is back with his first love, and they&#39;re practically inseparable. They&#39;re traveling abroad right now. As for Hannah, she&#39;s no longer part of his life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revelation left Raymond and Margaret stunned,paralyzed by the realization that everything they&#39;d believed might have been a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not another word was spared for the devastated couple as Clive walked away, heading back to his routine as if nothing significant had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught in heavy traffic, Hannah finally arrived at the Jones Group headquarters, nerves already frayed.Entering the lobby, she immediately spotted her parents sitting alone, their faces clouded with sadness and confusion. No part of her expected Vincent to show up, not after everything that had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching quietly, Hannah noticed just how shaken her parents looked. Hands clasped together,she spoke softly. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you let me know you were coming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret seemed ready to answer, but Raymond raised a hand, signaling her to stay silent. A stern gaze fixed on Hannah, he spoke with no room for argument. &#34;Bring us to your husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension crept into Hannah&#39;s posture. The last thing she wanted was for her parents to become entangled with Vincent. &#34;He&#39;s swamped at work these days.Meeting now isn&#39;t possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unmoved, Raymond&#39;s voice turned even more insistent. &#34;Call him. I want to speak with him myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornered by her father&#39;s persistence, Hannah reached for her phone and dialed Vincent&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once went to voicemail. No reply. A second call-still nothing. By the third ring, it was clear he wasn&#39;t going to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Familiar disappointment flickered in Hannah&#39;s eyes.&#34;See? He&#39;s busy,&#34; she said, forcing her features to remain calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least let us visit his office,&#34; Raymond added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic threatened to surface on Hannah&#39;s face.Almost nobody at the Jones Group knew she was Vincent&#39;s rightful wife. To them, she was just a mistress, never acknowledged in public. If her parents ever learned that, anger wouldn&#39;t be the worst of it. Their hearts would break right in two. She knew she couldn&#39;t handle the sight of that-not now,not ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should just head home for now,&#34; Hannah suggested quickly. &#34;Maybe we can tour his office another day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for her father&#39;s arm, she tried gently to guide him toward the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Raymond pulled away from her, a deep disappointment coloring his words. &#34;You&#39;re still keeping things from us. Hannah, is this how we raised you?&#34;</p>
