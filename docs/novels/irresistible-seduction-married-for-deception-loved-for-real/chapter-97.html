                <p>Hannah paused for a split second before catching on to the message behind Felix&#39;s words. A quick grin crossed her face as she beckoned to the store clerk,wanting to take off the bracelet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle interruption from Felix stopped the clerk from approaching. &#34;Leave it on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion flickered across Hannah&#39;s face. &#34;Shouldn&#39;t I take it off? I thought this was for someone else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a shy rub at his neck, Felix admitted, &#34;It is for someone. That someone is you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words caught Hannah off guard, making her freeze. &#34;Wait, what?&#34; Why would Felix suddenly be giving her a present?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eager to clear things up, Felix continued, &#34;Remember how I promised you a reward for your hard work?This is it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slightly embarrassed laugh slipped from Hannah.&#34;Oh...I misunderstood...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix leaned in, curious. &#34;Misunderstood how?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze dropped to the bracelet as she fiddled with it. &#34;I assumed lunch was my reward. But honestly,this bracelet is gorgeous.I really love it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix masked his disappointment, a gentle smile returning. &#34;I&#39;m glad you like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exchanged a glance with the clerk, mimed a payment gesture, and then led Hannah out of the shop, the bracelet still shining on her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plans to return to the office faded when Hannah came to an abrupt stop in front of a men&#39;s suit boutique on the third floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix gave her a curious glance. &#34;Something catch your eye?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to take a look at some suits,&#34; Hannah replied,already making her way inside. Felix kept pace, right on her heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s with the sudden interest in men&#39;s suits?&#34; His tone was light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sheepish smile crept across Hannah&#39;s face. &#34;You remember Miles Whitaker? He lent me his jacket once, and I ended up losingit. I need to find a replacement to return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every detail of the original suit-pattern, fabric,cut-remained vivid in her memory as she sifted through the display options.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34; Felix gave a simple nod, offering quiet company as she searched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The only issue,&#34; Hannah continued, &#34;is I&#39;m not sure of Miles&#39;s exact measurements. You two are built pretty similarly, though. Mind being my stand-in for sizing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him a quick, appraising once-over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grin spread across Felix&#39;s face. &#34;I&#39;m all yours-use me for a fit test.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Brinley had taken Vincent all the way to Silvercrest Mall, the drive alone costing ten minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glance at his watch, and Vincent&#39;s frown deepened. &#34;There&#39;s a luxury mall right next to the Jones Group building. What&#39;s the point of coming all the way out here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley flashed a bright smile. &#34;This mall is brand new, Vincent. They might carry something really exclusive. Just give it a look with me, please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ten minutes. That&#39;s all,&#34; Vincent warned, making no effort to hide his impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely,&#34; she replied, though she had no intention of sticking to his time limit. The moment he caught sight of Hannah shopping around with Felix,she doubted he&#39;d care about how long they stayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Hannah refused to keep her distance from Felix, Brinley figured she couldn&#39;t be blamed. She was merely giving things a little extra push.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s hands drifted from display to display,but her thoughts never lingered on the merchandise.Every few seconds, her eyes darted to the entrances of each store,searching for Hannah and Felix.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent trailed Brinley from shop to shop, all the way up to the third floor, still empty-handed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another look at his watch, and his patience snapped -ten minutes had come and gone. He&#39;d had enough.&#34;Brinley, take all the time you want picking something out. I have to get back to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley darted into Vincent&#39;s path, blocking his exit.&#34;Please don&#39;t leave yet, Vincent. You&#39;re already here.Just help me pick out a gift. I really want your grandmother to like me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone sounded earnest, but her gaze slid right past him. She was far more interested in the faces drifting by, intent on spotting Hannah and Felix in the crowd. This was the mall mentioned in the group chat, yet she hadn&#39;t caught even a glimpse of them.Maybe they&#39;d missed their window-or perhaps the two had already slipped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s irritation was building, and he was on the verge of brushing past her when Brinley let out a sudden, dramatic gasp. &#34;Look over there-aren&#39;t those Hannah and Mr. Wade? What are they doing together at this mall?&#34;</p>
