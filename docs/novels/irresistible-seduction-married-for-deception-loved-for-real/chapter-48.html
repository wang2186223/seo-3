                <p>&#34;Drop this whole thing?&#34; Hannah snapped her laptop shut. &#34;Not a chance. Whatever happens between you and Brinley is none of my business. But after what she did, twisting the facts and dragging my name through the mud, I&#39;m taking this as far as it needs to go. If it calls for prosecution, then so be it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent worked at the knot of his tie, his eyes cool. &#34;I&#39;ll make it up to you. You&#39;ve been eyeing my mother&#39;s properties, right? I&#39;ll get them for you. I don&#39;t care how many units you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short, dry laugh slipped from Hannah. &#34;How generous of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to admit Brinley really was Vincent&#39;s irreplaceable first love-no amount of money was too much if it meant protecting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With arms crossed, Hannah shook her head. &#34;I&#39;m not interested in money or those properties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s frown deepened as her refusal hung in the air. &#34;My mind&#39;s made up,&#34; he said, his words leaving no room for argument. &#34;I&#39;ll have the charges withdrawn in your name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare!&#34; Hannah hadn&#39;t expected him to be so high-handed about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have .Derek handle it. This ends now.&#34; With that, Vincent turned and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hannah had no intention of letting it slide. She compiled all the evidence and submitted it directly to the court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Brinley, still lying in a hospital bed, received the court&#39;s official summons. All color drained from her face, shock written plainly in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica breezed in right then to check on her. Seeing Brinley&#39;s stricken look, she hurried to the bedside.&#34;Brinley, are you feeling worse? Is your heart acting up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trembling,Brinley held out the paper, tears smudging the ink. &#34;Mrs. Jones, look what Hannah&#39;s done. She&#39;s determined to ruin me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outrage flashed across Danica&#39;s face. &#34;She&#39;s actually suing you? She has no shame!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to help, Danica flattened the court summons on the table and reached for her phone. &#34;Give me a second. I&#39;ll send this to Vincent right away. He needs to know how Hannah&#39;s treating you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Masking her glee, Brinley pressed her lips together. &#34;Maybe we shouldn&#39;t let Vincent know about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You always take the gentle route, Brinley. Sometimes I wish you wouldn&#39;t,&#34; Danica said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Danica tapped her phone, sending the snapshot of the court summons straight to Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley felt a rush of satisfaction-just a few tears and a few words, and someone was already fighting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s call came through almost at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight smile, Danica tilted the phone so Brinley could see. &#34;Look at that. He called the second he saw the message.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Happiness crept across Brinley&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Danica picked up. Vincent&#39;s voice carried through the speaker. &#34;How&#39;s Brinley doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica wasted no time. &#34;Here, you can speak to her yourseIf,&#34; she said, passing the phone to Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley took the phone without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His concern was obvious as he asked, &#34;Is your heart still hurting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not anymore,&#34; Brinley answered instantly. &#34;I just got that court summons, and it rattled me a little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave it to me. I&#39;ll take care of everything,&#34; Vincent remarked, his tone gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Vincent,&#34; she replied softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the Jones Group headquarters, Vincent hung up and instantly dialed Hannah&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, she picked up almost instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s gotten the court summons, I take it?&#34; Hannah&#39;s voice was almost breezy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Areyou really going through with this lawsuit?&#34; Vincent asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her answer didn&#39;t waver. &#34;I am.&#34; After a pause, Vincent finally spoke, quieter this time. &#34;Brinley&#39;s health isn&#39;t good. She&#39;s got a heart condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, silence stretched between them before Hannah found her voice again. &#34;Vincent, if being sick was all it took to avoid facing the consequences, this world wouldn&#39;t be able to uphold justice. She dragged my name through the dirt first-don&#39;t I get to defend myself? Her health isn&#39;t my responsibility. Just because she&#39;s fragile doesn&#39;t mean I owe her mercy. If you&#39;re hoping I&#39;ll let it go out of pity, then I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unwavering and cool, her tone never slipped. She ended the call without hesitation right after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having resolved the legal matter-at least for the moment-Hannah felt lighter. Turning her attention to business, she began chatting with event organizers about Sharon&#39;s birthday banquet. In the middle of their conversation, her phone buzzed with unexpected news-the court had tossed out her case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, she called to ask for answers-only to learn that Vincent had interfered. Anger boiled over, and she fired off a message to him. &#34;You shameless bastard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started reaching out to courts in other regions, hoping one might hear her out. But every single one turned her away, calling the case &#34;exceptional&#34; and refusing to take it on. It was obvious now. Vincent was shielding Brinley from the consequences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah lowered her phone, her energy drained and her hope running low. With Vincent in the picture, there was no way Brinley would ever be prosecuted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah shifted her approach. She sent Vincent another message.&#34;1fyou want me to drop the lawsuit, fine.But Brinley has to post a public apology. Put it online where everyone can see. Do that, and I&#39;ll step away.lf not, I&#39;ll keep filing. Every single day. I&#39;ve got time, and I&#39;m not afraid to use it. And if the media catches wind of this-let&#39;s see who ends up being publicly disgraced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent didn&#39;t reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, as Hannah scrolled through Instagram, something caught her eye and made her freeze. Brinley had posted again-just one minute earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The post had three photos. A man in a suit, seen from behind; a hand pointing toward him; a massive bouquet of red roses. The caption read, &#34;The man I love came to see me again. And he brought me these beautiful flowers.&#34;</p>
