                <p>Vincent&#39;s brow furrowed. He looked at Hannah,clearly displeased. &#34;Do you have to talk like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah adjusted the jacket draped over her shoulders and raised an eyebrow. &#34;Did I say something wrong?&#34; A smirk curled her lips.ne woman after another-aren&#39;t you worried you&#39;ll wear yourself out? Would hate for fatigue to be your undoing,Mr.Jones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment sat poorly with Vincent. At what point had Hannah become this sharp-tongued? His eyes lingered on the jacket draped on her shoulder-obviously a man&#39;s, and definitely not his own. A wave of suspicion crashed over him. Was she here to see off some man at the airport? Clearing his throat, he asked, &#34;What are you doing at the airport?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With barely a glance back, Hannah let out a huff and strode away, making it clear she was done with the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the next second, Vincent strode forward and grabbed her wrist, &#34;Where do you think you&#39;re going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None of your business,&#34; Hannah snapped, her words clipped as she tried to twist out of his grasp.But he refused to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still making a fuss?&#34; Vincent asked, frustration clear in every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hollow, humorless laugh escaped Hannah. Making a fuss? She hadn&#39;t made a scene or harmed anyone -just kept all her pain to herself. Yet, somehow, he viewed her as immature, making a fuss. All at once,the fight in her faded. A heavy silence settled over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t make a fuss,&#34; Hannah finally said, her voice level and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent picked up on the change, his own tone softening. &#34;Let&#39;s head home. We need to talk this out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter laugh escaped from Hannah. &#34;Home? That word doesn&#39;t mean anything to us. To everyone else,I was never your wife-just a secret lover, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, she wasn&#39;t even a lover. She was just a stand-in for Brinley. And for five years, she&#39;d been kept in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met, her gaze heavy with pain,disappointment, and a thousand other feelings that words couldn&#39;t touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every bit of her heartbreak was written on her face,and Vincent saw it. The sight nearly closed up his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to leave again, but Vincent gripped her wrist even more tightly. He tugged her back, urging her toward his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His strength overpowered her resistance. Rage bubbled up inside her. Her arm flew out,accidentally connecting with his cheek in a sharp, stinging slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, the sound echoed around them.Hannah stood perfectly still, shocked by what she&#39;d just done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head slapped to the side, Vincent set his jaw and pressed his tongue to the inside of his cheek. His eyes narrowed, shadows flickering in their depths.&#34;Can we talk now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for an answer, he yanked her to the car and shoved her inside before slamming the door shut and speeding away before she could protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind them, Daphne Whitaker, Miles&#39; younger sister,watched from the curb, her mouth falling open as the car disappeared. &#34;Who was that woman? Did she really slap Mr. Jones?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby scoffed. &#34;Just some lover. Not worth mentioning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, silence hung thick inside the Bentley.Hannah turned her head, watching the outline of Vincent&#39;s cheek where her hand had landed. Her heart churned with regret. After all the years they&#39;d spent together, she&#39;d never once struck him-this was the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Vincent finally release her wrist,his gaze catching on the faint red line his grip had left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delicate skin had always betrayed Hannah&#39;s bruises.Every time they&#39;d been intimate, her body would be dotted with love marks, some lasting for days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His throat bobbed at the memory. Slowly, he reached over, brushing his thumb over the mark as if he could erase it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The touch jolted Hannah back to reality. She snatched her hand away. &#34;What exactly do you want to talk to me about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regaining his composure, Vincent answered,&#34;Grandma&#39;s seventieth birthday is coming up soon.You haven&#39;t forgotten, have you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I remember,&#34; she replied. Three weeks-that was all the time left. Once his grandmother&#39;s birthday celebration wrapped up, she would vanish from his world entirely and announce their divorce publicly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away, Hannah fixed her attention on the scenery outside. Her fingers absentmindedly traced the pale impression left by a wedding band that was no longer there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again and again, Vincent glanced over at her profile.Each time, a feeling of powerlessness crept in, like she was slipping out of his orboit and there was nothing he could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve always taken charge of Grandma&#39;s birthday plans,&#34; he said, his tone softening. &#34;Seventieth birthday is a big milestone. Do you have any ideas for the celebration?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s eyes dimmed slightly, though he tried to mask it. &#34;Maybe we could skip the big party this time.Something simple-a family dinner. I think that would mean a lot to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tired breath slipped from Hannah, her words scraping the air. &#34;You don&#39;t have to ask me, Vincent.There&#39;s probably someone out there who could do it better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s face clouded over in an instant. His eyes locked on hers as he demanded, &#34;And what&#39;s that supposed to mean? Are you telling me to divorce you and go marry another woman who handles the celebration?&#34;</p>
