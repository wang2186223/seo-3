                <p>Vincent tried calling again, but Hannah didn&#39;t even flinch-she blocked his number right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few moments later, just as Hannah was about to wash her face, her phone rang once more. This time,Rena&#39;s name lit up the screen. Hannah answered without a second thought. &#34;Rena, are you back in the country?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A playful and bright voice answered, &#34;Yep!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,Rena added, &#34;Oh, and by the way, do you know Victoria Hale?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah stopped in her tracks the moment she heard the name. &#34;What&#39;s got you bringing up Victoria all of a sudden?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria Hale had been Hannah&#39;s own alias during her college days, long before Vincent was part of her That part of her life had been her proudest. As Victoria, she&#39;d built and launched a pioneering website to help keep women safe. But the attention it attracted had soon turned sour. Online trolls and anonymous threats had spilled over into her real life,eventually forcing her to give up the alias. Still, she had never given up on the concept of women&#39;s safety design. Afterward, she&#39;d partnered with Felix and founded Nova Tech.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day Hannah re-entered the tech world, Felix had encouraged her to go public as Victoria. But she&#39;d turned down the idea. The past belonged behind her.She didn&#39;t want to cash in on an old name. What mattered now was building something real-something current.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still buzzing, Rena continued, &#34;There&#39;s a big business gala tomorrow at Cloudspire Center. My dad told me Victoria&#39;s on the guest list. Every major player from every industry is going to be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dark cloud settled over Hannah&#39;s face. She had never received an invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello? Hannah? Are you still there?&#34; Rena called out a few times before Hannah came back to the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah asked hesitantly, &#34;Hey, Rena... Is an invitation needed for that event?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement filled Rena&#39;s voice. &#34;Absolutely. I had a feeling you&#39;d want to go, so I have already asked my dad for extra invitations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added enthusiastically, &#34;With all those business heavyweights showing up, it&#39;s a perfect chance for you to get your face out there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, Rena. You&#39;re the best,&#34; Hannah replied, her smile genuine. Eight years had brought plenty of regret-marrying Vincent among them-but making friends with Rena had never been one of those mistakes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, Hannah searched online for information about the event. She learned that the  gala took place every two years, always centered on some headline-grabbing theme. For this year, all eyes were on the elusive and much-talked-about Victoria Hale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill swept over Hannah&#39;s face. Someone was out there using her old identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Hannah brushed on a bit of makeup and slipped into her go-to business suit before heading out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena swung by Sterling Heights to pick Hannah up and instantly frowned at the sight of her outfit.&#34;Hannah, come on. That look is way too plain for tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling into the back seat, Hannah finally noticed Rena&#39;s formal gown. Surprise flickered across her face. &#34;Hold on... Isn&#39;t this supposed to be a business event?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small sigh escaped Rena. &#34;It is, kind of. But it&#39;s also a fancy dinner,&#34; she explained, a note of frustration in her voice. &#34;You mean you really didn&#39;t know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, Hannah didn&#39;t. Vincent had never brought her along to one of these galas. She was completely out of the loop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I honestly had no idea,&#34; Hannah admitted. First time or not, she realized she needed to look the part. A glance at her watch told her there was still plenty of time before the event. An idea sparked right away.&#34;There&#39;s a boutique near Cloudspire Center. Want to help me pick out something more appropriate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bright smile spread across Rena&#39;s face. &#34;I&#39;d love to!&#34; She couldn&#39;t resist giving Hannah·a playful tap on the nose. &#34;You know how much I enjoy being your stylist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the boutique, the racks held plenty of nice dresses, but none of the sales assistants even bothered to greet them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah brushed off the indifference. She checked the time again, determined to choose something quickly and make it to the event on time. A handful of dresses caught her eye, and she started toward the fitting rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Rena stopped her in her tracks. &#34;The really high-end pieces are never left out front.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to call out a few times before a sales assistant finally appeared, looking anything but enthusiastic to help. &#34;Welcome. But just so you&#39;re aware, we don&#39;t permit anyone to try on dresses if they&#39;re wearing makeup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena pulled out her sleek VIP card, black and gold,and lifted her chin with confidence. &#34;Show us your priciest gowns.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, the sales assistant&#39;s demeanor shifted.Respect colored her words now. &#34;Absolutely.Which one of you will be doing the fittings?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A step forward put Hannah in front. &#34;I will,&#34; she replied. &#34;I&#39;m searching for something with an elegant touch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gesture led them forward. &#34;This way, ladies.You&#39;ll be able to browse our exclusive collection,&#34; the sales assistant assured, leading them toward the VIP lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet laugh slipped out as Rena glanced around.&#34;Let&#39;s hope the dresses aren&#39;t as tacky as the ones out front.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all,&#34; the sales assistant responded eagerly, a sweet smile fixed on her face. &#34;These pieces are the best we have. You&#39;ll be impressed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, they followed the sales assistant into the luxurious VIP lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the selection spoke for itself. Rena&#39;s gaze landed on one dress in particular-a mint green number that hugged the waist just right. Simple but refined, it was the sort of dress that showed off a lovely figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try this one, Hannah,&#34; Rena remarked, her eyes bright with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah gave a small, trusting smile. She never doubted Rena&#39;s taste. &#34;Okay, I&#39;lI give it a go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sales assistant quickly took the dress off the rack and handed it to Hannah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah was only a step from the fitting room when another customer came into view. A glance upward stopped her in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley walked out, a cluster of sales assistants following behind. She wore an extravagant white dress, and the headpiece she&#39;d chosen was so elaborate that it almost passed for a wedding veil.</p>
