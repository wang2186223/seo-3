                <p>Raymond shifted upright in the hospital bed,determination flashing in his eyes. &#34;No matter how busy Vincent claims to be, I am his father-in-law, and I deserve at least a visit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A meaningful glance passed between Raymond and Margaret,silent understanding hanging in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He added, &#34;Besides, you two have been married for five years, and we&#39;ve never even met your husband.That doesn&#39;t feel right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah met his gaze, sensing his resolve and knowing nothing she said could change his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to smooth things over, Margaret offered a gentle smile, &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Our daughter said Vincent would come. Let&#39;s trust her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Hannah replied, &#34;I&#39;ll call him right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping into the hallway, Hannah kept her phone pressed to her ear, hoping Vincent would finally answer. But call after call went unanswered, each one feeding her mounting anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, Hannah reached out to Derek for answers.&#34;Any idea where Vincent is right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Jones left the country on a business trip. Has something happened?&#34; Derek didn&#39;t need to ask-just by the sounds in the background, he could tell she was calling from a hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Avoiding the details, she kept her voice steady. &#34;Do you know when he&#39;ll return?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He didn&#39;t mention a specific date. Maybe try calling him directly?&#34; Derek suggested, treading carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With nothing left to say, Hannah murmured,&#34;Thanks,&#34; and ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resorting to Derek was a last resort. She hadn&#39;t wanted to bother him, but Vincent&#39;s silence left her no choice. She then sent Vincent a message. &#34;When are you coming back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after she hit send on the message, the urge to call vanished completely. Still, when she caught sight of her parents&#39; hopeful faces through the glass of the hospital room window, something in her refused to give up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relentlessly, she kept dialing his number, feeling the old ache she thought she&#39;d buried return with every unanswered ring. That familiar sting of waiting for Vincent, of being met with silence, dragged her back to the hardest</p>
