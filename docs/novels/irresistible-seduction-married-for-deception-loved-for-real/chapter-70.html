                <p>A flicker of surprise crossed Brinley&#39;s face when she spotted Hannah-what reason did Hannah have to be here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But curiosity quickly shifted. Brinley&#39;s gaze slid tothe woman beside Hannah, and it took only a heartbeat to recognize her as the same person who had disrupted that romantic dinner back in Calveria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley quickly pieced it together. Since Hannah knew that woman, she must be behind the disruption at the restaurant. The whole scene had probably been orchestrated by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That realization made Brinley&#39;s blood boil, and she shot Hannah and her friend a look that could freeze the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena was never one to stay silent. Her eyes narrowed at the sight of Brinley&#39;s gown, and her voice cut through the room. &#34;They&#39;re still legally married, and you&#39;re already trying on a wedding gown? You really don&#39;t waste any time, do you? Where&#39;s Vincent hiding-trying not to get caught?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All at once, the sales assistants stiffened, unsure if they should jump to serve their VIP client or just watch the fireworks. The way things looked, they might be witnessing a scandal unfold right before their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a word left Hannah&#39;s lips as she met Brinley&#39;s glare with a cold stare. She doubted Vincent was anywhere nearby-he never had the patience to sit around while someone tried on outfits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s eyes turned stormy. &#34;You should watch what you say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena retorted sharply, &#34;Oh, drop the act. Once a mistress, always a mistress. Even if Hannah signs the divorce papers, that won&#39;t change who you are. l&#39;d honestly love to see what Vincent has to say about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Rena strode over to a closed fitting room,not bothering to hide her contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley lifted the hem of her dress, trying to block her. &#34;Don&#39;t cause a scene!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sudden movement triggered the sales assistants, who all rushed forward to stop any potential chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glance at her phone reminded Hannah she had better things to do. She had no interest in arguing with Brinley and certainly didn&#39;t want to deal with Vincent. &#34;Just leave it, Rena. She isn&#39;t worth the trouble. We should just-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Hannah could finish, Rena swung open one of the doors, and there was Vincent. Inside, he lounged as if he owned the place, speaking smoothly while leading what was obviously a meeting with people from different countries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When someone barged in, he didn&#39;t even flinch-justlifted his eyes, calm and detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mocking laugh slipped out of Rena. &#34;Bravo, Mr.Jones. You&#39;ve really perfected the cheating husband routine-even hiding out in a fitting room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley darted over and tried to drag Rena back.&#34;You&#39;re disrupting his meeting. Leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger flared in Rena&#39;s eyes. &#34;Who in their right mind holds a meeting here? Hiding in a fitting room while your mistress gets fitted for a wedding dress? Real classy,Vincent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sales staff hovered nearby, torn between doing their jobs and watching the spectacle unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humiliated and angry, Brinley raised her hand, ready to slap Rena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That slap never happened-Hannah stepped forward,placing herself in front of Rena and catching Brinley&#39;s wrist mid-swing. Her words were as cold as steel.&#34;You think you can just hit people? I guess the word &#39;mistress&#39; stings a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go!&#34; Brinley exclaimed, her cheeks flushed with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah squeezed a little tighter before abruptly letting go, which sent Brinley stumbling backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley didn&#39;t hit the ground, though-Vincent was there in a heartbeat, steadying her before she could fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking every inch the polished CEO in his custom suit, Vincent and Brinley, in her sweeping white gown, almost looked picture-perfect. To anyone watching,they seemed made for each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s eyes were filled with icy annoyance when he met Hannah&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All Hannah could do was sneer. A romantic getaway abroad just days ago, and now he was back,wasting no time playing dress-up with his mistress. In five years of their marriage, she had never experienced even a fraction of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter smile crossed Hannah&#39;s lips as she met his  eyes head-on. &#34;Well, Mr. Jones, you seem to have plenty of time for wedding dress shopping with your mistress. Did you forget about one small thing-our divorce?&#34;</p>
