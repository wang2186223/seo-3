                <p>Holding back her frustration, Danica kept her voice steady. &#34;Ripping those divorce agreements up won&#39;t get you anywhere. Vincent never cared about you.Do you seriously want to stay married to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold confidence colored Hannah&#39;s words. &#34;That&#39;s right. Love doesn&#39;t mean much to me anyway. As long as the name Mrs. Jones holds some weight,that&#39;s all I&#39;m after.&#34; She paused and then continued in a lighter tone, &#34;And since I keep onto that title,there&#39;s no way I&#39;m hiding in some secret marriage.The second these divorce agreements are ripped apart, I&#39;ll announce to everyone that I&#39;m Vincent&#39;s rightful wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disdain twisted Danica&#39;s lips. &#34;Who on earth would buy that story? People will just see you as Vincent&#39;s mistress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good point,&#34; Hannah mused. &#34;Looks like I&#39;ll have to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ask Sharon to back me up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That shut Danica up for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Hannah lifted the divorce agreements, ready to tear them in half, panic surged in Danica&#39;s voice.&#34;Wait-hold on!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica didn&#39;t want Hannah to cling to the position as Vincent&#39;s wife. Hannah&#39;s background disgraced the entire Jones family. If their secret marriage ever got out, the Jones family&#39;s reputation would be destroyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Danica had to admit-Hannah was right on one thing. Keeping the Mrs. Jones title was worth more than any number of properties. It wasn&#39;t exactly a bad deal, trading those properties for Vincent&#39;s freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, parting with those ten properties was painful.Every single one had been carefully selected, from the neighborhood to the floor and the direction of the windows. Danica had poured so much energy into curating them. The thought of giving them all away in one go made her stomach twist. Yet, no matter how much it stung, Hannah had to divorce Vincent. That was the bigger issue. Those properties? She told herself she&#39;d find a way to reclaim them one day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind made up, Danica gave in. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll sign.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a tiny nod from Hannah, the attorney stepped forward and guided Danica through every contract.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the paperwork was finished. Hannah folded the divorce agreements neatly and slipped the signed property transfer contracts away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter edge sharpened Danica&#39;s final words. &#34;Don&#39;t you forget what you promised me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah replied, &#34;You don&#39;t need to worry. I&#39;m nothing like you. When I make a promise, I keep it.&#34;The decision to divorce Vincent was already set in stone. If Danica hadn&#39;t gone after her parents so harshly, things never would have come to this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with nothing else to discuss, Hannah gathered her things and went straight to work at Nova Tech. By the time her shift ended, she chose not to return to the Jones family home. Her car took her instead to Lakeshore Villa, where she threw out the things she didn&#39;t want, packed up what mattered, texted Sharon about not returning, and then set off for Sterling Heights. There was no sense pretending to be the loving wife when Vincent was overseas, busy with another woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorbarrow&#39;s city lights greeted Vincent and Brinley as their plane landed at eight in the evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doctors in Calveria had assured them that Brinley&#39;s health had improved. She only needed to avoid strong emotions and take her pills on time to prevent her heart condition from returning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley thought about hosting a celebration, but before she could make plans, Vincent&#39;s phone rang.Sharon&#39;s voice left no room for argument-she ordered him to come home right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the Jones estate, Sharon sat on the living room sofa, cane in hand and a look that would brook no nonsense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s eyes searched the space, but Hannah was nowhere to be found. A deep crease formed on his brow. It puzzled him-where else could Hannah be at this hour?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you do remember where home is?&#34; Sharon&#39;s cane hit the floor with a loud thump. &#34;Hannah&#39;s parents traveled all this way just to see you.l reminded you over and over again. And what did you do? You ignored them. Now look-Hannah was so upset that she didn&#39;t even come home tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A furious glare flashed in Sharon&#39;s eyes. Her grip tightened around her cane, and she lifted it, ready to strike Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley moved quickly, jumping in front of Vincent.&#34;Sharon, don&#39;t be angry with Vincent-he only missed dinner because of me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s hand came up, cutting her off before she could say another word. Tall and steady, he faced Sharon without so much as a flinch. His face stayed calm, but his tone softened just enough. &#34;You&#39;re right. I didn&#39;t handle this well. I&#39;ll speak with Hannah and explain everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want Sharon to get stressed about Brinley&#39;s heart condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the apology, Sharon&#39;s glare softened just a bit. &#34;Then go make things right with your wife tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent pressed his lips into a tight line and kept silent. Thinking about Hannah only gave him a headache. She seemed to have a shorter fuse than ever these days.</p>
