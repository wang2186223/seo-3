                <p>Derek hurried over, out of breath, his suit rumpled from the rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of Derek, a flash of surprise and tentative relief passed over Hannah&#39;s features.Maybe, just maybe, Vincent had arrived too. Her gaze darted past Derek, scanning for any sign of Vincent but finding none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But a single familiar silhouette lingered in the distance. A hopeful thought flickered in her mind.Perhaps Vincent was waiting in the car, sending Derek ahead as a scout. That thought gave her some hope-maybe her parents would still get to see him after all. She seized the moment to introduce Derek.&#34;Dad, Mom, this is Derek Barrett, Vincent&#39;s assistant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice to meet you.&#34; Raymond extended his hand with a genuine smile. He shared Hannah&#39;s mindset. The presence of an assistant suggested Vincent couldn&#39;t be far behind. Maybe the crowded station had simply delayed his arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Margaret remained quiet, her mind still spinning from the earlier confrontation at the estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek finally caught his breath and said politely,&#34;Mrs. Jones, Mr. and Mrs. Scott, could you come with me,please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No hesitation showed in Hannah&#39;s response. &#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A plan took root in her mind. If Vincent managed to salvage today and smoothed things over with her parents, she&#39;d let bygones be bygones and even try to avoid another fight with him for the rest of their days together,however few remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they made their way across the lot, the familiar lines of the Bentley caught Hannah&#39;s eye. Excitement surged as she hurried ahead and pulled open the back door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the seat inside was empty. Her hopeful expression vanished. Confusion and disappointment twisted inside her.Where was Vincent now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek&#39;s eyes flicked to Hannah, instantly picking up on her expectation that Vincent would be waiting in the car, ready to greet them. The disappointment etched on her face confirmed his suspicions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away from the empty seat, Hannah finally looked to Derek for answers. He offered a stiff,apologetic smile and then reached into the back for several gift bags. &#34;Mr. and Mrs. Scott, Mr. Jones wanted you to have these,&#34; he said, holding them out politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raymond didn&#39;t reach for the bags. His voice had gone cool. &#34;Is Vincent coming? Where is he now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carefully, Derek tried to explain, &#34;Mr. Jones got pulled into a last-minute merger negotiation. He couldn&#39;t break away. As soon as he realized he wouldn&#39;t make it in time, he asked me to deliver these gifts in his place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silent exchange passed between Raymond and Margaret. Both their faces showed only quiet disappointment, hearts aching for their daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swiping at the sweat on his borow, Derek tried to defuse the tension, wishing this part of his job didn&#39;t feel so thankless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah forced herself to stay composed. &#34;It&#39;s almost time, Mom, Dad. Let me walk you back to the train.&#34;Facing Derek, her tone was icy. &#34;We don&#39;t need the gifts. My parents have enough to carry as it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes held not a shred of warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek hesitated, trying again to offer the bags, but neither parent budged. Seeing no other option, he quietly returned everything to the trunk, not saying another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah dismissed Derek with a nod, then slipped an arm around her parents and led them to the train platform herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes before departure, Margaret pulled Hannah into a tight embrace. &#34;Hannah, if you&#39;re ever unhappy,just come home. We&#39;ll take care of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raymond didn&#39;t speak, but the firm pat on Hannah&#39;s shoulder said enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hot tears threatened to spill as Hannah nodded,her heart aching. Her parents had made the long journey out of concern, only to leave with deep worry for her.Self-blame and sorrow pressed down on her as she watched the train roll away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the platform was empty, she finally checked her phone. Right at the top sat a message from Brinley. &#34;You can stop waiting. Vincent won&#39;t be joining your family for lunch.&#34;</p>
