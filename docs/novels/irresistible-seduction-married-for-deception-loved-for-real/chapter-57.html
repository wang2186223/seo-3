                <p>A chill swept through Hannah as her father&#39;s reaction landed, dread coiling tightly inside her. &#34;Is something wrong?&#34; she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret started to reply, but Raymond silenced her with a stern hand. &#34;Let me handle this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing his daughter, his words shook with emotion,and he barely managed to keep in check. &#34;Answer me, Hannah. Is Vincent Jones truly your husband-the CEO everyone talks about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah immediately guessed what had happened.Someone must&#39;ve told her parents something-and it was most likely that secretary Clive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lobby grew busy around them, yet more and more people slowed their steps, drawn by the tension building in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to avoid an ugly public confrontation,Hannah tried to steady herself. &#34;We&#39;ll talk at home.Please, let&#39;s leave now, and I&#39;ll explain everything there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Raymond wouldn&#39;t budge. &#34;We&#39;re not going anywhere. You answer me right now. Are you working a real job, or have you really been living off a man all this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That word hit like a slap. Hannah instinctively shook her head. &#34;No, that&#39;s not true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then start explaining,&#34; he urged, his finger trembling as he pointed at her. &#34;Tell me the truth.Is your marriage even real? Why does no one acknowledge you as Vincent Jones&#39;s wife? Why is everyone saying you&#39;re just his mistress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fixed her with an unyielding stare, desperate for answers. But Hannah looked away, unable to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in his raised voice only escalated. &#34;Don&#39;t just stand there. Say something! I want the truth!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A circle of onlookers had formed, their whispers and camera phones quietly recording the unfolding family drama. Hannah refused to utter a word in front of strangers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raymond mistook her silence for shame. His expression collapsed into heartbreak. Their daughter... She had truly ended up living as another man&#39;s kept woman. Pain was clear in his eyes, and he backed away. &#34;Get out of my sight. You&#39;re not the daughter | thought I raised. The Hannah I know wouldn&#39;t trade her dignity for a life like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breathing turned ragged, each breath rougher than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah opened her mouth, trying to steer the conversation elsewhere-to stop this downward spiral-but the moment she lifted her head, she saw her father struggling for breath, his face drained of color. &#34;Dad! Dad, what&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret jumped in quickly, cradling her husband  and rubbing his back. &#34;Hannah, his blood pressure&#39;s spiking. We need to get him to the hospital,now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shaky &#34;Alright&#34; was all Hannah could manage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lobby&#39;s curious eyes, their murmurs, and the flashes from phones faded as Hannah hurried her parents outside, her gaze cold and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of the trio spoke during the ride. Silence pressed in on all sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long,Raymond was admitted to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streaked down Margaret&#39;s cheeks as she tried to find her voice. &#34;Maybe we never should have come, Hannah. This only made things worse for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting close, Hannah reached for a tissue and gently dabbed her mother&#39;s face, whispering, &#34;Mom,please. Dad&#39;s going to pull through. You have to trust that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grief made Margaret&#39;s voice quiver as she looked up,her eyes red and swollen. &#34;Hannah, have things been hard for you all these years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fingers gripping her daughter&#39;s hand for support,Margaret pleaded, &#34;Come back with us. Life might be quieter, but at least you&#39;ll have your dignity. I can&#39;t bear to see you living like this.&#34; Always, their daughter had stood tall and proud. The thought of her being anyone&#39;s mistress was almost too much for them to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dull ache filled Hannah&#39;s chest as she watched her mother struggle to hold herself together. Worry had driven her parents all this way, hoping for reassurance and a glimpse of happiness in her life.All they had wanted was to meet Vincent and see her contented finally. Instead, they&#39;d been met with doubt and humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Happiness for their only child had always been their greatest wish. Facing a truth so painful seemed impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blinking back her own tears, Hannah squeezed Margaret&#39;s shoulder, trying to sound light even though her heart was heavy. &#34;Mom, I&#39;m not someone&#39;s plaything. Vincent and I are actually married. It&#39;s just that we kept the marriage under wraps. You know how these wealthy families are-it&#39;s all about appearances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hopeful look flickered in Margaret&#39;s eyes. &#34;Is that true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to prove herself, Hannah decided to call Vincent again. &#34;You don&#39;t have to worry, Mom. Dad&#39;s here in the hospital, and I know Vincent will come as soon as he can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In reality, Hannah had once planned to tell her parents she and Vincent were getting a divorce. But circumstances had changed, and the truth would only cause more pain now. Right now, she needed to put their minds at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once her father was stable and out of emergency care, a measure of relief settled over Hannah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking her seat at his bedside, she leaned in and explained quietly, &#34;Dad, I really am married to Vincent. We just never made it public, which is why there are so many rumors. But you have my word, it&#39;s real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicion lingered in Raymond&#39;s eyes as he turned toward his wife. &#34;You believe her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret nodded with quiet conviction.&#34;Ido.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Raymond looked skeptical. &#34;Don&#39;t try to lie to me just because I&#39;m not well. I can handle the truth,no matter what it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah shook her head. &#34;I&#39;m telling you the truth.Vincent and I are legally married.&#34; She paused, willing herself to stay strong. &#34;If you want, I&#39;ll even bring the marriage license for you to see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A skeptical look remained on Raymond&#39;s face. &#34;If what you&#39;re saying is true, bring Vincent here. I want to hear it from him myself.&#34;</p>
