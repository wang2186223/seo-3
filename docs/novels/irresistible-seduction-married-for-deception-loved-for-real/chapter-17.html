                <p>Over The Edge</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Vincent and Brinley headed out for the hospital, Danica marched straight over to Hannah,her anger barely contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You actually wanted Brinley gone, didn&#39;t you?&#34;Danica questioned, shoving her finger closeto Hannah&#39;s face. &#34;I can&#39;t believe it took me this long to see just how cruel you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah didn&#39;t bother to offer any defense. &#34;That figures. People from your family never bother to think before acting or throwing accusations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her back, Hannah made her way upstairs to get her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s attention was finally drawn to the steady stream of blood running down Hannah&#39;s right hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your hand is bleeding that badly, and you&#39;re just going to ignore it? You really think pulling a stunt like this will make Vincent care about you more?&#34; Danica yelled up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no reply from Hannah. She climbed each step slowly, as if she couldn&#39;t hear a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her vision was a little hazy as the earlier scene replayed in her mind. Vincent brought every single word Brinley had uttered without a hint of doubt while dismissing her explanation outright. They had been together for five years as husband and wife.Yet, that still meant nothing compared to a single tear from his first love. What was the point of everything she&#39;d done over the years? All of it just felt like a cruel joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah pulled out her phone and called Rena, asking her for a ride to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, on the journey to the hospital, Vincent sat up front beside the driver. Brinley was seated in the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep frown stayed etched on Vincent&#39;s face, and the tension refused to leave his brow. Hannah&#39;s stubborn face kept flashing through his mind,refusing to fade. He spoke in a clipped tone to Derek.&#34;Take us to the hospital. After that, go back and get Hannah. Make sure she&#39;s treated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; Derek replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s gaze darted toward Vincent as she leaned a bit closer. &#34;Vincent, I&#39;m sure Hannah is alright. Try not to worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hope so,&#34; he replied curtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley wanted to say more, but Vincent clearly wasn&#39;t in the mood for conversation. He answered her enthusiasm with short, blunt replies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once at the hospital, Brinley&#39;s tests showed no alarming issues. The only concern was the cuts on her hand from the shattered glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While her hand was being treated, she kept trying to lean into Vincent for comfort, but he always managed to shift away from her touch. After a while, he made an excuse to leave and walked out into the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent stood alone in the hallway, still piecing his thoughts together, when his phone buzzed. Derek was calling. &#34;Mr. Jones, Miss Brown has already taken your wife to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Vincent replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually...&#34; Derek hesitated, unsure whether to speak up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s reply was cold. &#34;Is there something else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw blood all over the staircase, and it seems to be your wife&#39;s,&#34; Derek finally said, hesitating no more.Even though Brinley seemed to be the one Vincent favored these days, he still believed Vincent couldn&#39;t just turn his back on his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tightness formed in Vincent&#39;s throat. &#34;Do you know which hospital she&#39;s in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;P&#39;Il check right-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,someone rushed past Vincent. He glanced up and saw it was Rena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need.&#34; Vincent ended the call and quickly caught up to Rena. &#34;Tell me where Hannah is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena spun around to face him, her anger flaring instantly. &#34;You have some nerve showing concern now. I should be the one demanding answers-what exactly did you do to Hannah?&#34; Her words came out shaky with rage. &#34;Vincent, you made a promise to look after Hannah. And nowN look at her. You almost pushed her over the edge!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, once rushing over to the Jones family estate,Rena had been greeted by the sight of Hannah slumping near the gates. There was no life in Hannah&#39;s eyes, and her face had turned ashen,as if the world had broken her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Rena, Hannah had looked like she was hanging on by a thread. However, even in that state, Hannah had forced a faint smile and insisted she was alright. But how could she possibly be fine?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away, Rena made it clear she did not want to say another word to Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s expression grew grim. &#34;What do you mean by that? Where is she right now?&#34;</p>
