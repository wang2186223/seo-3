                <p>With a quiet tenderness, Sharon brushed a stray lock of hair behind Hannah&#39;s ear, ignoring Brinley&#39;s attempt to steal her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Vincent told the housekeeper, &#34;Aubrey, please help Grandma upstairs so she can get some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon, however,planted her feet, defiance in her eyes. &#34;You&#39;re trying to get rid of me because you really did do something to hurt Hannah, didn&#39;t you? Tonight, I&#39;m staying put to make sure she gets the justice she deserves.&#34; A gentle cough punctuated her stubbornness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concern flashed across Hannah&#39;s face as she patted Sharon&#39;s back. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about me. I&#39;ll be alright,really. Just go rest for a bit, please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon&#39;s health was fragile. Hannah couldn&#39;t bear the thought of her being dragged into another stressful scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lies. Don&#39;t bother trying to send me away,&#34; Sharon insisted, her voice strained and her breath unsteady.&#34;I won&#39;t leave you alone-not when someone here might mistreat you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of watching Hannah try to keep the peace with Danica had left a mark on Sharon. Even when Danica hurled the most awful words at Hannah, Hannah had never shown anything but a polite smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Danica&#39;s anger bubbled over. &#34;This is all your fault, Hannah. Look how upset you&#39;ve made Sharon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring the accusation, Hannah turned to Aubrey. &#34;Please, just see that Sharon gets comfortable upstairs.&#34;Looking Sharon in the eye, she added softly,&#34;1anything happens to you because of me, I&#39;d never forgive myself. I promise, if I need help, I&#39;ll come straight to you. I&#39;m right here. You&#39;ll hear if something&#39;s wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey chimed in, &#34;She&#39;s right. Please trust that she can handle the situation. And Mr. Jones is here. He won&#39;t let her be mistreated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon huffed, &#34;Vincent is the one who&#39;s made things so difficult for Hannah.&#34; A finger pointed squarely at Vincent, her tone cutting. &#34;Hannah is your wife. Don&#39;t you dare keep hurting her to please anyone else. Do you hear me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s face fell. She caught onto the insinuation immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent murmured, &#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle squeeze of Hannah&#39;s hand served as Sharon&#39;s goodbye, and finally, she allowed herself to be led upstairs. She knew that if she stayed and her health failed, it would only worry Hannah. Deep down, she recognized her limits-she couldn&#39;t shield Hannah forever. Marriage, after all, was something Hannah and Vincent needed to navigate together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had Sharon left the room than Danica pounced, voice sharp. &#34;Hannah, you honestly think Sharon&#39;s support is enough to sweep this under the rug? Get real. It won&#39;t. You owe Brinley an apology.&#34; She was sure Hannah was behind the video leak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah hadn&#39;t bothered glancing at the video. Her words were icy. &#34;I have nothing to do with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only you had that video, Hannah. Who else could have leaked it?&#34; Shrill and shaking, Brinley clung to Vincent&#39;s hand, tears streaking down her face.&#34;V/incent, now the world&#39;s seen me...Seen me harassed by two men. How am I supposed to live with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica, all sympathy and outrage, dabbed away Brinley&#39;s tears.&#34;Don&#39;t you worry, sweetheart. We&#39;ll make sure Hannah pays for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A steely calm settled over Hannah. &#34;Then show your evidence. If you&#39;re making accusations, at least present proof to me. Or is this how things are done now, shouting blame without a shred of evidence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That dismissive attitude sent Danica into a rage. &#34;The only person with that video was you! Unless you&#39;re suggesting Brinley leaked that damn video herself? I know what&#39;s really going on: you&#39;re jealous that Vincent cares for her. You snapped and wanted payback. The Jones family shouldn&#39;t have let you marry in!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter, cold and humorless, escaped Hannah. &#34;Bring me proof, or stop talking. Who gave you the right...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t get to finish. Vincent cut her off, his voice low and glacial. &#34;Apologize.&#34;</p>
