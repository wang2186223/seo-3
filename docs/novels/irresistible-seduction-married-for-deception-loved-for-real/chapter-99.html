                <p>No explanation left Hannah&#39;s lips-just a soft &#34;thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Hannah reached out for the suit from the sales assistant, Felix quietly stepped in to take it for her.Not once did he bother to set the record straight about being her boyfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief glance passed between them, their understanding wordless and effortless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s eyes darted from Hannah and Felix to Vincent,noting the storm gathering on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s jaw clenched, and his gaze grew sharp and frigid, his attention locked on Hannah. &#34;Wow.Upgraded to acknowledge him as your boyfriend already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent was really livid. Only days ago, they&#39;d been fighting, yet Hannah had already paraded around with the statement that she was with someone else.He saw through it-she wanted a reaction from him,and she knew exactly how to get under his skin. Felix was just the pawn for her little performance. Still,their closeness made a muscle jump at his temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s reply was calm, her tone cold. &#34;Don&#39;t you already have chosen another woman to remarry Soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t fathom his audacity in throwing accusations her way. Wedding dresses, renovations,this little shopping excursion-did he just make preparations for his big day with Brinley this time?Not that it mattered to her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s gaze flicked briefly to Brinley before she turned back to Vincent, her voice cool and dismissive. &#34;If you&#39;re both finished, please move.We&#39;re busy here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, her focus went back to the suits, while Felix continued watching her intently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A humorless laugh escaped Vincent. Was she really telling him he was in her way? Unbelievable. A single step brought him closer as he reached out, aiming to seize HHannah&#39;s wrist. &#34;You&#39;re coming with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With reflexes sharpened by experience, Hannah slipped neatly behind Felix, dodging Vincent&#39;s grasp before he could touch her. Vincent&#39;s hand met nothing but empty air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her instinctive retreat deepened the shadows on Vincent&#39;s face. &#34;Come here,&#34; he said, his words taut and icy enough to send a chill through the store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;I&#39;m staying right where | am.This time, you don&#39;t get to force me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to let herself be humiliated again. That</p>
