                <p>Stepping down from the third floor, Brinley paused mid-step as Vincent&#39;s voice drifted from the hall,deep in conversation with his assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reacting instantly, she ducked behind a column and stayed out of sight, her ears straining to catch every word.Every detail of Vincent&#39;s exchange with Derek filtered through, reaching her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley allowed herself a smug smile. Cautious planning had paid off. The moment she discovered Hannah was investigating her, she&#39;d made sure to payoff the two men who&#39;d fled back to their hometown, coaching them to play along to fool Hannah&#39;s detective, only to change their story when giving their statements in the police station. A bundle of cash had easily bought their cooperation. Yet, Vincent&#39;s unexpected investigation sent a jolt of unease through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With quiet urgency, Brinley slipped back to her room, phone already in hand as she speed-dialed her favorite gossip reporter.&#34;Do it now. Release everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, she called the police next. &#34;I want to report a crime. Someone hired men to assault me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By eight that night, the hashtag # CEO of Jones Group&#39;s First Love Harassed exploded across every social platform. Though the face in the video was blurry, anyone familiar with Brinley recognized her at a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To summon the right tears, Brinley pinched her thigh until her eyes watered. The moment Vincent walked through the door, she rushed downstairs, cryingon cue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Hannah sat with Sharon in the living room, lost in quiet conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley burst in, voice trembling. &#34;Hannah, do you hate me that much?&#34; She made a beeline for Hannah and latched onto Hannah&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick jerk freed Hannah&#39;s hand. Folding her arms, she met Brinley&#39;s accusation head-on. &#34;Yes, I can&#39;t stand you. I don&#39;t have the energy to pretend otherwise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley raised her volume, tears streaming. &#34;So you&#39;re admitting it, then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion clouded Hannah&#39;s face as her brow furrowed. &#34;Admitting to what?&#34; Every instinct screamed this was another setup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commotion drew Danica over, her concern painted in worried lines. &#34;Brinley, what happened? Why are you in tears?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever it is, sit down and sort this out like civilized people.&#34; Sharon rapped her cane against the floor,her voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep crease furrowed Vincent&#39;s brow as he took in the tense exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone else could speak, Brinley jumped in, voice trembling. &#34;Sharon, I swear, causing drama was never my intention. It&#39;s just that Hannah can&#39;t stand me and even went out of her way to plot against me.Here,look for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears hidden behind one hand, Brinley showed her phone screen for the gathered crowd to see, the headline blaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica took one glance and went rigid. That was the exact same footage she&#39;d glimpsed earlier on Hannah&#39;s phone. Eyes narrowed, she swung her glare to Hannah. &#34;Did you leak the video to the press?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon, struggling to catch the thread of accusations, turned to Vincent for answers. &#34;What video are they talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eager to deliver proof, Danica started to hand the phone over, but Hannah moved faster, snatching it from her grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That move made Danica erupt. &#34;What&#39;s your problem, Hannah?&#34; Realization dawned a second later.&#34;1see what this is. You&#39;re scared. You don&#39;t want Sharon to see what kind of person you really are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of satisfaction danced in Brinley&#39;s eyes. With Danica fueling the conflict, she could simply stand back-her tears would do the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharp words from Danica soured Sharon&#39;s expression. Sharon snapped,&#34;That&#39;s enough, Danica. How could you accuse Hannah like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to back down, Danica tried to push the issue. &#34;Sharon, you don&#39;t know the half of it...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single icy look from Vincent silenced her instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah kept her focus on Sharon, her tone gentle and steady. &#34;Please, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll handle this myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sadness flashed across Sharon&#39;s face as she reached for Hannah&#39;s hand. &#34;Tell me what&#39;s wrong,sweetheart. There&#39;s nothing to be afraid of. I&#39;ll help you-did Vincent hurt you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah had married into the Jones family but was never publicly acknowledged due to her secret marriage to Vincent. Over the years, she had endured far too much. Sharon&#39;s heart ached for Hannah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s vision blurred for a moment, touched by Sharon&#39;s concern. She had no intention of dragging Sharon into family squabbles, and she was just about to suggest Sharon go rest, when Brinley interjected with a trembling voice,it because I&#39;m an outsider that you put your trust only in Hannah?&#34; Tears shimmered in her eyes.</p>
