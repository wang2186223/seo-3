                <p>A heavy silence settled between Vincent and Hannah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent walked over to the door and said, &#34;Get some rest.&#34; He eased the door shut behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s hands curled into fists, anger simmering beneath the surface. She doubted Vincent truly felt nothing for her. Hannah could only ever be a substitute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Brinley sat and stewed in her thoughts, determination slowly set in. She would find a way to win Vincent back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurrled through her shower, dabbed perfume on her neck and wrists, and wrapped herself in a pale pink towel before heading for Vincent&#39;s bedroom on the lower floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brinley entered the room, the sound of water told her Vincent was still in the bathroom. Not long after,he emerged, bare-chested, with damp hair and beads of water gliding down his abs. The moment he caught sight of her, he stopped in his tracks. A deep frown creased his face. He reached for a T-shirt and pulled it on without saying anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need something?&#34; he asked flatly, fastening his watch. There was just enough time to pick Hannah up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vincent,&#34; Brinley said in a gentle voice, moving a little closer, &#34;I still love you. Can&#39;t we start over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyebrows drew together. &#34;I don&#39;t feel the same. I thought I already told you that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She faltered. Clearly, he still held a grudge over her decision to leave him for another country five years ago.She closed the gap between them without another word, rising onto her toes and pressing her lips to his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent wasted no time.He stepped away at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right at that moment, a knock sounded at the door. A chilly voice came from the hallway.&#34;1f.you two want to have sex, maybe you should pick another room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing in the hallway was Hannah. She had originally planned to speak with Vincent&#39;s grandmother about the upcoming birthday banquet, but seeing how late it had gotten, she chose not to interrupt. Nothing could have prepared her for what greeted her when she stepped into her room. Even after convincing herself she had grown numb, the scene still managed to pierce her heart. After a brief pause, she gathered her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Brinley, caught off guard by Vincent&#39;s sudden movement, stumbled straight into his arms. He wasted no time in pushing her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman wrapped in only a towel. A man, still dripping from his shower.Anyone would find the situation suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah decided not to ask for an explanation. &#34;There are plenty of empty rooms upstairs on the third floor.You can use whichever you like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent stepped closer and tried to clarify. &#34;She lost her balance. I just caught her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; Hannah replied blandly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching her towel tightly, Brinley stepped forwardd, eyes wide as she put on an innocent act. &#34;Hannah,please don&#39;t misunderstand. Vincent and I didn&#39;t do anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were meant for Vincent, of course-so he&#39;d see how understanding she was. A sly smile flickered across her face, a silent challenge thrown in Hannah&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole situation invited all kinds of assumptions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah simply turned her head away. She clearly had no intention to engage in this conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley didn&#39;t linger. Vincent&#39;s refusal stung, but she would never let it show. Keeping her composure, she quietly thanked him for his help that night and started walking upstairs. There was no rush. Time was on her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, back in the room, an uncomfortable silence settled between Vincent and Hannah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent opened his mouth to speak more than once, but Hannah barely responded, her gaze distant,her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after a long stretch of quiet did Hannah finally say something, her words rough around the edges.&#34;Vincent, I&#39;ve already tolerated those antics. But can you...&#34; She paused, searching for the right words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uneasy pressure weighed on his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you not do it with Brinley here?&#34; Her eyes dropped to the floor, and her voice sounded calm,far too calm. &#34;I only ask that you don&#39;t make out with her in this room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories flashed through Hannah&#39;s mind. They had lived here for over half a year after getting married.it was, in every sense, their shared bedroom-theirfirst true home together. Side by side, they had chosen every piece of furniture, every color, every detail. Every corner held pieces of their shared past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had replaced the original mattress because she&#39;d complained it was too hard. He&#39;d gone out of his way to find a softer one. She still remembered that night-he had made love to her not once,but three times just to be sure she liked it. A crib had even appeared beside their bed, bought in hopeful anticipation. But now,that little crib sat forgotten in the farthest corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During their stay in this place, even though Danica had often made things difficult for Hannah,Vincent had returned home each night and joined Hannah and his grandmother at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, their days had felt calm, even ordinary, but for Hannah, that peace had been the truest happiness she had ever known. In those moments, when her love for him was at its peak, every night in this room had left behind a trace of passion and intimacy. Now, she didn&#39;t want those precious memories to be tainted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent looked up at her, feeling a chill growing inside. His voice came out in a low, aching tone. &#34;Is that how you see me?&#34;</p>
