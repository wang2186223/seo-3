                <p>Hannah lounged in the private room, drinking one colorful cocktail after another. Every glass tasted sweet and packed a punch, and soon a pink flush colored her cheeks, her eyes hazy with drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the male escorts around her, each one young, striking, and sculpted to perfection. Yet,even in the middle of all that attention, a dull sadness weighed her down. She felt the urge to cry because no matter how much she drank, her thoughts kept drifting backto that bastard husband of hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah lifted her wrist and flashed the diamond bracelet. &#34;Whoever can make me the happiest tonight gets this,&#34; she remarked, her voice smooth and low. &#34;It&#39;s worth a hundred grand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a gift from Vincent-something she used to treasure. But not anymore. She wanted neither thebracelet nor the man who gave it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The escorts wasted no time. One started grinding up behind her, moving in rhythm with the music.Another leaned close, whispering sweet nothings in her ear.A third flexed his abs and chest as if showing off at a fitness competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, one of them, a little bolder than the rest,bent in close and murmured, &#34;My tongue game&#39;s next-level.Wanna try?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah let out a languid smile. &#34;Why not?&#34; This guy was cute-puppy-eyed, gentle. Nothing like Vincent,whose sharp features and cold gaze always made him seem unapproachable. She&#39;d been with Vincent long enough. Maybe it was time for a change of taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unclasping the bracelet, Hannah handed it over without hesitation. &#34;Take it. It&#39;s yours now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the guy leaned in for a kiss, Hannah matched his move with a grin. But before their lips could touch,a strong arm shot out, dragging her back against a  familiar chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent hit her instantly. Clean, cool, unmistakably him. She didn&#39;t even need to look up. She knew who it was.&#34;Let go of me,&#34; she murmured, her voice thick with liquor and stubborn pride. &#34;I haven&#39;t even had the chance to kiss him yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent held her tighter, not letting go. &#34;Enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around, the escorts froze in confusion and annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who the hell are you?&#34; one of them questioned.&#34;You can&#39;t just take our client away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s expression clouded over. &#34;Leave,&#34; he instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of his voice left no room for argument.Every escort hurried to collect their things and scrambled to the door without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still holding Hannah close, Vincent caught sight of the bracelet-now in the hand of one of the retreating escorts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,&#34; Vincent snapped. &#34;Hand over the bracelet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy stopped, glancing down at the jewelry. &#34;But she gave it to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent stared him down, completely unconvinced.He remembered that bracelet. Hannah cherished it like it was priceless. There was no chance she&#39;d give it away if she were sober. This guy must have coaxed it out of her, taking advantage of her drunkenness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give it back,&#34; Vincent said, his voice low and threatening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without further protest, the guy surrendered the bracelet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still tipsy, Hannah reached for the guy. &#34;Don&#39;t leave yet,&#34; she called out, her voice dreamy. &#34;Didn&#39;t you say your tongue was amazing? I haven&#39;t tested it yet...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah squirmed in Vincent&#39;s hold, pouting and whining, until he kissed her firmly. The fight left her in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, once back home, Vincent pressed her gently against the door. Her hair tumbled in every direction,her gaze unfocused, and a bright flush colored her cheeks from the alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent quietly slipped the bracelet back onto her wrist. &#34;Wear it. I&#39;ll be around more often from now on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little laugh escaped her. So that was what he thought? That she was throwing a tantrum because he hadn&#39;t been home enough?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to wriggle away, but he pulled her close again. She bristled in his arms, tense and ready to snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent moved in slowly, his lips almost touching hers. That was when she caught the scent clinging to him. Another woman&#39;s perfume. Fury flashed through her as she shoved him back and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. &#34;Don&#39;t touch me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of revulsion swept through her, and she darted into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent was right behind her, barely a step away. He held her hair back as she bent over the sink, his palm resting gently on her back. &#34;Is it really that bad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, his phone vibrated. She managed to see the name on the screen-Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped away to take the call. A moment passed before he returned, reached for his jacket, and said,&#34;Work called.I have to head out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Work? Hannah walked out of the bathroom, her eyes flickering toward the clock. The display read three a.m. Who would be calling about business in the middle of the night? It could only mean one thing.He must be leaving to meet his first love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah sobered up instantly. &#34;Hold on. Your mother needs your signature on these papers.&#34; She rummaged through a drawer, pulled out a few documents, and passed them to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent barely glanced at the pages as he scribbled   his name. He then walked out the door without looking back. Had he paid more attention, he would have realized the last document was a divorce agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley had called about a supposed sudden pain in her stomach, and Vincent had wasted no time driving her to the hospital, where he stayed until the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Vincent finally returned home, Hannah was still fast asleep, curled up in last night&#39;s clothes. He changed her into her pajamas, prepared a glass of lemon water, and placed it on the dining table before leaving quietly for work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours passed, and Hannah woke up with a throbbing headache, feeling completely drained. She noted a text from Vincent on her phone.&#34;Are you feeling any better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided not to reply. Walking out of her room she spotted a glass of lemon water waiting for her on the dining table. &#34;Thank you, Aubrey,&#34; she said to the housekeeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aubrey Palmer, the housekeeper, returned her gratitude with a smile. &#34;Mrs. Jones, I think it was Mr.Jones who prepared this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah lowered her eyes. Thoughtfulness had always come naturally to Vincent, both when they were just dating and after they got married. Yet now,that kindness felt empty. He was gentle with her, not out of love, but because her face bore a resemblance to Brinley&#39;s. Brinley was the one he truly loved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah took a few careful sips. &#34;Please take this away,&#34; she said to Aubrey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then reached for the divorce agreement and made a call to Danica. &#34;You can get started on transferring the properties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of excitement came through in Danica&#39;s voice. &#34;So he signed it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, he did.&#34; Hannah paused for a moment. &#34;Let&#39;s hold off for a month before we tell everyone else in the family about the divorce. I&#39;ll move out after that.&#34;ight Her reason for waiting was simple. Sharon Jones,Vincent&#39;s grandmother, was about to turn seventy.Touched by Sharon&#39;s consistent kindness toward her,she couldn&#39;t bring herself to soil Sharon&#39;s mood by breaking out the divorce news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call ended, &#34;Nova Tech Rumored to Be Facing Bankruptcy&#34; appeared on her phone news feed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nova Tech was the company Hannah had founded back in college. It had made a name for itself nationwide, specializing in women&#39;s safety products.But after getting married, she&#39;d left behind her business, her dreams, and her entire future. She had lost herself completely in love, and Vincent had taken over her whole world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s stomach dropped as she read the headline.Pondering for a while, she eventually got dressed to meet her old business partner, Felix Wade.</p>
