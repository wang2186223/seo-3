                <p>A thick folder labeled &#34;Nova Tech Acquisition Plan&#34; landed on the table as Brinley set it before Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent met her eyes, curiosity piqued. &#34;You want to acquire this company?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right.&#34; Without hesitation, Brinley shared her reasoning. &#34;Nova Tech and Polaris Tech have always been rivals, but Nova&#39;s product line is far more developed. If we move fast and bring their assets under our umbrella, it gives Polaris Tech a real edge and could help us lock in future deals with VitraMind. Moreover,Nova Tech recently declared bankruptcy, presenting a timely opportunity for acquisition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still feeling the sting from Hannah&#39;s public humiliation at the gala, Brinley was eager to prove her capabilities and solidify her persona as &#34;Victoria&#34; to silence the doubters for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acquiring another company and taking over their products was the quickest way Brinley could think of.It wasn&#39;t just about their products.Nova Tech had once hit the big time. Acquiring it meant she could parade its past success as her own achievement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was one snag-Brinley didn&#39;t have enough funds to make the acquisition, which was why she brought her pitch to Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of anxiety crept into Brinley&#39;s voice. &#34;Vincent, what do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent considered her proposal, eyebrows lifted in mild surprise. &#34;That&#39;s a bold plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spent a moment leafing through the acquisition documents before finally responding,&#34;It&#39;s worth a try.&#34;Excitement lit up Brinley&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleepless night weighed heavily on Hannah, who reached Nova Tech before anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yesterday&#39;s encounter with Miles at the gala had only fueled her determination to prove what Nova Tech could really do. The priority was to produce the hormone detection wristband after wrapping up its design.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena revealed that in a few days, there would be an open bidding opportunity for VitraMind. If Miles took a liking to their product, securing a partnership would be a sure thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix noticed the dark circles beneath Hannah&#39;s eyes, along with her relentless energy as she dove straight into work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When lunchtime rolled around, fretting she might skip the meal altogether, Felix dragged her to his office to dine together. Yet, even throughout the meal, she kept the conversation focused on product features and improvements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix&#39;s office had a small lounge with a bed meant for resting. Worried about her burning out, he suggested,&#34;After lunch, you should lie down and recharge-it&#39;s lunch break, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah said, &#34;I&#39;m not tired. I want to update the wristband&#39;s algorithm after the meal.&#34; But after only a few bites, she set her fork down, her appetite lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she tried to slip out of his office, he gently nudged her toward the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just rest a bit, okay?&#34; With a wry smile, Felix joked, &#34;I need you in one piece for the launch of our new product.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft laugh escaped Hannah.&#34;I&#39;m tougher than I look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix shook his head. &#34;That&#39;s not true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still remembered that back when Hannah hadn&#39;t married and was still hidden behind the alias&#34;Victoria,&#34;she had fallen ill after facing online backlash for her initiatives as &#34;Victoria.&#34; Her old college roommates had shared that detail with him during one of his visits to her campus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the genuine concern in his voice, Hannah felt her cheeks warm with embarrassment. She didn&#39;t resist and straightforwardly said, &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll rest for a while. Just wake me up when it&#39;s time to get back to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a nod, Felix eased the door shut behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his desk, he found himself distracted by thoughts of her resting just a few steps away. Something about sharing this space with her felt different, more meaningful-maybe it because she held a special place in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time slipped by. By the time the clock hit three, Felix still hadn&#39;t stirred Hannah from her nap. He secretly hoped she&#39;d sleep even longer, knowing how much she needed some rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, the receptionist rushed in. &#34;Mr. Wade, someone from Polaris Tech wants to meet with you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix quickly put a finger to his lips. &#34;Quiet, please.&#34; Leaning in, he whispered urgently, &#34;Polaris Tech? Tell them I&#39;m not available. I don&#39;t know who they are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a voice spoke up from behind the receptionist. &#34;You must be Mr. Wade.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three visitors entered-two men flanking a poised woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley, linking arms with Vincent, offered a bright smile. &#34;We&#39;re here to discuss a potential partnership, Mr.Wade.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clive stepped forward and extended the business proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix, however, didn&#39;t reach for it, instead locking eyes with Vincent in silent acknowledgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the tension, Clive awkwardly withdrew the proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cool,assessing glance came from Vincent. &#34;Your operation here is on the small side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Felix responded evenly, &#34;Naturally, our company can&#39;t compare to yours, Mr. Jones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of surprise crossed Brinley&#39;s face-did these two know each other?</p>
