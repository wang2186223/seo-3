                <p>Hannah&#39;s polite smile faltered for a second. Conflicting feelings surged-hurt, annoyance, and the sharp sting of being wrongly judged. What exactly did Miles mean by &#34;someone like you?&#34; The words echoed,heavier than she&#39;d expected. Never had she imagined the man she&#39;d met only twice would have already slapped a label on her, making sweeping assumptions about her character.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite that sting, Hannah straightened and smoothed her expression. She spoke with poise. &#34;Perhaps there&#39;s been a misunderstanding-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Miles refused to hear her out. Without so much as a glance, he strode away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah gathered up her dress and picked up the pace to catch up. She moved in front of him, walking backward to match his pace. &#34;Listen, Mr. Whitaker, mny abilities match Brinley&#39;s, if not exceed them. Give Nova Tech one shot-I&#39;ll even sweeten the deal. Take five percent off, plus an even split on the profits. You won&#39;t regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, mirthless laugh escaped Miles as he halted. His eyes glinted with equal parts amusement and challenge. &#34;That&#39;s gutsy. Tell me, do you realize what five percent actually means in a deal like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Numbers and bottom lines weren&#39;t lost on Hannah. Granting such a discount would eat into Nova Tech&#39;s margins, barely leaving enough after development and production. Still, she held his gaze without flinching.She answered with resolve, &#34;Five percent represents commitment. The real question is-are you open to seeing what we can do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about her fierce confidence gave Miles pause. For a brief moment, he hesitated. But his silence stretched,and without a word, he sidestepped her, vanishing into the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Miles settled into his Porsche and addressed Kenneth without turning his head, &#34;Find out everything about Nova Tech.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood. Is this for a new partnership?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Miles answered, his voice cold enough to freeze steel. He just wanted to know what kind of company dared to offer him terms like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Derek gripped the steering wheel, pressing harder on the gas as sweat trickled down his temple.Every nerve was on edge. His boss looked ready to explode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the backseat, Vincent ripped his tie loose, hands trembling with agitation. His thoughts spiraled into chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d heard the name &#34;Victoria Hale&#34; back in college. It had floated around a few times, but he&#39;d never cared enough to dig deeper. He didn&#39;t even know what exactly Victoria did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, when Brinley revealed she was Victoria, he&#39;d been a little surprised-but also genuinely happy for her.It meant she had something to strive for, a real career, and that was a good thing. That was why, when she&#39;d asked him to accompany her on stage, he hadn&#39;t refused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing, however, could have prepared him for Hannah&#39;s unexpected presence-or for the storm she&#39;d stirred up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearily, Vincent pressed his fingers to his forehead. Lately, he felt he really didn&#39;t understand Hannah. As for Victoria? He couldn&#39;t care less. Brinley&#39;s well-being-that was what mattered. She couldn&#39;t afford to go through another spell like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes squeezed shut, Brinley tried to control her breathing to keep up her charade, silently counting the seconds. Letting Derek drive her all the way to the ER was out of the question. If doctors started running tests, her lies about the supposed heart condition would unravel right there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Easing her eyes open, Brinley put on a look of confusion, glancing around as if she had just woken up from a coma. &#34;Vincent? Weren&#39;t we just at the event? Why are we driving somewhere?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her awake, Vincent&#39;s tension visibly eased. &#34;You fainted, so we&#39;re on our way to the hospital. Let&#39;s hear what the doctors have to say about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley sat up quickly, clutching his arm with a soft whimper. &#34;Vincent, could we not go to the hospital? I really dislike it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s reply was brisk and emotionless. &#34;We&#39;re not skipping it. Hospital, Brinley.&#34; He figured that heart condition couldn&#39;t be dismissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to hide her rising panic, Brinley clung tighter. &#34;Honestly, I&#39;m feeling much better. Lately, I&#39;ve spent more time in hospitals than anywhere else. I seriously dislike the notion of visiting the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Vincent&#39;s expression remained stern, his tone brooking no argument. &#34;No changes. Hospital. That&#39;s final.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She instantly switched tactics and softened her voice. &#34;Didn&#39;t the doctor say my mood matters most?Hospitals depress me. The smell of antiseptic alone ruins it for me. And I hate being at the hospital-it just reminds me I&#39;m a patient who needs to be taken care of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed unmoved. &#34;We&#39;ll only be in the hospital for a short time. This isn&#39;t up for debate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing his stance hadn&#39;t shifted an inch, Brinley resorted to her last card. Discreetly pinching her thigh,she made her voice tremble. &#34;Vincent, hospitals bring back every awful memory. My father and my brother both died in places like that.It scares me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning his head, Vincent let his gaze drift to the window. The flicker of emotion in his eyes was impossible to read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, Brinley let her voice falter. &#34;If I&#39;d known you&#39;d worry like this, I never would&#39;ve told you about my heart condition at all. Nobody knows my limits better than I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent stayed silent for a while before he finally said, &#34;Fine. Derek, drive us back.&#34;</p>
