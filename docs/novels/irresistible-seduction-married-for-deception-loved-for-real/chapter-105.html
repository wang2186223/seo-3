                <p>With a heavy sigh, Vincent undid the top buttons of his shirt, trying to relieve the tension he felt. &#34;So much has gone on lately,&#34; he muttered. &#34;We haven&#39;t really talked things through in weeks. Maybe a ski trip would give us a chance to catch our breath-just the two of us, without any interruptions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly added, &#34;But if you&#39;re not up for skiing, we can stay indoors at the villa there. Whatever you prefer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension on Hannah&#39;s expression eased a bit.Vincent had a point. They&#39;d been fighting nonstop,and every time she brought up divorce, he&#39;d always brushed it aside as if she were just being dramatic.Perhaps it was time for a serious conversation to end their marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If going on this ski trip meant escaping the Jones estate and finally having a chance to mention the divorce agreement Vincent had signed without realizing it, she&#39;d take it. If he wanted any term to be changed, they could sort it all out at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah relented. &#34;What time are we leaving tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time that night, the tension had finally faded from Vincent&#39;s face. &#34;I&#39;ll text you the details soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah nodded quietly. &#34;I have something important to discuss with you tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, eyes flickering to the shopping bag on the desk, a small spark of hope igniting. He looked back at her, a new seriousness in his voice. &#34;You can tell me now,if you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head. &#34;Not tonight. I&#39;m exhausted.Tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right,&#34; he replied. &#34;Just promise you won&#39;t forget.&#34; She shot him a look. &#34;Aren&#39;t you going to leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleep tight,&#34; he said gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Vincent walked out, and Hannah locked the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour later, Vincent&#39;s message appeared on her phone. &#34;Leaving at ten tomorrow. The private jet will be waiting in the courtyard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She typed a brief &#34;OK&#34; in reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she turned off for the night, sleep stayed out of reach, no matter how hard she tried. Whether it was anxiety or just the weight on her mind, she kept tossing and turning in bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, she got up and rummaged through her drawer,hunting for some melatonin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her search, she nearly grabbed her birth control pills by mistake before finally finding what she needed. Without thinking, she set the birth control pills aside on her nightstand and then took two melatonin tablets. Only after that did her body finally relax enough to drift off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Hannah woke up later than usual. As she made her way toward the stairs, she heard Brinley shouting from the dining room. &#34;You&#39;re going skiing with Hannah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah frowned. Always so loud. So annoying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the breakfast, Brinley had just learned that Vincent had taken a day off. She&#39;d been about to ask what his plans were-only to hear that he was going skiing with Hannah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of jealousy rushed through Brinley. She couldn&#39;t resist asking, &#34;It&#39;s just going to be the two of you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent, unfazed, replied with a simple &#34;Yeah,&#34; his gaze flickering to the top of the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon beamed with approval, &#34;It&#39;s about time you took Hannah out for some fun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica exchanged a glance with Brinley and then tried to keep her tone light. &#34;Vincent, you know,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley hasn&#39;t had a chance to get out much lately.Maybe she could tag along with you and Hannah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon shot her an irritated look. &#34;They&#39;re a married couple going on a trip together. How could Brinley tag along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Sharon&#39;s disapproval clear,.Brinley had no choice but to smile through gritted teeth.&#34;I appreciate the thought, Mrs. Jones, but it really wouldn&#39;t be appropriate for me to tag along when Vincent and HHannah are going together as an item.That said, it has been a while since I last went skiing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words faded away, eyes glistening with disappointment she&#39;d deliberately let through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s expression softened a touch. &#34;If you really want to go skiing, I&#39;ll have Derek arrange a trip for you in a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s head shot up, hope flickering in her gaze.&#34;Will you come with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| won&#39;t,&#34; Vincent answered. &#34;My schedule&#39;s packed afterward. A lot is coming up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d cleared his entire schedule to make room for a three-month break-this one day was already a luxury he had to fight to get.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley felt a pang of disappointment. So this little trip was meant just for Hannah-something Vincent had set aside for Hannah alone. But weren&#39;t they still in a cold war? Did that mean they&#39;d patched things up already?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley looked down, trying to hide the frustration swirling in her eyes. &#34;If you&#39;re not going, then what&#39;s the point?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uneasy silence settled over the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica started to interject but froze when Sharon shot her a firm gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her focus to Vincent, Sharon&#39;s tone grew serious. &#34;Remember, Hannah doesn&#39;t handle the cold well.Pack extra layers for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent let out a light laugh, still in high spirits. &#34;It&#39;s just a quick trip, Grandma. We&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quick trip or not, make sure she stays warm,&#34;Sharon insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent smiled, reassuring as ever. &#34;Don&#39;t fret. I&#39;ll look after her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m more worried you&#39;ll hurt her feelings again,&#34;Sharon murmured under her breath, though she didn&#39;t say anything anymore. She&#39;d seen enough to know how often Hannah was upset because of Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of discomfort crossed Vincent&#39;s face,making it clear he didn&#39;t want to linger on the conversation. &#34;I&#39;ll go check on Hannah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley kept her head down, absently poking at her food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent climbed the stairs and paused outside the guest room.He tried to twist the handle. Locked. He rapped on the door. &#34;Come on. Open up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His knocking came fast and loud, enough to get on Hannah&#39;s nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, Hannah swung the door open, only to see Vincent waiting outside, a smile playing on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; she asked, her tone flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent stepped inside without waiting for an invitation. &#34;We&#39;re leaving soon.Are you packed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah let out a tired breath. &#34;Not yet. I haven&#39;t even washed my face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her morning had been spent going over Nova Tech&#39;s product updates with Felix and requesting the day off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent checked his watch. &#34;No rush. You&#39;ve got thirty minutes. Once you&#39;re ready, we&#39;ll go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Hannah muttered, rubbing her eyes and heading for the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she was gone, Vincent started gathering her things, tossing her skincare products into her bag-she couldn&#39;t use just anything with her sensitive skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he zipped up the pouch, his eyes landed on a small botte left out on the nightstand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked it up, and a chill ran through him as he realized what it was. Birth control? She was taking birth control?</p>
