                <p>Anger tightened every muscle in Vincent&#39;s jaw, his expression nearly black with frustration. &#34;Now my grandmother&#39;s birthday means nothing to you? Only a week remains. She trusted you and handed over all the planning. But you just slipped out before sunrise to see another man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of numbness washed over Hannah. The way he kept repeating &#34;another man&#34;-as if thatwas the only story he could imagine-cut right through her. Not for a moment did he believe that she and Felix just had work to handle. In his world, she had no career, only the title of wife, forever playing house. That was the only version o her he could see. That was the only role he&#39;d ever let her play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hollow ache settled deep in her chest. Eight years of her life, gone, wasted on this man. What did she even have to show for it? An illusion of &#34;happiness.&#34; Even the love itself-fake. But there was one truth he hadn&#39;t exaggerated-seven days remained. Seven days left before the divorce papers would finally mean freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp,sarcastic laugh slipped from Hannah&#39;s lips. &#34;You think my meeting Felix means I&#39;m unfaithful? Then explain you and Brinley. Every single day, you find a reason to see her-how would you label that? Cheating on me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a snap, Vincent tore off his tie, his voice rough with denial. &#34;I&#39;ve told you again and again-nothing is going on between me and Brinley!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;Then it&#39;s not what you think between me and Felix either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Hannah wrenched her arm from his grasp and turned away, drawing a line he could not cross.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why the hell did I find you woke up in his office? If I hadn&#39;t walked in, would you have gone home with him next?&#34; Vincent questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone listening would have pegged Vincent&#39;s outburst as pure jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah, however,recognized the truth. Jealousy had nothing to do with it. What fueled him now was pure fury. His ego had taken a direct hit. Keeping their marriage under wraps was one thing,but watching her share space with another man was something he couldn&#39;t tolerate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No effort went into justifying herself. She didn&#39;t bother to console his wounded pride. &#34;Believe whatever you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, she pushed past him, making for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one swift motion, Vincent caught her by the wrist and tossed her back onto the mattress. &#34;We&#39;re not done here.Where the fuck do you think you&#39;re going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter laugh escaped Hannah as she glared at him. &#34;So now I&#39;m not even allowed to crash in the guest room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage flared in her cheeks. She tried to sit up, but Vincent swung a leg over her, trapping her in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something unreadable flickered in his gaze, dark as midnight. &#34;Is that what all this is about? Separate rooms, repeated talks of divorce-because of Felix?&#34; His voice was taut, nearly trembling. &#34;Is he really that great?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s eyes flashed. &#34;I told you, he&#39;s got nothing to do with it. Now get off me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation took over as she bucked beneath him, her fists flying, but he easily trapped both wrists in his grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his features hidden in the half-light, Vincent hovered over her, unreadable. &#34;Did you sleep with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single question turned Hannah to stone. So this was what he truly believed about her. A wave of tears threatened to spill, sharp and hot with shame, but she clamped down on them, refusing to give him that satisfaction. Long ago, she&#39;d promised herself she would never again cry for Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bastard!&#34; she spat out, her voice trembling with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt of clarity snapped through her as she drove her knee upward, fighting back with every ounce of strength.Both hands remained locked in his grip, or else she would have slapped him on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drove her past the edge of reason. What on earth had drawn her to him in the first place? Had she really been so mesmerized by his handsomeness back then?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get off me.I said get-&#34; The last word was swallowed as Vincent crushed his mouth against hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every trace of tenderness was missing-his kiss crashed into her with raw, desperate hunger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to yield, Hannah pressed her lips together, denying him entry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rough command escaped him.&#34;Let me in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One hand snaked upward, gripping her jaw tightly. His thumb pressed harshly against her cheek, forcing her mouth apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a pause, he plunged forward. His tongue invaded, grazing the roof of her mouth as his breath came hot and uneven against her face.</p>
