                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Vincent said to Derek before shifting hisattention back to Hannah. &#34;P&#39;ll handle this. You stay put and get some rest. From this moment on, I don&#39;t want to hear you mention &#39;divorce&#39; ever again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he stepped out and closed the door behind him. He hadn&#39;t taken Hannah&#39;s talk of divorce seriously. He was convinced Hannah loved him far too deeply to ever mean it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter, almost mocking smile played on Hannah&#39;s lips. He hadn&#39;t even bothered to give her an answer to her simple question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the Bentley, Derek noticed the tension in Vincent&#39;s face, his brows pulled tight with worry.&#34;Another fight with Mrs. Jones?&#34; he asked, his voice cautious as he didn&#39;t want to press too hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reply came from Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek forced a weak laugh, still determined to offer advice.&#34;Mr. Jones, you&#39;re going about this all wrong.Women always need a little sweet-talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek clearly thought he knew a thing or two aboout relationships and was just getting warmed up when Vincent shot him a cold, warning glare. Instantly,he fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s thoughts wandered. His memories took him back to childhood-he had grown up alongside Brinley and her brother. When he was seven, he and her brother had tumbled into the sea together.Brinley&#39;s father had reached him first before going back for his own son, but the tide had been merciless, swallowing them both. Brinley had only been five years old then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking the memory away, Vincent turned to Derek, frown deepening. &#34;Check what happened at Midnight Veil,especially with those two men who&#39;d harassed Brinley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; Derek replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment of hesitation showed on Derek&#39;s face before he asked, &#34;Should I keep looking into the jacket&#39;s owner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep digging into it,&#34; Vincent answered, voice clipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On her end, Hannah still filed a report with the police. Unfortuhately, without concrete evidence,the case remained at a standstill. Determined not to let the matter drop, she brought in a private detective.She was done watching the truth slip away. This time, she promised herself, she would stand her ground and fight back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short while later, she found herself at a phone repair shop-there was a precious photo on that phone, and she needed it restored at any cost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The technician gave her a knowing look and a half-smile. &#34;Let me guess, lost pictures with your boyfriend?Sentimental memories mean a lot, don&#39;t they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah met his gaze with a small, polite smile and stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Competence was clearly the technician&#39;s specialty. In only a few minutes, he managed to power the device back up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nervous energy filled Hannah&#39;s hands as she scrolled through the photos. One album caught her eye-Family. She selected a single black-and-white image and quickly sent it to her new phone. &#34;Everything&#39;s done. Thank you,&#34; she said, gratitude flickering in her soft smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity lingered on the technician&#39;s face. &#34;That&#39;s all? There are dozens more photos in that album.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I just need this one,&#34; she replied simply. For her, the most precious photo was not a picture of her and Vincent, but the ultrasound of their child when it was just a month old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The technician stood by the counter, momentarily puzzled, as Hannah gathered her things and walked away without a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Vincent had once had a child. But he didn&#39;t know. She had been overjoyed when she first learned she was pregnant. She had everything planned-a romantic dinner, a framed printout of the ultrasound,ready to surprise him. But he hadn&#39;t walked through the door that night. His voice had come over the phone,distant and cold. &#34;Don&#39;t wait up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she had wanted to tell him the good news in person. The next morning, she dressed with care, set her disappointment aside, and had the drivertake her straight to Vincent&#39;s office. But no luck-Vincent was nowhere to be found. He had already left the country on an urgent trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretaries had mentioned it had something to do with work tied to a subsidiary, but also to reconnect with his first love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when Hannah had first found out that Vincent&#39;s first love lived abroad. Hurt and furious, she&#39;d kept calling him again and again, but he never once answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the secretaries? They&#39;d scorned her, urging her to stop hanging on to Vincent and do something useful.Said she was perfectly capable-why not earn a decent living instead of being Vincent&#39;s kept woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their words had struck something raw. And Hannah had been at a loss to defend herself. She couldn&#39;t just reveal her secret marriage to Vincent.</p>
