                <p>Vincent&#39;s voice came through, filled with a quiet sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Hannah glanced up, she caught sight of a storm of emotions swirling in his eyes. A trace of reluctance lingered there, almost hidden, but she noticed. That could not be right, could it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking her head, Hannah pushed the thought away. Why would Vincent hesitate to end things with her now? With Brinley&#39;s return, their marriage had a clear expiration date. The only reason he hadn&#39;t broached the subject yet was because of his grandmother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matching his seriousness, Hannah remarked, &#34;Vincent, let&#39;s not even mention those three years we dated.Just focus on the five years we&#39;ve been married. Can you recall a single moment where we were truly happy together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent responded, &#34;I can.&#34; He believed their days had passed by smoothly, free of real arguments, and that calmness equaled happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,Hannah gave a bitter laugh, her lips curling into a half-smile. &#34;That&#39;s not true for me. Through these five years, I can&#39;t recall any happiness. If anything, marrying you has brought me nothing but heartache.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock flickered in Vincent&#39;s eyes, and all color drained from his face. He opened his mouth to speak, his throat working, but no words came out. So, that was how Hannah saw their years together?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s gaze fell to her lap as she reflected. Five years felt like a lifetime. She&#39;d been called a home wrecker and even scorned by those in high society while she was actually Vincent&#39;s rightful wife. Danica had never hidden her contempt, and Vincent had rarely come home to care. For ages, she&#39;d barely dared to leave their house. The latest blow had been her parents&#39; worry about her marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She realized that each heartbreak and every bit of loneliness-all because she became Vincent&#39;s wife. If they had married for love, it might have been bearable, but the truth was, this marriage lacked love entirely.Vincent&#39;s heart was never hers. She had always just filled a vacancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had never chased after him all those years ago, maybe she could have spared herself all this pain.Regret pressed heavily on her heart. If only she&#39;d never crossed paths with Vincent, perhaps her world would be less complicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not divorcing you.&#34; Only after a long pause did those words finally break free, the strain obvious in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling her eyes, Hannah didn&#39;t take his statement seriously. Of course, he would marry Brinley someday.The divorce was inevitable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing in Hannah&#39;s expression betrayed any feeling. &#34;Move out of my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do you think you&#39;re headed?&#34; Vincent&#39;s brow creased as he watched her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah found it amusing that he&#39;d asked her the same question twice, as if on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what you expect from me, Vincent,&#34; Hannah replied, unable to hide her irritation.&#34;Doyou really want me to sleep in a bed you saved for your future life with Brinley?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not leaving this room. This is where you&#39;ll sleep,&#34; Vincent insisted, refusing to budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s ridiculous. There&#39;s no chance I&#39;m staying in here,&#34; Hannah retorted, her anger bubbling over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, she raised her knee, feigning a kick, but Vincent stepped aside with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing her chance, she slipped through the open door. Being in the same room with Vincent made the air suffocating. With her back to him, she said, &#34;Starting today, I&#39;ll sleep in the guest room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She resolved that after his grandmother&#39;s birthday, she wouldn&#39;t return to this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, she marched across the hall, pushed open the guest room door, and shut it behind her without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent, left standing alone, leaned heavily against the door, his throat burning. He&#39;d given up cigarettes when they started trying for a baby. But now, irritation gnawed at him. He found himself reaching for a cigarette from the drawer, lighting it with trembling hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smoke quickly filled the room, making it impossible to read the turmoil in Vincent&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstáirs, Danica caught the sounds drifting up from below and couldn&#39;t resist spying from the stairwell.Upon discovering that Hannah and Vincent would be spending the night in separate rooms, she couldn&#39;t have been happier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, Danica rushed off, eager to share the good news with Brinley.</p>
