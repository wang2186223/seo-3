                <p>&#34;I&#39;m leaning toward Hannah&#39;s proposal.&#34; Sharon reached over and gave Hannah&#39;s hand a gentle pat. &#34;Thank you for your effort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bright smile lit up Hannah&#39;s face. &#34;I&#39;m really glad you like it, Sharon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah pulled Sharon into a warm hug, even nestling her face against Sharon&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone watching would have found the moment truly touching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent looked on, feeling a stab of unease. That kind of smile from Hannah hadn&#39;t been directed at him for a very long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Sharon was in the room, Danica never had a say. Instead, she placed a comforting hand on Brinley&#39;s shoulder.She figured that once Hannah wrapped up the divorce procedure and left the Jones family behind,Brinley would have plenty of opportunities to shine. For now, it didn&#39;t hurt to let Hannah enjoy her victory,just one birthday celebration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica felt no concern at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sting of disappointment settled in Brinley&#39;s chest, her nails pressing hard into her palms. &#34;Sharon, why did you choose Hannah&#39;s plan over mine? I spent four days working on my own plan. How could you dismiss my plan as less thoughtful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears crept into Brinley&#39;s words. &#34;You&#39;ve watched me grow up. I have viewed you as my grandmother. I just wanted to do something that would bring you happiness, but you make me feel like I don&#39;t belong, like I&#39;m just some outsider.&#34; Her tone was filled with hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mocking smile played at the corners of Hannah&#39;s mouth. The divorce wasn&#39;t even final, yet Brinley already pictured herself as a true member of the Jones family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s emotional plea didn&#39;t move Sharon at all. Sharon&#39;s expression stayed stern and composed. &#34;But you are indeed an outsider. At best, you&#39;re the child of a late friend. Since you left for overseas, we&#39;ve hardly been in contact, and that&#39;s the full extent of our relationship. You don&#39;t need to, and you don&#39;t have the right to plan my birthday celebration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing to let her words sink in, she added, &#34;Also, there are only eight days until my birthday party. Many of Hannah&#39;s arrangements are already set in motion, while your ideas are still in the early stages. You suggested a lawn party, but the venue needs to be booked a month ahead. Clearly, you haven&#39;t followed up with your proposal. In every way, Hannah&#39;s plan is more suitable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speechless, Brinley could only look toward Vincent for help. Her voice cracked. &#34;Vincent, I really did put my heart into this...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s jaw tightened as he spoke.&#34;My grandma has the final say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence settled over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting her lip, Brinley muttered, &#34;You&#39;re all against me because my father and brother are gone,&#34;then hurried upstairs in tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her outburst left the rest of the group exchanging uneasy looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica leaned closer to Vincent and gave him a nudge. &#34;Vincent, shouldn&#39;t you go after Brinley? She might need someone right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent shot a sharp look in Hannah&#39;s direction, his eyes sending a silent warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah understood immediately. Vincent blamed her for having Sharon&#39;s support, making his first love upset.What a twisted logic. Bitterness flickered at the corners of her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent was just about to walk toward the stairs when Sharon stopped him with a raised hand. &#34;Stay here.The one you should be accompanying now is your wife,&#34; she said sternly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of Vincent&#39;s company made Hannah&#39;s skin prickle. She wanted no part of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill crept into Vincent&#39;s reply. &#34;Grandma, Brinley&#39;s not well. She fainted just earlier, and being scolded in front of everyone probably made her upset. I have to go check on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of exhaustion washed over Hannah. Brinley&#39;s heart condition seemed to give her power over Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s heart had been numb for so long that she couldn&#39;t feel the pain anymore. Fortunately, she was about to divorce Vincent, and this wouldn&#39;t last much longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon made another attempt to stop Vincent, but Hannah reached out and gently squeezed Sharon&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hand. &#34;It&#39;s aIright, Sharon. Let him go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent made his way upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trailing close behind, Danica wore a satisfied smirk. The truth was plain-Vincent&#39;s concern belonged to Brinley. Not even Sharon&#39;s support would keep Hannah from being kicked out once the birthday party ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After soothing Sharon, Hannah made her way back up to her room on the second floor. The moment she stepped inside, she sensed something was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing looked the same anymore. The crib that once sat in the corner had vanished without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced around and saw that her dried flowerframe was no longer on the vanity table. Even the bed that Vincent had specially brought had been replaced by something new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of the calm, simple décor she loved, the whole space now felt extravagant and overly feminine.Gone were the mist-blue curtains she and Vincent had chosen together, replaced now with a glaring shade of pink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything,from the wardrobe to the sofa to the makeup table, had been swapped out for something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears stung Hannah&#39;s eyes. One single day away, and Vincent hadn&#39;t wasted any time making the room unrecognizable, erasing the life they had built together. It made sense now why he was out shopping for wedding dresses with Brinley. He had already redecorated the room for his future life with Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bitterness in Hannah&#39;s eyes grew sharper. For someone like Vincent, she had been nothing more than a temporary stand-in, explaining his lack of hesitation in shattering the rare, shared sweetness from their past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it didn&#39;t matter. Since he had already transformed the room holding the precious memories, she refused to hang onto it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few paces, she turned around and hurried toward the bed. Her suspicion was confirmed-the diary she&#39;d hidden was nowhere to be found. That diary, which held the whole story of how she met Vincent,how she fell in love, and eventually married him, had vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, she&#39;d kept it at the house in Lakeshore Villa. But once Brinley had paid a visit there, Hannah had moved it to the Jones family estate instead. It was supposed to be a keepsake, but it was lost in the end.Maybe it was better this way. She had already made up her mind to get a divorce from Vincent. No point dwelling on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah slung her bag over her shoulder, walked to the door, and reached for the handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she pulled the door open, Vincent appeared right in front of her,about to enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her one look, clearly displeased to find her ready to leave. &#34;It&#39;s late,&#34; he said coldly. &#34;Where are you planning to go?&#34;</p>
