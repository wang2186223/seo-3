                <p>Very few people had ever challenged Vincent so openly. With a shaky hand, Gordon Brown, Rena&#39;s father,wiped sweat from his brow and gently pulled his daughter a step closer to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent cast a cold glance at Rena. Without even sparing Gordon a look, he said, his voice low and heavy,&#34;Mr. Brown, your daughter seems to need a reminder about when it&#39;s her turn to speak-and when silence would serve her better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quick to nod, Gordon rushed to agree. &#34;You&#39;re right. I&#39;Il make sure to discipline her properly. Rena, you need to apologize this instant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His desperate glance at her begged for cooperation, but Rena acted ignorant of her father&#39;s unspoken message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena shifted her head away and huffed, &#34;I didn&#39;t say anything wrong. Why should I have to apologize at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s expression barely changed as he looked at Rena. His voice was stripped of emotion. &#34;In that case,the Browns should consider their partnership with the Jones Group over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned on his heel and left, making no effort to hide his disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, Mr.Jones!&#34; Panic drove Gordon to chase after Vincent, dragging Rena with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frozen in place, Hannah felt her heart turn cold. Vincent was clearly lashing out, punishing her by targeting the Browns. Determined to make things right, she slipped after Vincent, searching for even a small chance to talk. The Browns couldn&#39;t afford to lose this contract because of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brinley guided Vincent through the crowd so smoothly that Hannah never got close. Instead, her breath caught at what happened next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miles, the very person Hannah had hoped to cooperate with, extended a hand to Brinley with an easy smile.&#34;Victoria, I&#39;ve heard so much about you. Meeting you at last feels long overdue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley was momentarily stunned by the striking man in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent murmured to her, &#34;This is Miles Whitaker, CEO of VitraMind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley quickly recovered and remarked, &#34;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you, Mr.Whitaker.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miles nodded, and his assistant, Kenneth, handed her a business card. &#34;I have a strong interest in women&#39;s safety innovations. Hopefully, we&#39;ll find an opportunity to collaborate soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley couldn&#39;t hide her delight as she accepted the business card with both hands. &#34;I appreciate that so much,&#34;she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley turned to Vincent, whose eyes were shining with approval. Attending this event had turned out to be the right choice, surpassing her expectations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah took a quiet breath and pushed through the crowd. &#34;Miss Gilbert, you claim you&#39;re Victoria. Do you have anything to prove it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question rattled Brinley, and for an instant, panic flashed across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sidelong look from Miles revealed that he recognized Hannah as the neighbor from downstairs-the one who&#39;d made a point to get close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A champagne flute dangled from Vincent&#39;s hand as he fixed Hannah with a cold stare. &#34;This isn&#39;t the moment for dramatics,&#34; he said, his tone biting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disregarding his warning, Hannah pressed on. &#34;Last I checked, Victoria carries a seal engraved with her name. Do you have it, Miss Gilbert?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regaining her composure quickly, Brinley answered, &#34;Yes... Yes, I have it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interest piqued, Miles, Sloane, and a handful of other guests now watched Brinley closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s eyes, however, stayed fixed on Hannah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly little smile, Hannah asked, &#34;Is that so? In that case, would you mind showing it to us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unamused look flickered on Brinley&#39;s face. &#34;You really expect me to carry it to an event like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping her voice even, Brinley continued, &#34;You questioned my identity in front of everyone, and I agree that proof is needed. I&#39;d hate for someone else to take Victoria&#39;s name for themselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh escaped Hannah, edged with sarcasm. She couldn&#39;t believe Brinley was actually suggesting she had bad intentions. The nerve of Brinley stealing her identity as Victoria while throwing accusations her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah had just opened her mouth to argue when Brinley held up her phone. &#34;If I weren&#39;t truly Victoria,how would I have been talking to those from the women&#39;s empowerment website all this time? Take a look for yourselves!&#34;</p>
