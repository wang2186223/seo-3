                <p>Vincent seized the back of Hannah&#39;s neck and pressed her against the vanity. His breath came in hot bursts as he leaned even closer. &#34;Then let&#39;s test it again. See if I really suck at kissing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah jerked her head away, planting both hands on his chest to shove him back. &#34;Let go of me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Vincent only tightened his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger flashed through her. She drove her knee into his stomach. Her elbow knocked over the makeup on the table, sending compacts and bottles tumbling onto the wool carpet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in rough breaths, Vincent grabbed for her wrists, using his knee to pry her legs apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, all at once, Hannah stopped struggling. Her stare was cold and empty as she looked up at him.&#34;Don&#39;t touch me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made him froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She used the moment to break free, shoving him away. With one quick motion, she wiped her mouth and said in a low voice, &#34;You make me sick.&#34;	~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt those words land hard, as if she had slapped him.&#34;Sick?&#34; he asked sharply, yanking her back so roughly that she nearly lost her balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wrist reddened where his hand gripped too tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah snapped back. &#34;Now, whenever you touch me, I feel like throwing up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something sharp flickered across his expression. Still, instead of releasing her, he only squeezed harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their breathing mingled in the air-hers coming out fast and angry, his heavy and harsh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They faced each other in silence until loud pounding on the door echoed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s shrill voice cut through the tension. &#34;Hlannah! Open this door right now!&#34; She tried the handle,finding it locked. &#34;Why are you locking doors in the middle of the day? What exactly are you hiding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second voice sounded from outside, this one softer and pleading-Brinley.&#34;Danica, perhaps we should just let it go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica was not having it.&#34;NO,Brinley. You&#39;re always too gentle. That&#39;s why people take advantage of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One thing was clear.Danica would not stop until she got what she wanted for Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hannah, open this door!&#34; Danica&#39;s pounding grew even louder. &#34;Don&#39;t make me repeat myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lock clicked at last, but it was Vincent who swung the door open, not Hannah. His face was stormy with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s eyes widened in shock. &#34;Vincent? What are you doing here? I thought you already left for work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t,&#34; he muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Danica missed the strained atmosphere, Brinley caught it right away, and her gaze went straight to Hannah&#39;s lips. It was obvious enough what had just taken place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of jealousy burned in Brinley&#39;s eyes. She had practically begged Vincent to touch her, and he never did. Yet, with Hannah, in the middle of the day, he could not seem to help himself. What made Hannah so special? Wasn&#39;t she just a stand-in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quick to hide her feelings, Brinley adjusted her expression and played her part.&#34;Danica, let&#39;s just leave it alone. There&#39;s no point arguing.&#34;	a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica gave her hand a reassuring pat, still unwilling to back down. &#34;Absolutely not. We can&#39;t just let this slide. Vincent deserves to know what kind of person Hannah really is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;Then go on. Tell everyone what supposed wrongdoings I did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s expression changed. &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica wasted no time, thrusting her phone at him. &#34;Vincent, you have to look at this. Look at what Hannah&#39;s done! These messages prove it-she wanted to hurt Brinley!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Screenshots filled the phone&#39;s display, all showing conversations that seemed to suggest Hannah had arranged for someone to rape Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley stood off to the side, eyes glistening with tears, her face an image of heartbreak and innocence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pointing straight at Hannah, Danica&#39;s voice grew shrill with accusation. &#34;You hired someone to harass Brinley! What do you have to say now?&#34;</p>
