                <p>Hannah glanced at the message, and a dry laugh escaped her lips. So that was why Vincent didn&#39;t come back-because of Brinley, again. She should&#39;ve known. He had already taken Brinley on an overseas trip without a second thought. Why would he care about her parents?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp pain clutched her chest. It lingered, deep and dull, but she endured it numbly. She suddenly felt the urge to cry. But she held it in. After all, she&#39;d made a silent vow-no more tears wasted on Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without pausing by the parked cars, Hannah slid into the driver&#39;s seat and steered toward the Jones estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through the drive, Rena&#39;s name flashed across the dashboard screen. Instinctively, Hannah figured Rena was calling to check in about the latest  scandal online. The moment she answered, she tried to sound steady. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Rena. I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena&#39;s voice tightened with concern. &#34;Wait, you already know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wrinkle formed between Hannah&#39;s brows. That edge in Rena&#39;s voice hinted at something else entirely. &#34;What happened?&#34; she asked, keeping her eyes on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena wasted no time. &#34;Work sent me to Calveria for a few days. As soon as I finished, I thought I&#39;d treat myself.Guess who I ran into at a couple&#39;s restaurant?Brinley and Vincent. Together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with all the bracing she&#39;d done, Hannah&#39;s heart skipped a beat before the ache returned. Vincent wouldn&#39;t spare time for lunch with her parents, but he had no trouble whisking Brinley off for a cozy meal.How ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena could barely contain her anger. &#34;Vincent is unbelievable! He&#39;s still your husband, yet he&#39;s flaunting his affair in another country? What does he take you for? Leave it to me, Hannah. I&#39;ll make sure they regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rena.&#34; Hannah&#39;s voice came out a few seconds later, quiet and steady. &#34;Don&#39;t ruin their dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why shouldn&#39;t I? Aren&#39;t you upset?&#34; Rena asked,genuinely baffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah replied, &#34;I don&#39;t see any point in getting worked up.&#34; After all, she didn&#39;t want Vincent anymore. And she certainly didn&#39;t care anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her words, Rena remained unconvinced. &#34;Are you honestly alright? Please, Hannah, just promise me you won&#39;t do anything rash because of that scumbag.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their friendship had its roots in a university competition years ago. Back in those days, Hannah&#39;s drive and brilliance had set her apart. She&#39;d built Nova Tech from scratch. That shared commitment to women&#39;s empowerment was what brought them together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, things had changed after Hannah became Vincent&#39;s wife, leaving her career behind to focus solely on home and marriage. Rumors had swirled in their circles, painting her as nothing more than Vincent&#39;s kept woman. The talk had been vicious,sharpened by envy and spite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long time, Hannah had rarely left the house.Facing the world meant risking the sting of stares and snide remarks, and for a long time, that fear had kept her indoors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Transformation did not come overnight. In time,though, Hannah gradually discovered her own strength and refused to let people push her around.These days, few dared to test her patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one understood the cost of that battle more than Rena. Empathy made Rena&#39;s heart ache for her friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle tone slipped into Hannah&#39;s words. &#34;promise I&#39;m alright, Rena. There&#39;s just one thing |need. Would you take a few photos of them for me?It&#39;s important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, several pictures appeared in Hannah&#39;s inbox, showing Brinley and Vincent seated together,facing each other across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Composure never left Hannah. She simply tucked the images away, saying nothing. Her parents had been subjected to an agonizing dinner, all thanks to Vincent, while he was out enjoying dinner with his mistress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disgust flickered across Hannah&#39;s face, silent but clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena spoke again. &#34;No way. I won&#39;t let him have a pleasant meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena gave no warning or offered no details. She stayed on the call, and suddenly, the background filled with the lively hum of the restaurant and the crisp echo of footsteps, signaling her approach to Vincent&#39;s table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Jones, seems like you&#39;re having quite the evening,&#34; Rena remarked, her voice light. Vincent&#39;s only response was a tight-lipped frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of confusion swept over Brinley. &#34;And who exactly are you?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena tossed out a sly grin, her words sharp with sarcasm. &#34;Let&#39;s just say crossing me would be your worst idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next second, Hannah heard the sound of a table being flipped over through the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Theatrics poured from Rena next, her voice booming,soaked in exaggerated sobs as she pointed at Vincent. &#34;How can you be out romancing your mistress when my best friend is alone at the hospital,about to have a baby? You absolute scumbag!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every ounce of calm in Vincent evaporated on the spot. Ice flickered in his eyes, but the room around him erupted with gossip and curious stares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wicked smile curled on Rena&#39;s lips as she triedto slip away, only to have her exit blocked by a waiter.She jabbed a finger in Vincent&#39;s direction. &#34;See him over there? He&#39;ll handle the bill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Rena escaped the restaurant, her laughter spilled back through the phone. &#34;Hannah,you should&#39;ve been there. Vincent looked like he&#39;d swallowed a thundercloud!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gratitude shone in Hannah&#39;s quiet laugh. &#34;Thanks,Rena.&#34; The smile lingered, gentle and real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They lingered on the call a bit longer, trading a few more words before saying goodbye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once alone, Hannah&#39;s warmth faded, replaced by resolve as she dialed her attorney. &#34;Have you got everything lined up?&#34; No time remained for excuses -Danica&#39;s constant delays had already tested her limits. The property transfer was already set in motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Assurance came quickly. &#34;All the paperwork&#39;s ready.Just need signatures to finalize everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she said, &#34;I&#39;ll come get you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, Hannah swung by to pick up her attorney before making a beeline for the Jones estate. The sting of Danica&#39;s cruel words to her parents still echoed in her mind. There was no way she would simply let that go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Hannah confirmed that Sharon was resting peacefully, she made straight for Danica&#39;s room without a single pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stretched across the bed in a drunken mess, Danica looked oblivious to the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s next move took her to the kitchen, where she filled a hefty jar with cold water and brought it right back. She didn&#39;t hesitate as she splashed the water on Danica.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock of cold water sent Danica surging upright,choking out a gasp, her hair and clothes drenched.Her eyes landed immediately on Hannah, who stood over her without a flicker of regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury twisted Danica&#39;s face as she dragged a sleeve across her dripping cheeks. &#34;Hannah, what&#39;s gotten into you?&#34; she shouted, her voice ragged. An arm came up, ready to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quick as lightning, Hannah seized Danica&#39;s wrist,cutting off the slap before it started. With a sudden movement, she brought the glass jar crashíng down on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The harsh sound filled the room, making Danica shrink back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold, steady glare met Danica&#39;s eyes. &#34;You&#39;re always whining about the stench of poverty,&#34; Hannah replied. &#34;I figured I&#39;d help you rinse it off.&#34;</p>
