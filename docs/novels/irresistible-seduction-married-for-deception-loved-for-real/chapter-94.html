                <p>With Sharon&#39;s birthday drawing near, the Jones estate buzzed with constant movement and busy energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hosts practiced their parts in one corner while decorators transformed every room in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of Hannah&#39;s days remained devoted to her work at Nova Tech, but any spare time she found was spent overseeing the birthday banquet preparations back at the estate. Communication with Vincent had ceased entirely since that last confrontation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Progress on Nova Tech&#39;s latest product couldn&#39;t have gone better-something that gave Hannah a rare sense of satisfaction in the middle of everything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Sharon hadn&#39;t insisted on her company at nearly every evening meal, Hannah would gladly have buried herself in the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day, catching Hannah just after a meeting, Felix suggested, &#34;Let&#39;s grab lunch at the mall and go for a shopping session today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A puzzled look crossed Hannah&#39;s face. &#34;Why the sudden urge to shop?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix&#39;s tone turned earnest. &#34;You&#39;re the reason the hormone monitor bracelet project is moving SO quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah replied, never one to take all the credit,&#34;Really, it&#39;s the result of the team&#39;s efforts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without the collective effort, she knew the project would never have come this far so fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix&#39;s smile returned. &#34;Everyone on the team will see bonuses, and you deserve a reward too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, lips curving with gratitude.&#34;That&#39;s thoughtful, Felix, but it isn&#39;t necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His determination didn&#39;t waver. &#34;Well, I insist on rewarding you. Either join me today, or I&#39;ll be waiting at the mall until you do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, alright, you win.&#34; A burst of laughter followed Hannah as she exited the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had the door clicked shut than Felix retrieved a small jewelry box hidden beneath his notebook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, nestled in velvet, lay a gold bracelet engraved with a delicate yellow rose-Hannah&#39;s favorite flower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For days, he&#39;d meant to present it to her under the excuse of appreciation for the project&#39;s success,yet nerves always held him back. Eventually, he settled on the mall outing as the perfect coverto finally give her the gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jewelry box in hand, Felix made his way to the mall,rehearsing how he might deliver his surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Vincent&#39;s workload had reached a breaking point. At first, he&#39;d imagined a month off would be enough to get close to Hannah again, but now he doubted even three months would suffice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the secretarial pool, stress was at a boiling point.Work meant for an entire quarter was now squeezed into a single frantic week.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side of town, Brinley reeled from her recent loss at acquiring Nova Tech and set her sights on fresh opportunities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One particular company-a leader in hit mobile games for women-caught her attention. Despite its runaway popularity, mismanagement and weak monetization had left the business teetering on bankruptcy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley saw enormous potential. She believed the key to any great product, especially those aimed at women, was understanding their desires-she got that right, and the market would always follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s relentless schedule meant he was not available when Brinley wanted him to join her for the acquisition, forcing her to manage negotiations alone. Now, all that stood between her and the deal was a signature on the final contract.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their asking price was five million-a figure that immediately reminded her of Nova Tech&#39;s last negotiation.Confidence fueled her every step. She felt certain Vincent would greenlight the investment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley made her way to Vincent&#39;s office this morning, as informed by Clive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One look at Vincent and her eyes caught the faint red marks across his neck, still visible even after a couple of days. She couldn&#39;t hold back any longer and asked about them. He brushed it off, claiming he was scratched by a cat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley wasn&#39;t convinced for a second. Given the cold tension she&#39;d seen between Hannah and Vincent at the estate, she quickly pieced things together-those marks had Hannah written all over them. Clearly, a major fight had erupted between the couple, and the aftermath was pure silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching their relationship unravel brought a secret sense of satisfaction to Brinley-the more explosive their arguments, the closer they moved to divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing by Vincent&#39;s desk, Brinley set the contract in front of him. &#34;Vincent, I&#39;m nearly finished with the acquisition talks. This is the draft for the game company-please review it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He peered up at her, eyebrow raised. &#34;So, Nova Tech&#39;s off your radar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight shrug accompanied her answer. &#34;Chances of getting Nova Tech are slim to noné. After you left, I tried persuading Felix for quite a while. He&#39;s holding firm, so I turned my attention to another company that&#39;s got plenty of potential.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Vincent murmured, already absorbed in the contract. For a while, Brinley lingered nearby,noticed his mug was empty, and without missing a beat,brewed him a new cup of coffee before quietly setting it at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small flicker of acknowledgement crossed Vincent&#39;s face as he watched her. &#34;Brinley, you really don&#39;t have to do all this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s just it, Vincent-I want to,&#34; she replied, her smile soft and unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Running errands for him, however minor, brought Brinley genuine contentment. This was the life she&#39;d always imagined. If they married, she&#39;d manage every detail of his world. Quiet optimism lingered in her heart, fueling her daily efforts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued finding tasks to busy herself with, and after a while, Vincent stopped protesting and let her be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once her hands were idle, Brinley glanced at her phone and noticed the time had slipped right up to noon. &#34;How about grabbing lunch together?&#34; she suggested, hopeful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent didn&#39;t look up, his pen moving steadily over the page. &#34;I&#39;m not hungry,&#34; came his brief reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Brinley could coax him further, her phone buzzed with a new notification. A message had just landed in a high-profile group chat-a photo of Felix and Hannah together, instantly igniting rumors that Hannah had found a new benefactor after being dumped by Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement flashed in Brinley&#39;s eyes as she picked up on the location of Felix and Hannah were seen. She turned toward Vincent with a meaningful look.&#34;Vincent, I was thinking about shopping for a present for Sharon&#39;s birthday. Would you go with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A curt reply came from him. &#34;I&#39;m tied up today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of disappointment clouded Brinley&#39;s features.&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll let you work. I&#39;ll just pick something out on my own. Still, after what Sharon has said about me before, I&#39;m afraid she won&#39;t like whatever l choose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Vincent checked his watch and clicked the cap onto his pen. &#34;You have twenty minutes, that&#39;s all I can spare.&#34;</p>
