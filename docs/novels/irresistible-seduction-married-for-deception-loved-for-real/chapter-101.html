                <p>The past was the past. Hannah had no desire to revisit it-her focus stayed ahead. Her pursuit of Vincent had been driven by his good looks, and their ending marked by a broken vow. How disgraceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s voice carried casual ease, but Felix&#39;s eyes betrayed a trace of pity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, Hannah and Felix returned to their workplace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once seated, Hannah placed the bag containing the suit by her chair when her phone buzzed with a new alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley had sent yet another image. It showed a close-up of her left ring finger, adorned with a new band.&#34;Vincent picked out our ring. Isn&#39;t it lovely?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah released a hollow chuckle. No wonder she had bumped into Vincent and Brinley earlier-he&#39;d been out choosing wedding rings with Brinley. The wedding gown, the bedding, and now the ring. They were ticking off every ceremony milestone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannàh tapped open the chat with Brinley and wrote.&#34;Hideous thing. Vincent&#39;s taste is appalling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Hannah blocked Brinley. She wouldn&#39;t allow anyone to ruin her day anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent headed back to his office, while Brinley returned to the Jones estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon seeing Hannah&#39;s reply, Brinley attempted to respond with, &#34;Already upset, huh?&#34; But the message wouldn&#39;t go through. She&#39;d been blocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Burning with anger, Brinley muttered a curse beneath her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Danica learned of Brinley&#39;s return, she emerged from her room with a warm welcome.&#34;Brinley, want something to eat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m good, Mrs. Jones.&#34; Brinley linked her arm with Danica&#39;s and guided Danica to the sofa. Grinning slyly, she leaned in and murmured, &#34;Guess who Vincent and I ran into today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hannah,&#34; Brinley drawled lazily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s face immediately twisted with disdain.&#34;Did she try to stir up trouble again? Gee! That woman pops up everywhere. Always going on about how she&#39;s done with Vincent, but clearly she still cares-probably following you two around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley wasn&#39;t done. &#34;Actually, she wasn&#39;t alone. A man was by her side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Danica&#39;s brows shot up. &#34;She&#39;s seeing someone already? How dare she cheat on my son!&#34;Her voice rose with outrage. &#34;No wonder she&#39;s signed those divorce documents so quickly. She already had someone else lined up! Did Vincent see her with another man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley gave a confirming nod. &#34;He did. For the second time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s voice turned razor-sharp. &#34;That tramp! Not even legally single, and already hanging on another man? Utterly disgraceful. Thank heavens Vincent is walking away from her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica rose in a rush. &#34;I&#39;m going to confront her myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley stepped in. &#34;Hold on-don&#39;t go storming off just yet. We need something solid. If you charge in now, she&#39;ll just deny it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the plan, then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley stroked her jaw thoughtfully as she laid it out.&#34;We stay quiet for now. We can&#39;t alert her. And Sharon must not hear a word. Let&#39;s gather proof before we expose everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica inhaled sharply, working to smother her rage.&#34;Alright. We&#39;ll do this your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the Jones Group headquarters, Derek walked into Vincent&#39;s office with an update in hand.&#34;Mr. Jones, regarding the redecoration of your room,some furniture is on the way-you still want me to arrange it according to the draft you provided?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No longer necessary,&#34; Vincent answered coolly,eyes glued to the document in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood. I&#39;ll cancel the orders. Though the crib&#39;s a problem. That supplier doesn&#39;t accept returns,&#34;Derek muttered as he neared the door, only to be halted. &#34;Hold on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek quickly turned back. &#34;Yes? Anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep the crib.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. Where should I place it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent gave him a frosty look.&#34;My home has plenty of rooms. Can&#39;t you just pick one to place it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34; Derek nodded in compliance, completely in the dark about the meaning behind the change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s abrupt shift in demeanor sent a cold ripple through the secretarial department. No one dared breathe too loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent stared at the contract lying before him. It was his third read-and not a word had registered.With a grunt, he grabbed his phone. No messages from Hannah. As expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, he noticed the buzz in the elite social group chat. Curious, he clicked inside. The topic of the day? Hannah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s glare darkened with each message. Crude remarks, vulgar flirts, and lustful words-aimed squarely at Hannah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swiped past the filth, fists clenching-until a single image froze him solid. In it, a sales assistant fastened a bracelet on Hannah&#39;s wrist. Standing beside Hannah was Felix, his gaze on her, all gentle and tender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s face clouded over. So that was why Hannah brought a suit for Felix. Felix had gifted her first. They looked every bit like a couple in a loving relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s laugh was sharp, jagged, and bitter. His eyes were ablaze with silent fury.</p>
