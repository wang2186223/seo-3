                <p>Not hesitating for a moment, Hannah brushed off Vincent&#39;s hand and faced the officers. &#34;I&#39;m Hannah Scott.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Vincent step in so quickly to protect Hannah, Brinley felt a twinge of annoyance. Still, she smothered her resentment and let a victorious smile settle in-what exquisite timing for the police to show up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica looked like she could burst from delight. She even nudged Hannah with a playful push and said to the officers, &#34;Yeah, that&#39;s her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah shifted slightly and locked eyes with Brinley, who shot her a challenging glare over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One second, Brinley was smug, and the next, she transformed into a picture of nervous concern.&#34;Please,officers, don&#39;t take Hannah away. I&#39;ve decided-I don&#39;t want to go through with pressing charges.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica, clearly displeased with this, raised her voice. &#34;Oh, Brinley, why are you being so soft and forgiving?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Sharon finds out about Hannah&#39;s arrest, she&#39;ll be upset.&#34; Mock defensiveness slipped into Brinley&#39;s tone as she clutched Vincent&#39;s hand. &#34;Vincent, you have to do something. Please help Hannah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill settled in Hannah&#39;s expression as she watched Brinley&#39;s performance. She knew Brinley couldn&#39;t wait to see her get taken away. As for Vincent, after what he&#39;d just accused her of, she doubted he&#39;d suddenly intervene for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Scott, we&#39;ll need you to come with us,&#34; the officer remarked firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a steadying breath, Hannah nodded. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll cooperate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent stepped forward, gently patting her hand as a silent promise to stand by her side. &#34;I&#39;m going with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing how Vincent held Hannah&#39;s hand, Brinley&#39;s expression chilled once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flashed in Danica&#39;s eyes as she grabbed Vincent&#39;s arm. &#34;Vincent, have you lost your mind? If the press finds out, it&#39;ll be a PR nightmare for the Jones Group!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent seemed ready to respond, but before he could say anything, Hannah calmly slipped her hand out of his grasp. Her voice was sharp and cold. &#34;I don&#39;t need anyone to accompany me. I&#39;m perfectly fine on my own. Officer, let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance deepened the lines on Vincent&#39;s face as he watched her pull away with such distance. He hated that wall between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner of the room, a second officer approached, a set of handcuffs ready in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement flickered across Brinley&#39;s face. She could barely contain her joy at the thought of seeing those cuffs on Hannah&#39;s wrists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But those cuffs never found their way to Hannah&#39;s wrists. A turn of events followed as the second officer addressed the group instead, &#34;Can someone tell me which of you is Brinley Gilbert?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley stepped forward, confidence unshaken.&#34;That&#39;s me,&#34; she answered, thinking they might need her statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Gilbert, you are now under investigation for encouraging harassment, manufacturing false accusations,and slander.Please come with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All color drained from Brinley&#39;s face.&#34;W-What do you mean?&#34; This wasn&#39;t supposed to happen. Weren&#39;t the police after Hannah? A note of hysteria entered her voice. &#34;There must be a mistake! I&#39;m the one whofiled the report!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second officer said bluntly, &#34;No mistake at all. After your complaint, we followed up and discovered clear evidence of your involvement. You fabricated events and framed Ms. Scott, seriously harming Ms.Scott&#39;s reputation. We have more than enough reason to bring you in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic turned Danica&#39;s cheeks ashen. She hurried to Brinley&#39;s side and confronted the second officer.&#34;Wait,that can&#39;t be right! Weren&#39;t you supposed to arrest Hannah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second officer&#39;s tone remained steady. &#34;That was never the case. Ms. Scott reported what happened long before Ms. Gilbert did. After gathering the facts, it&#39;s clear Ms. Gilbert is responsible. She will be taken into custody.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wild denial twisted Brinley&#39;s expression. &#34;No! This is wrong! I didn&#39;t do any of it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation sent Brinley searching for support. She turned to Vincent, but his attention never left Hannah.Grabbing for his sleeve, she begged, &#34;Vincent, you have to believe me. I&#39;m innocent-ths is a setup!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Brinley shot Hannah a glare full of accusation and fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One eyebrow raised, Hannah simply met Brinley&#39;s stare with a calm, unbothered challenge.Did Brinley really think she was the only one who would play games? Hardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind the scenes, Hannah had already brought in a private detective, keeping a close eye on every move.Once the news reached her that Brinley had tried to buy off those two men and shift the blame onto her,Hannah had wasted no time capturing the whole scheme on tape and passed the proof to the police. That decision was what set everything in motion and led to the scene unfolding now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officer moved to cuff Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With panic written all over her face, Brinley tried to back away. &#34;No! I can&#39;t wear those! I haven&#39;t done anything wrong!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica, unable to hide her outrage, blurted out, &#34;You don&#39;t even have the facts straight! Why are you treating her like a criminal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warning echoed in the officer&#39;s voice. &#34;Please let us do our job. If you continue to interfere, we&#39;ll have no choice but to act.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In desperation, Brinley&#39;s gaze darted toward Vincent again. &#34;Vincent, you have to trust me. I didn&#39;t do any of 计！＂	~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Vincent&#39;s forehead creased. After a long breath, he placed a gentle hand on Brinley&#39;s shoulder, offering silent reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That small comfort seemed to settle Brinley, who stopped resisting as the cuffs were finally secured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the officers escorted her out, Brinley kept twisting around, eyes clinging to Vincent for some sign he would intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without delay, Danica gave Vincent a sharp nudge.&#34;Don&#39;t just stand there, Vincent. Go after her! There&#39;sno way this isn&#39;t all a mistake. Brinley needs you-look at her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent had just taken a step forward when a cold, scornful laugh escaped from Hannah. His jaw clenched as he paused for a moment. Then, without another word, he walked quickly after Brinley.</p>
