                <p>&#34;We still don&#39;t have all the facts,&#34; Vincent said with a frown, his voice turning even colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica grew restless. &#34;Vincent, how can you say that? Brinley&#39;s already dug up so much evidence. Hannah did this to her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent stayed calm,replying,&#34;1was the one who&#39;d picked Brinley up that day. At that time, Hannah was still in the hospital. How would she have pulled this off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s expression faltered for a brief moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica muttered, &#34;She must have arranged everything ahead of time. She could have hired those men long before. She didn&#39;t need to be there in person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of cold swept through Hannah. Danica&#39;s dislike for her really ran deep. Looking back at how desperately she once tried to earn Danica&#39;s approval, she saw now what a waste it had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Vincent, Hannah was surprised. She never expected him to intervene, much less defend her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley pressed her lips together, tears welling up again. &#34;Vincent, when I first found out about this 1doubted it too. I struggled to believe Hannah would go so far.&#34; Tears streamed down her cheeks, every look crafted for sympathy. &#34;But I have proof-a recording. The two men even mentioned her name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley took out her phone and played the audio for everyone to hear. &#34;The client? Yeah, it was that woman,Hannah... Hannah Scott or something. She said we could do anything to Brinley and promised a big bonus when it was over. Brinley was a reaI looker, smooth skin, tiny waist, any man would want to...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley hastily stopped the recording, visibly flustered. She looked at Hannah with shaking eyes. &#34;I know you never liked me, and you hated that I came to the Jones house. But I never imagined you&#39;d try to hurt me like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica kept rubbing Brinley&#39;s back in a show of comfort, while Vincent tapped his fingers on the table, his face impossible to read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah could barely stop herself from laughing. &#34;That&#39;s your so-called proof? Getting two guys to say my name in a recording? What exactly does that prove? And if I had actually hired them, do you think I&#39;d have been dumb enough to use my real name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley flinched but quickly recovered with a wounded sigh. &#34;Hannah, I only want an apology. But after everything we&#39;ve shown, you don&#39;t even seem a bit sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah folded her arms, her tone unwavering. &#34;Why should I apologize for something I didn&#39;t do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh tears sparkled in Brinley&#39;s eyes. &#34;Then explain why your phone has a video of me being harassed by those men at the club?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s eyebrows drew together in confusion. A heavy feeling of dread settled in her stomach.&#34;What are you even talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Hannah could react, Danica stepped forward and snatched Hannah&#39;s phone out of her grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley wasted no time. She opened the photo album, found a video, played it, and shoved the screen in front of Hannah. &#34;Are you still going to claim you had nothing to do with this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s desperate screams echoed from the phone speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah stared at the unfamiliar video playing on her own device. Then, it hit her-just yesterday, Brinley had visited her room, supposedly to discuss plans for Sharon&#39;s birthday. Right in the middle of their talk, Danica had called her downstairs. She had left her phone behind. That must have been when Brinley made her move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s fists tightened with anger. Brinley must have realized the audio was not enough, so she planted this video as backup-now she was pressing her advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica pounced right away. &#34;What now? You&#39;re out of excuses. Say sorry to Brinley. Right noW.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah lifted her head, her eyes steady. &#34;If there&#39;s a video, why stop at apologies? Let&#39;s get the police involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s face twisted in outrage. She clutched her forehead.&#34;Have you lost it? Dragging this to the police-what does that do for the Jones family?&#34; She shook Vincent&#39;s arm, growing frantic. &#34;Vincent, are you just going to let her do as she pleases? Do you really want to involve the police?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley didn&#39;t want to involve the police either. Her eyes welled up as she turned to Vincent. &#34;Vincent, I&#39;m not asking for much. I just want Hannah to apologize. That&#39;s it. The police won&#39;t fix anything.It&#39;ll only reopen my wounds and make me relive it all over again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah couldn&#39;t stand another moment of Brinley&#39;s theatrics in front of Vincent. She grabbed the phone back from Brinley&#39;s grasp.&#34;You want an apology? Let&#39;s see what the police think. By the time this is finished, you might owe me an apology.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started to dial, but Vincent moved fast and blocked the screen with his hand.&#34;We&#39;re not involving the police,&#34; he said, voice flat and final.</p>
