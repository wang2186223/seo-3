                <p>Felix leaned back, arms folded with a glint of defiance in his eyes. &#34;Let me tell you something.When a woman gets hurt, she rarely looks back.Besides, Hannah told me herself she&#39;s divorced.I trust her word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow crossed Vincent&#39;s features. He touched his wedding ring, twisting it absentmindedly, before letting out a short, humorless laugh. &#34;Just a normal fight between husband and wife. Couples argue all the time.How could you fall for her angry words?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sometimes, a small argument is just the start. You&#39;d be surprised how quickly things turn permanent,&#34;Felix retorted, a smirk tugging at his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent fixed him with an indifferent stare. &#34;That&#39;s never happening.&#34; Without another glance,he swung open the car door and slid into the backseat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the Bentley, Hannah sat perfectly still,feigning asleep as the world outside faded to murmurs. Every word had slipped through the car window and settled in her chest. Was that really all Vincent thought this was? Just another argument? Did he honestly think their divorce was somne empty threat? Clearly, every sign of their failing marriage had escaped him. If he cared at all, he would have noticed the cracks that had split their lives apart ages ago-fractures that no amount of time could fix. There was no path left for them but divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent glanced over at Hannah, her forehead pressed to the window, and inched a bit closer.He tried to sound casual. &#34;So, how do you know Felix?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah kept her eyes shut, refusing to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation crept into his voice. &#34;Hannah. I&#39;m speaking to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her eyes closed. &#34;All this talking is giving me a headache.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For good measure, she added, &#34;And I don&#39;t need any more noise right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No part of her wanted to engage. Letting her head drift toward the window, she tried to edge herself as far from him as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A muscle worked in Vincent&#39;s jaw, his patience wearing thin as his eyes darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody spoke. An uneasy hush filled the car, thick enough to suffocate. From the driver&#39;s seat, Derek stared straight ahead, careful not to breathe too loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their arrival at the hospital was brisk and silent.Vincent wasted no time getting Hannah checked in with one of the top neurologists, suspecting that her dizziness might be due to a mild concussion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Testing finished quickly, and the doctor pronounced her mostly fine. He suggested she rest and ordered a round of IV fluids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long after the doctor&#39;s footsteps faded, Vincent remained rooted by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A casual tone colored her question. &#34;You don&#39;t have anything to take care of at work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll leave once your IV finishes,&#34; Vincent replied, his attention locked onto his phone as he scrolled through the latest contract his secretary had sent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shoulders lifting in a shrug, she replied, &#34;Do as you please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of curiosity made her steal a look at him.Every line of his face looked perfectly carved,and that small mole under his left eye caught the light.Someone once told her a mark like that belonged to someone with a cold soul. Focused as ever, he read his phone, the overhead lights framing his silhouette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been watching me,&#34; Vincent remarked, lifting a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you noticed, you must have been watching me too,&#34; she shot back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s eyes lit up. Just for a moment, it felt like old times-back when Hannah had been chasing after With a chuckle, he leaned in, lowering his voice.&#34;No matter what you say, I could feel your eyes on me for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something tender in his eyes as he gazed at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Between them, the mood shifted, drawing them together in a silent, magnetic pull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His crisp cologne floated between them, and she instinctively turned her face away from him. No matter how he looked at her, shestill felt like he was seeing someone else through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, the sharp ring of his phone broke the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Vincent let it ring, pretending not to hear.Hannah nudged him lightly. &#34;You should answer that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice came out low. &#34;Let it ring.&#34; He leaned closer, hoping to kiss her, as if the world outside could wait.  Her patience ran out. &#34;Pick up, Vincent. It could be urgent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t stomach being kissed by him, especially after his betrayal. Her body tensed, every nerve screaming resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy sigh, Vincent finally took the call. His features turned all business upon hearing whatever the other end of the line had said. &#34;I&#39;ll be there right away,&#34; he said before ending the call without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something&#39;s happened at work. I have to leave.&#34; He grabbed his coat, already halfway out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; she replied, barely above a whisper. This wasn&#39;t new to her. She was used to it by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let Derek take you home once you&#39;re finished here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short nod was all she gave. &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent rattled off a handful of instructions and walked off, carrying the look of someone with pressing matters waiting on him.</p>
