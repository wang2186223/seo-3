                <p>Back at the hospital, Hannah decided to steer the conversation away from Vincent and began talking about her work instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News that Hannah actually held a job brought a flicker of relief to her parents. Curious and a bit anxious, they started peppering her with questions about her daily routine and responsibilities. Bit by bit,their faces softened-at least the rumors of unemployment weren&#39;t true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Margaret gently circled back to the issue that troubled her most. &#34;Even so, Hannah,your father and I need to meet your husband at some point,&#34; she insisted. She couldn&#39;t rest easy until she&#39;d seen her son-in-law in person, especially after everything people had said about their daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice low and uncertain, Hannah said,&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Raymond&#39;s IV finished, he wasted no time insisting on being discharged. The heavy scent of antiseptic in the hospital made him restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since there was no convincing him to change his mind, Hannah had no other option but to finish filling out the discharge forms. Rather than return to the Jones estate and risk an awkward encounter with Danica, she brought her parents back to her place at Sterling Heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stack of delivery boxes greeted them outside Unit 2201.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret eyed the packages and asked, &#34;Has it been a while since you came home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I haven&#39;t been back much lately,&#34; Hannah replied, her words guarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raymond took in the fresh look of the apartment, his skepticism clear. &#34;Everything here looks untouched.Do you and Vincent actually stay here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calmly, Hannah lied, &#34;We moved back to the Jones estate recently. Vincent bought this apartment as an investment, but it&#39;s under my name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to reassure them, she added, &#34;There&#39;s really no reason to doubt me. I&#39;m married to Vincent.He&#39;s... He&#39;s been quite generous with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll see for ourselves when he finally shows up.&#34;Raymond remained unswayed, his voice firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle nudge from Margaret and a warning look urged him to stop, but he just shrugged. &#34;I didn&#39;t say anything wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret could only roll her eyes in mild exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Hannah&#39;s phone lit up. It was Sharon. A moment&#39;s hesitation passed before she answered.&#34;Hello? Sharon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognizing the name on the call, Margaret and Raymond exchanged a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hannah, it&#39;s getting late. Why aren&#39;t you back yet?&#34;Sharon&#39;s voice filtered through the phone, concern clear as day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Hannah glance at the clock. Ten o&#39;clock had crept up on her. Normally, she would have called Sharon to explain if she planned to miss dinner. A quick apology slipped from her lips. &#34;Sorry,Sharon. I forgot to let you know, I won&#39;t be home tonight. My parents are visiting, and I&#39;d like to spend a few days showing them around Dorbarrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That news caught Sharon off guard. &#34;Your parents are here? That&#39;s wonderful!&#34; Her tone grew more serious. &#34;In that case, bring them over tomorrow,Hannah. I&#39;ll arrange a proper dinner so we can welcome them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle refusal from Hannah followed. &#34;Thank you,but it&#39;s alright. I&#39;ll handle things myself. My parents are only here for a short while before they head home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raymond,unable to sit by any longer, reached for the phone before Hannah could react. &#34;Hello, is this Ms.Sharon Jones? I&#39;m Hannah&#39;s father, Raymond Scott.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon&#39;s reply was gracious. &#34;Hello, Mr. Scott. I haven&#39;t been feeling well and haven&#39;t had the chance to visit. But now that you&#39;re in town, I&#39;d love to host a meal for you and your wife. Would you be available tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of hope brightened Raymond&#39;s face. &#34;That sounds perfect! We&#39;ve been wanting to meet our in-laws for a long time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah made a move to reclaim her phone, but Margaret quickly stepped in to hold her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eager to cement the invitation, Raymond continued,&#34;It would mean a lot for my wife and me to finally meet Vincent. Would tomorrow work for everyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth and a hint of curiosity colored Sharon&#39;s response. &#34;We&#39;d be delighted to have you. Although,isn&#39;t Vincent with you right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raymond answered honestly, &#34;No, unfortunately not.Hannah mentioned he was busy with work, so we haven&#39;t seen him yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief pause stretched over the line before Sharon spoke, her voice now edged with purpose.&#34;Thank you for letting me know. Let&#39;s settle it-tomorrow at noon, come to the Jones family estate. We&#39;ll have lunch together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s wonderful,&#34; Raymond said, his mood visibly lifted as he ended the call. A weight lifted from his shoulders, he finally felt reassured-at least for now,those ugly rumors about his daughter being a mistress had lost their hold.</p>
