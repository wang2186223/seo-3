                <p>Hannah turned with a cold stare as the voice cut through the air. A pack of well-dressed young men strolled over, each one flanked by a woman clinging to his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out in front walked Issac Stanley, a face Hannah instantly recognized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Issac carried a reputation for arrogance and lack of manners, and it was he who had recently embarrassed Hannah in public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Issac&#39;s gaze flicked to Felix as he taunted, &#34;So,Hannah, this is your new benefactor? He doesn&#39;t seem impressive at all.&#34; He followed that up with a mocking laugh. &#34;What&#39;s this about? After leaving Vincent, this is all you could snag?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter broke out among his friends, their amusement echoing behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The insult stung, and Felix&#39;s brow furrowed as he moved forward, but Hannah quietly caught his arm to hold him back. She saw this as her own battle and didn&#39;t need Felix to fight for her. She could handle it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spreading rumors and gossiping behind people&#39;s backs had always been these people&#39;s favorite pastime, and she had heard much worse over the years. Now, such words didn&#39;t faze her in the slightest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing her ground, Hannah locked eyes with Issac.&#34;Mr. Stanley, it&#39;s been some time. I heard your stepmother is about to bring a baby into this world soon.Congratulations on becoming a big brother!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew exactly where to hit, thanks to Rena&#39;s tip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rena, fed up with how these spoiled heirs mistreated Hannah, had quietly given her the inside scoop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Issac&#39;s biological mother had passed away early,leaving his father to remarry. Now, with a new sibling on the way and no position in the family business,Issac&#39;s pride was on shaky ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scowl darkened Issac&#39;s features. &#34;So you&#39;ve been investigating around about me?&#34; He stepped in closer, voice dripping with contempt. &#34;I get it now.You&#39;re after me next, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To his mind, if she wanted him as a backer, she should have made her move instead of playing games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within their social circle, there were even bets on when Vincent would toss Hannah aside, and who would get to claim her next. It wasn&#39;t about love. It was all about her looks and the thrill of getting laid with her.Each man in the group eyed her with hungry interest, hoping to be the one to keep her around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah only responded with a cold smirk and an exasperated roll of her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Issac let his eyes wander over her, making no effort to hide it. He dropped his date&#39;s hand right away. &#34;In that case, here&#39;s my offer. Serve me for a month, and I&#39;ll pay you this much.&#34; With a smug grin, he flashed a single finger, signaling the amount.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah fixed him with a look of pure disdain. &#34;Really,Mr. Stanley? Are you this stingy even when hiring a housekeeper?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bristled. &#34;Who said anything about a housèkeeper? And you think a million isn&#39;t enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shrug was all she gave. &#34;I don&#39;t think I have misunderstood anything. For Vincent, a million is spare change.&#34; Her hand shot up&#39;to her lips as a thought seemed to dawn on her. &#34;Oh, that&#39;s right.There&#39;s no way your family can measure up to the Jones family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Issac&#39;s cheeks flamed with fury. &#34;You-&#34; He faltered,clenching his fists. &#34;In the end, Vincent still dumped you. How could you still parade around with that attitude?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guess I need to spell it out for you.&#34; Disdain laced her words as she met his gaze. &#34;When you don&#39;t have the means, Mr. Stanley, don&#39;t entertain the idea of keeping a woman around. It&#39;s humiliating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gathered crowd erupted in laughter, unable to contain themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shame flooding his face, Issac lunged toward Hannah, intent on making her pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix was there in an instant, stepping between them,his eyes flashing a clear warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah didn&#39;t hesitate to whip out her phone and snap a flurry of photos aimed at Issac and his crew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly grin spread across her face as she stepped out from behind Felix, holding her phone high in the air.&#34;Mr. Stanley, if I were you, I&#39;d gather up your friends and your date and leave right now. Otherwise, these photos are going straight to the internet. Imagine the scandal-keeping women on the side and stirring up drama in public. Your reputations won&#39;t recover.Think about your father, Mr. Stanley. If he catches wind of this, you&#39;ll only give him more reason to dote on your unborn brother instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic washed over Issac, draining the color from his face, and his companions hurried to drag him away before things got worse. They knew better than to take her threats lightly. One by one, they made their exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix watched Hannah with concern. This wasn&#39;t the first time she&#39;d faced such insults and slander.&#34;Getting a divorce is for the best,&#34; he said, giving her a gentle look.</p>
