                <p>Chapters of their marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Painful as it was, Hannah pressed on, for her parents&#39;sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere between desperation and resignation,the call finally connected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s voice on the other end let Hannah release a shaky sigh of relief. &#34;Vincent, when are you coming back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence lingered on the line, a drawn-out pause that made Hannah&#39;s nerves stretch thin. It sounded as though Vincent was checking his surroundings before finally responding, &#34;Probably three days.What&#39;s the matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted and answered, &#34;My parents-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, another voice floated through the phone,unmistakably Brinley&#39;s. &#34;Vincent, give this a try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything inside Hannah turned to ice. Numb realization settled over her. No business trip had taken him overseas-he was on vacation, basking in Brinley&#39;s affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy, painful silence followed. Not even the static offered comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Vincent&#39;s voice came through again. &#34;You were saying about your parents?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An edge crept into Hannah&#39;s reply. &#34;It&#39;s nothìng important. They just sent me some local specialties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered only a vague sound of acknowledgment, his thoughts already drifting away. His voice was low.&#34;Anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated for a moment, still holding onto a shred of hope. &#34;It&#39;s just... Would you mind talking to my parents-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Hannah could finish, the call disconnected,cutting her off mid-sentence. Through the crackle of the dead line, Brinley&#39;s voice carried faintly, calling Vincent&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Familiar disappointment wrapped around Hannah&#39;s heart. She&#39;d seen this pattern so many timnes, but the sting never faded. For a fleeting moment, when Vincent answered, she&#39;d believed he might actually help her, play along for her parents&#39; sake. Anything to keep them from worrying in their old age. Reality however, showed no mercy. Vincent was somewhere far away, wrapped up in a new romance, oblivious to the promises he&#39;d made her long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing in the hallway, Hannah watched her parents through the hospital door, self-blame weighing her down like a heavy blanket. Fully grown, and yet sheDetermined not to let them see her falter, she composed herself and strode back into the room,wearing a bright, practiced smile. &#34;I told you-he&#39;s really busy. He&#39;s away on business right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hope faded instantly from their faces, replaced by shadow and worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep sadness etched itself across Margaret&#39;s features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raymond kept his gaze locked on Hannah, silent at first. After a moment, he released a heavy sigh.&#34;I just hope you haven&#39;t lied to yourself so long that you actually believe it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret&#39;s voice trembled with sadness. &#34;Tell me,Hannah, if this marriage is real, what kind of son-in-law avoids his in-laws for five whole years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No words came to Hannah. The truth was too bitter to share, and she knew that without meeting Vincent,her parents would never believe her. Explaining that her husband&#39;s heart belonged to someone else would only deepen their worry and heartbreak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sting of their disappointment made it hard for Hannah to even draw breath. &#34;He&#39;ll visit once his work settles down,&#34; she replied, forcing a smile that felt brittle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thousands of miles away in Calveria, Brinley touched Vincent&#39;s arm gently. &#34;Vincent, the people you&#39;re meeting have arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent had taken a red-eye flight on his private jet to Calveria after receiving an urgent acquisition proposal the night before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley had insisted on joining him, claiming a change of scenery would lift the weight from her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before agreeing, Vincent had checked with her doctors-travel, they assured him, could be good for her heart. Besides, it suited him to put some distance between himself and Hannah-she&#39;d been acting up a lot lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What surprised him was how quickly her calls and texts started pouring in as soon as he left. A subtle smirk crossed his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley, noticing the faint curve of his lips, asked with curiosity, &#34;What is it, Vincent? Did the deal meet your expectations?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s response was smooth, but his satisfaction was clear. &#34;Nothing.&#34; All those texts. All those calls.Hannah was clearly rattled. He knew it-she cared about him deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fastening his cufflinks, Vincent stepped into the meeting room with unshakeable confidence. Minutes later, he&#39;d dissected the acquisition proposal,exposed glaring issues, and secured an extra three percent profit for the company with sharp, decisive tactics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plans shifted quickly after the meeting. Brinley,watching the pace pick up, wondered if Vincent was just eager to have more free time with her. She asked softly, &#34;I thought we&#39;d stay for three days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunlight poured in through the towering windows as Vincent considered her words. A faint, mysterious smile played on his lips. &#34;I want to head back sooner,&#34; he answered.</p>
