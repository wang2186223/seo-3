                <p>Lately, Vincent&#39;s late nights at the office had become routine, barely making it back home to rest. This was nothing new to Hannah. She&#39;d grown accustomed to his absence due to work-related stuff years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the next two nights, Hannah poured her energy into perfecting every detail of Sharon&#39;s upcoming birthday celebration. Drawing on a sense of nostalgia, she passed on Brinley&#39;s suggestions for lavish hotels and castle venues, opting instead to transform the Jones family estate into something magical. She didn&#39;t stop there. A carefully worded email went out to Sharon&#39;s favorite classicaI orchestra. Booking such a renowned ensemble was no small feat, but she figured it was worth a shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the company had already pulled every flawed product from the shelves. With that hurdle cleared, her sights shifted to a new mission-developing a new line of women&#39;s personal safety devices. For her, nothing outranked the product development. Only by launching something reliable and innovative could she have the confidence to revisit the idea of collaborating with Miles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long before, her sonic earring design had become a national sensation, blending style with security. Their success had faded, though, as trends shifted and competitors multiplied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she brought every top mind in the company together, building a single powerhouse team focused entirely on the new product launch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most days found Hannah at her desk from sunrise until long after dark. Immersing herself in work was more than a habit. It was the only way to drown out everything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Late one evening, she finally returned home, just as the clock struck ten. A message blinked on her phone from the private detective-he had located the two men and paid them to speak the truth. He sent her a recording. She returned to her room, closed the door, and listened to it. Just as she had expected, both men confessed they had been hired by Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah immediately texted him back. &#34;Turn them over to the Dorbarrow police.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in thought, she suddenly felt a presence at the doorway of her room and looked over. Beside the wide open door, Brinley stood there, arms folded and eyes glinting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The banquet&#39;s only days away, and you&#39;re still scrolling on your phone?&#34; Brinley taunted, her voice thick with disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance flickered across Hannah&#39;s face. &#34;Hasn&#39;t anyone ever told you to knock before walking into someone else&#39;s room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A roll of her eyes was Brinley&#39;s only answer. &#34;Why bother? Once I marry into this family, I&#39;ll have the run of the place. Doors won&#39;t matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah met her gaze with a soft, unbothered laugh.&#34;Do not get ahead of yourself just yet. Last | checked,the title of Mrs. Jones still belongs to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Jones?&#34; Brinley&#39;s laughter rang out, her gaze full of scorn.&#34;Do you actually believe you deserve that title? Vincent&#39;s been married to you for five years and has never once acknowledged you publicly, like you&#39;re just some mistress he tucked away. Not a soul sees you as his rightful wife. How pathetic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five years of being labeled as the&#34;mistress&#34; while she was actually Vincent&#39;s rightful wife had dulled the sting for Hannah. Brinley&#39;s barbs rolled right off; only someone naïve would think they could still wound her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A calm reply slipped from Hannah&#39;s lips. &#34;Pathetic? Look in the mirror, Brinley. You throw tantrums and spin little plots, but after all that effort, you&#39;re still standing on the sidelines. No wonder you&#39;re obsessed with pestering me, Vincent&#39;s real wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Color crept up Brinley&#39;s cheeks, though she smoothed her expression and flashed a smug grm.&#34;Here&#39;s something you might not know: Vincent just handed me the reins of one of the Jones Group&#39;s subsidiaries. Even gave me an apartment nearby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley paused to admire her flawless nails, smirking. &#34;Meanwhile, what have you gotten in your five years as Mrs. Jones? He doesn&#39;t love you, and he sure doesn&#39;t appreciate your abilities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Hannah had endured so much, hearing thnat Vincent gifted Brinley a whole business made her chest tighten for a moment. He&#39;d told her she didn&#39;t need a job, only to turn around and ggive Brinley an entire company. That old ache was quickly pushed aside-after all, divorce was on the horizon, and none of it really mattered anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Composure returned to Hannah&#39;s face as she met Brinley&#39;s gaze. &#34;It seems Vincent&#39;s been quite generous with you. All the more reason for you not to mess with me. If you push me too far, that shiny company and apartment might slip right through your fingers. So you&#39;d better tread carefully around me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An eye roll was Brinley&#39;s answer. &#34;Since when did you get to dedicate the company and apartment Vincent had offered me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matter-of-factly, Hannah replied, &#34;They&#39;re part of the marital assets I share with Vincent. So yes,they absolutely concern me. If I decide I want them back, I have every right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sneer curled Brinley&#39;s lips. &#34;You&#39;re heading for a divorce. What marital assets?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter bubbled out of Hannah. &#34;That divorce agreement is still in my hands. Whether we split or not depends on my say-so. I&#39;m the one in control, Brinley. Feel free to test me-see if I will kick you out of that apartment.&#34;</p>
