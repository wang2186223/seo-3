                <p>&#34;I meant it might be smarter to let a real party planner handle the celebration. I&#39;d probably just mess it up,&#34; Hannah explained, her tone flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension on Vincent&#39;s expression eased a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah curled her lips into a slight smile and added,&#34;But if you want to divorce me and marry someone else, I won&#39;t stand in your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent tugged at his tie, a cold smirk spreading across his lips. &#34;You really want me to marry someone else? Are you eager to ditch me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While keeping her eyes fixed on the window, Hannah answered with zero hesitation, &#34;Of course. I got tired of seeing your face every day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Vincent leaned in, his crisp, masculine scent wafting into her nostrils. His voice dropped to a whisper. &#34;So what&#39;s wrong with my face, exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah turned her head, only to find his chiseled features dangerously close. Her lashes fluttered,and her heart thudded in her chest. He&#39;d always been ridiculously handsome. That was why she&#39;d chased after him all those years ago. He never bothered with fancy cologne. Somehow, he always smelled crisp and magnetic, without even trying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thick silence pressed between them, heavy as a rainstorm. Vincent eventually made a low humming sound, urging her for an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Hannah reached up and nudged his face aside. &#34;Even the best-looking guy starts to look the same after seeing every single day for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow passed over Vincent&#39;s face, the mood in the car sinking a few degrees. &#34;You really want to get on my nerves, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curled into a half-smile. &#34;I&#39;m just saying what&#39;s on my mind. You&#39;re way better at irritating people than Iam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one spoke for a few seconds, and the atmosphere was thick enough to cut. Up front, Derek Barrett,Vincent&#39;s assistant, shrank back in his seat,wishing he could disappear altogether.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, Vincent circled back. &#34;Grandma&#39;s turning seventy. The birthday party is your responsibility.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s first instinct was to refuse. They were getting divorced-keeping their distance would be best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she started to voice her refusal, Vincent jumped in first. &#34;She adores you. You really want to let her down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit like a brick. From the moment Hannah married into the Jones family, Sharon had always offered the gentlest welcome. Whenever Danica&#39;s words stung or Vincent seemed to vanish from her world, it was Sharon who stood by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, Sharon&#39;s strength was fading, age catching up with her in small,quiet ways. Hannah had always</p>
                
                
                
                <p>intended to wait until this birthday passed before bringing up the divorce. Most likely, this would be their last celebration together. So why was she still second-guessing herself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A breath escaped her lips as she answered, &#34;Fine.I&#39;ll do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief softened Vincent&#39;s sharp features. &#34;That settles it. Starting now, we&#39;ll move back to the Jones family house. Everything you need will be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Hannah replied, her voice flat as stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sidelong glance, Vincent studied her profile,something unshakable gnawing at his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the ride passed in silence as the Bentley cruised toward the Jones family estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A solitary figure stood by the iron gates,waiting with apparent purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of Brinley through the car window,Hannah&#39;s heart dropped. She turned to Vincent, her words clipped and cold. &#34;You should have mentioned</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley was here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up on her irritation right away and rushed to calm the moment.&#34;She won&#39;t be around long. It&#39;s only temporary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nod was all he received. Hannah wasted no energy arguing as she stepped out of the car. Last time she and Brinley spoke, things had turned sour fast. But this was the Jones house. Danica and Vincent had agreed to let Brinley stay, and her feelings on the matter meant nothing here. Planning the birthday was her only reason for being back. Whether Brinley left or stayed changed nothing about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s expression flickered when she saw Hannah.&#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah let out a dry, derisive laugh. &#34;Miss Gilbert,you&#39;ve been living here so long that you almost believe you&#39;re the lady of the manor? That question should be coming from me-Vincent&#39;s actual wvife.&#34;</p>
