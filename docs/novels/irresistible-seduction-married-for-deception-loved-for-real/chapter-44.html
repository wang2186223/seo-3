                <p>Vincent&#39;s eyes bore into Hannah, their intensity impossible to ignore. Derek had made it very clear over the phone-Brinley&#39;s harassment was somehow connected to Hannah. With the truth now on the table, there was no escaping the expectation-an apology was required.The Jones family prided itself on being just.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion washed over Hannah. &#34;Did I hear you right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Vincent ordered, &#34;Apologize to Brinley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick spark of satisfaction lit up Brinley&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica couldn&#39;t hide her delight either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You actually doubt me?&#34; Hannah&#39;s laugh was brittle. &#34;You seriously think I leaked that video to the press?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unblinking, Vincent held her gaze. &#34;This isn&#39;t only about the video. You owe her for what had happened at the club as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing tall behind Vincent, Brinley practicaly radiated victory. For her, Vincent&#39;s loyalty was a given.Now,he was proving it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain seized Hannah&#39;s chest, and color drained from her cheeks. His accusations left deep marks, sharper than she expected. She had thought she&#39;d built up enough scars to stop caring. Even so, Vincent&#39;s defense of Brinley still left her reeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after a long pause did Hannah find her voice again, quiet but determined. &#34;Suppose I refuse. Then what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disbelief crept into Vincent&#39;s voice. &#34;You won&#39;t even admit to your own doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s voice was cold as she met his stare.&#34;My own doing? You&#39;re already convinced I&#39;m guilty without hearing my side of the story. I didn&#39;t do anything. And I won&#39;t admit to something I didn&#39;t do.&#34; Admitting to a crime she never committed made no sense at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indifference filled Vincent&#39;s voice. &#34;Derek has already investigated. Everything that had happened to Brinley at the club points straight to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than defend herself any further, Hannah simply turned away and gave a low, humorless laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration broke through Danica&#39;s composure. &#34;See for yourself, Vincent. Hannah won&#39;t even pretend to feel sorry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension in the air pressed in. With a gentle touch, Brinley reached for Vincent&#39;s sleeve, her words meant to solidify her gentle and forgiving image.&#34;Please, Vincent, there&#39;s no need to argue. Let&#39;s let this go. I&#39;m not holding a grudge, now that everyone knows the truth. I just hope Hannah won&#39;t treat me like this again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s scowl eased slightly. Brinley was always so understanding. Yet, the moment his eyes found Hannah again, they met nothing but quiet resistance. Firmness crept into his words. &#34;No. I&#39;m not letting this go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For him,this was not an issue they could just brush aside. Hannah had to admit she was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica seized the moment.&#34;Exactly.Hannah owes Brinley an apology.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A harsh laugh escaped Hannah. &#34;There&#39;s nothing for me to apologize for. If anyone should apologize, it&#39;s Brinley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lines of frustration appeared on Vincent&#39;s forehead. &#34;Since when had you become like this?&#34; He remembered a time when Hannah would own up to her mistakes. In his eyes, she had changed. Where was the woman who used to make things right after making some errors?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s gaze turned colder, sharper than before. Just like always, the moment she fell short of what he wanted, he dragged the past into the room and threw it in her face. &#34;Nothing about me has changed. If you can&#39;t stand the person I am, then go ahead and divorce me. That way, you can finally be with your precious Brinley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dangerous glint flickered in Vincent&#39;s eyes as his jaw tensed, signaling the storm inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, a piercing siren echoed from the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Into the room rushed a maid, breathless and wide-eyed. &#34;Mr. Jones, the police are at thefront door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A muscle in Vincent&#39;s jaw twitched as he shifted his gaze toward the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement bubbled beneath Brinley&#39;s composed exterior. The police had made their entrance sooner than she&#39;d hoped. Now Hannah had nowhere left to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning panic, Brinley clung to Vincent&#39;s arm. &#34;Vincent, what should we do? I saw the video online and panicked. That&#39;s why I called the police. But now I&#39;m worried... What if they arrest Hannah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica scoffed. &#34;Why are you being so soft-hearted, Brinley? Let the police do their job. If Hannah gets locked up, it serves her right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent cast a look Hannah&#39;s way. Her composure held firm-she showed not the slightest hint of fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, the officers followed the maid into the foyer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley wasted no time stepping forward, voice trembling, eyes shining with practiced regret. &#34;Officers, I&#39;m so sorry. I want to take back my complaint. We settled everything. It was all a big misunderstanding. Please don&#39;t take Hannah away. I never meant for it to go this far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears hovered on her lashes, her words quivering as if heartbreak weighed on her. Anyone watching might have believed Brinley and Hannah were lifelong friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the police stayed detached. &#34;Ma&#39;am, please don&#39;t disrupt official proceedings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One officer moved to the front. &#34;We need to speak with Hannah Scott. Is she here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Hannah could utter a word, Vincent reached over and stopped her. Standing tall, he introduced himself. &#34;I&#39;m:her husband. If you have questions, direct them to me.&#34;</p>
