            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Spotting Vincent and Brinley just a few steps away, Hannah snapped to full alert. Any trace of drowsiness vanished, even though her brain was still catching up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clive&#39;s jaw threatened to drop in shock. His boss&#39;s kept woman was in another man&#39;s office? He couldn&#39;t wrap his head around it. So, Hannah hadn&#39;t been dumped yet?She must have more cunning than he&#39;d given her credit for. Scorn twisted in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Brinley couldn&#39;t hide her astonishment at Hannah&#39;s appearance. In that instant, it dawned on her why Felix&#39;s face had seemed so familiar. Her memory brought back the image of him sitting with Hannah at Chance Cafe. Clearly, their connection ran deeper than she&#39;d realized. But what was really going on between them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinct drew Brinley&#39;s attention to Vincent. His face made everything clear-he was seething. His glare at Hannah could have frozen stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley immediately understood. Vincent&#39;s ego was wounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one dared to break the suffocating silence that filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a relaxed smile, Felix closed the distance between him and Hannah.&#34;Did we wake you up? Why not sleep a bit longer?&#34; he said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Checking the time on her phone, Hannah realized it was almost four o&#39;clock. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you wake me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle grin lingered on Felix&#39;s face. &#34;I figured you deserved a little more sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She regarded Vincent and Brinley with a cool stare and asked, &#34;They&#39;re here for Nova Tech?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix kept his gaze steady on her. &#34;That&#39;s right. They&#39;re here hoping to buy the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any warmth vanished from Hannah&#39;s features as the reality hit. So Vincent was aiming for Nova Tech now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension sliced through Vincent&#39;s voice as he spoke, lips pressed into a thin line. &#34;Come over here. Now.&#34;Every word landed like a slap of winter air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single step did Hannah take. She simply gave him a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hard knot formed in Vincent&#39;s chest. Damn it. His mother had been right all along. Hannah had rushed out early this morning just to meet this guy. On top of everything, she&#39;d actually sleep in this guy&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter laugh burst from Vincent as he crossed the space between them in quick, forceful steps. His hand seized Hannah&#39;s wrist, attempting to yank her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go of me!&#34; Hannah exclaimed, twisting against him, but his grip refused to loosen. Angry red marks sprang up on her skin almost immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Felix moved in, securing Hannah&#39;s other arm. His eyes narrowed with challenge.&#34;Mr. Jones, care to explain exactly what you&#39;re doing right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s gaze grew icier as he let out a short, mocking laugh. &#34;Why would I owe you any sort of explanation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not backing down, Felix&#39;s tone grew firmer. &#34;Dragging my woman out of here absolutely demands an explanation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hushed silence blanketed the office. All attention focused on Felix.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s eyes widened in shock. Felix had feelings for Hannah? If that was the case, their negotiation just got a whole lot trickier. No acquisition would go smoothly with feelings tangled up like this. There was no telling what influence Hannah might wield over Felix.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Felix immediately came to Hannah&#39;s defense filled Brinley with scorn. Hannah was really something else-after falling out with Vincent, she wasted no time jumping into another man&#39;s armns. Yet, did Felix understand he might be nothing more than Hannah&#39;s consolation prize?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes slanting in calculation, Brinley spoke up, her voice smooth. &#34;Vincent, don&#39;t be upset. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s been some kind of misunderstanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent ignored Brinley&#39;s words altogether. A frosty chuckle slipped from him as he tightened his jaw. &#34;You said your woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a gentle but steady tone, Hannah addressed Felix, &#34;Let go,please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah understood Felix&#39;s intention at once-he actually meant business partner, but to keep her role at Nova Tech under wraps and ease her out of the confrontation, he opted for the words &#34;his woman&#34; instead.She didn&#39;t doubt his intentions. His support meant a lot. Even so, she had no wish to drag him into the fallout between herself and Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment&#39;s hesitation, Felix released Hannah&#39;s wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s steady gaze met Vincent&#39;s thunderous glare. She had no intention of causing a scene here, so her words came gently. &#34;If you want to talk, we can do it back at home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An edge crept into Vincent&#39;s voice as he insisted, grip tightening. &#34;Then come home with me now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s voice was quiet, but her resolve didn&#39;t waver. &#34;Vincent, my life is my own. I decide where I go. And right now, I have other priorities-I&#39;m not leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dangerous light flickered in Vincent&#39;s eyes. &#34;Priorities? Is that your way of saying you&#39;re off flirting with another man behind my back?&#34;</p>
