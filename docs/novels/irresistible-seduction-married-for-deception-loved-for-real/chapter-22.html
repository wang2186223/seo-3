                <p>Vincent&#39;s brows drew together as he looked at Hannah.&#34;You told him we&#39;re divorced?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah lowered her gaze, fighting to swallow the bitterness rising in her throat. &#34;I wasn&#39;t wrong.&#34; They were already divorced. He&#39;d signed the divorce agreement without realizing it. It just hadn&#39;t been made public yet. In twenty days, the news would be official.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware that the divorce was real, Vincent scowled.Had Hannah really repeated her angry words from one of their arguments to another man? No wonder Felix had acted so forward. He probably thought she was single.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh really? And why would you say something like that? Is it because you actually like him?&#34; Vincent questioned, a sneer tugging at his mouth. His entire expression turned cold and threatening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What nonsense are you talking about?&#34; Hannah shot up from her seat, shooting Vincent a glare. As a few heads turned their way, she quickly lowered her voice.&#34;Have you lost it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should be the one asking that,&#34; Vincent snapped back, tapping his fingers on the table with growing frustration. &#34;Did you forget you&#39;re still a married woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter laugh slipped from Hannah&#39;s mouth. &#34;That&#39;s rich, coming from you. You don&#39;t exactly behave like a married man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent raised his hand and held it up. The gold band on his ring finger gleamed under the café light.&#34;How don&#39;t I? I wear this every single day.&#34; It was the ring she had picked for him and slipped onto his finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her head away from him, Hannah retorted,&#34;So what? There&#39;s still a line of women throwing themselves at you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s brow tightened. &#34;I&#39;ve said no to every single one of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you didn&#39;t turn Brinley away,&#34; she muttered inwardly instead of saying them out loud. Her breathing grew uneven as she got emotional. A sudden wave of dizziness hit, and her legs gave way beneath her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent moved without hesitation, wrapping an arm around her waist to steady her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix reached out too, but his reaction came just a second too late. He awkwardly pulled his hand back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent placed his hand gently against her forehead.&#34;Still lightheaded?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah batted his hand away. &#34;I don&#39;t need your feigned concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s expression clouded over. Without a word,he firmly pressed her back into the chair. &#34;If you&#39;re not fully recovered, then stop running around like you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really want me to get better?&#34; she retorted.&#34;Then go back to your company.Do it now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent swallowed hard before replying, &#34;There&#39;s no hurry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent looked ready to say more, but Felix quietly stepped in and handed Hannah a cup of water.&#34;Here.Drink this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; A quiet smile passed between them-a gentle, effortless exchange between two people who looked like they belonged in the same frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s eyes narrowed. His voice came out sharp and biting. &#34;Mr. Wade, do you always go out of your way for women who belong to someone else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;Not really. But I doubt l&#39;ve ever gone as far as you have with someone who isn&#39;t your wife.&#34; He hadn&#39;t let go of what he&#39;d seen just days ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent gave a dry laugh and stood. The smile vanished as quickly as it came, replaced by a cold,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>unreadable stare. He wasn&#39;t in the mood to waste words with Felix. He reached down, took hold of Hannah&#39;s wrist, and said, &#34;We&#39;re going back to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; She tried to wriggle her hand free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; He tightened his grip on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| said no.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stood facing each other, neither one backing down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Vincent scooped her into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads turned across the café as every eye locked on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah squirmed, fists landing against his chest with rapid,frustrated blows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her resistance only drew more attention from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent leaned in, his breath brushing her ear.&#34;Keep this up, and I won&#39;t hesitate to kiss you right here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Hannah fell silent. That was exactly the kind of thing he&#39;d follow through on without a second thought.She jerked her face to the side and stopped resisting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent carried her to the car without another word.Felix walked behind them, handing over her bag once she was inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Felix, let&#39;s keep in touch,&#34; she said, her voice low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. Always,&#34; he replied. He gave a small wave and started to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Vincent stopped him. &#34;Thanks,&#34; he said, referring to the help with her things. Then, his tone turned sharp. &#34;And stop thinking she&#39;s up for grabs. I&#39;m not divorcing her. Not now, not ever.&#34;</p>
