                <p>Danica totally misinterpreted Vincent&#39;s polite refusal as concern for Brinley. With a nudge and a cheerful grin, she turned to Brinley. &#34;See? What did I say?Vincent only wants to make sure you aren&#39;t wearing yourself out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This drew a bright smile from Brinley. &#34;It&#39;s no burden at all, Vincent. I actually like doing these little things for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Hannah toyed with her fork, her appetite gone in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reaction didn&#39;t escape Vincent&#39;s notice, but just as he was about to speak up, Danica beat him to it.&#34;Sharon&#39;s 70th birthday is coming up fast. I&#39;ve decided to let Brinley take the lead with the planning this time.&#34; Her tone sparkled, as if she had just shared a fabulous surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Danica&#39;s mind, Hannah and Vincent&#39;s upcoming divorce meant Sharon&#39;s birthday planning was the perfect chance to let Brinley shine. A flawless event would give her an excuse to announce Brinley as her chosen daughter-in-law and set everything in motion for the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confidence radiated from Brinley as she nodded.&#34;Thank you, Mrs. Jones. I&#39;ll make sure Sharon has a birthday she&#39;ll remember for the rest of her life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Vincent, Hannah&#39;s face was shadowed.&#34;Well, since you&#39;ve already picked somneone else for the job, why bother asking me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know until just now,&#34; Vincent said, frowning slightly. He turned to Danica. &#34;Hannah&#39;s handled this every year,and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cutting him off with a dismissive wave, Danica pushed her point. &#34;She&#39;s organized it enough times.Skipping one party isn&#39;t the end of the world. We need a change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calm and steady, Vincent replied, &#34;It&#39;s still Grandma&#39;s birthday. Her granddaughter-in-law should handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica held her position. &#34;Brinley practically grew up under Sharon&#39;s roof. She knows what the family likes.Why shouldn&#39;t she take care of the birthday planning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft, self-effacing smile, Brinley looked down.&#34;Mrs. Jones, perhaps we should let Hannah handle it.I probably am overstepping. After all, I&#39;m just an outsider. Hannah&#39;s much better suited for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a calculated retreat to win support, and Brinley played her part to perfection. Hannah saw through her charade in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single glance from Hannah carried all the cold contempt she felt. &#34;That&#39;s correct. You&#39;re just an outsider, and I am more suited.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her lips pressed tight, Brinley lowered her eyes,pretending to be wounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica wasted no time jumping to Brinley&#39;s defense.&#34;Vincent, can&#39;t you see how upset Brinley is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A note of regret crept into Vincent voice.&#34;That&#39;s not what I meant at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never one to give up,Danica pressed her case &#34;Let&#39;s compromise. Brinley wvill lead the planning,and Hannah can step in as her assistant.Does that sound fair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That sounds perfect,&#34; Brinley chimed in immediately. &#34;I&#39;d love to learn from Hannah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp laugh escaped Hannah. &#34;Absolutely not.Why should I take orders from her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Softening her voice, Brinley tried to appeal to the room.&#34;I&#39;ve been abroad all these  years.Sharon&#39;s  always been kind to me. Now that  I&#39;m back,  I just want to do something nice for her. Hannah,it&#39;s just a  celebration-does it really matter who&#39;s running it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sign of yielding appeared on Hannah&#39;s face.&#34;Either I take charge or I&#39;m out.if you want the spotlight,then own it. If not, don&#39;t bother</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes wet and pleading, Brinley turned to Vincent.allI want is to make Sharon happy. Could you please talk to Hannah for my sak&lt;e?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several long seconds passed before Vincent gave his verdict.&#34;We&#39;ll go with Mom&#39;s suggestion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah snapped,&#34;Excuse me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unruffled, Vincent explained, &#34;This may be Brinley&#39;s only opportunity. You&#39;ll have more chances in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Expression dull, Hannah responded, &#34;I am not on board.&#34; They would soon be divorced, and she didn&#39;t have any more chances. By then, as an ex-wife, her place in this household would be next to nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent closed the discussion. &#34;It&#39;s settled.&#34;</p>
