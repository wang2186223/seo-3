                <p>Catching sight of Vincent blocking the doorway, Hannah&#39;s expression immediately hardened. &#34;That&#39;s not your concern.&#34; With a determined push, she brushed past him, making a beeline for the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm brewed in Vincent&#39;s eyes as he caught her bythe arm and dragged her back, the door thudding shut behind them. His sleeve rolled up, he shot her a pointed look. &#34;You&#39;re not leaving,&#34; he ordered, voice crisp and unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah fixed him with a frosty stare. She paused for a moment before letting out a sharp scoff. &#34;Was it really necessary for you to be this heartless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smirked. What did he expect-was he seriously going to force her to stay in this room and witness his happiness with Brinley? She was hardly interested in watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger flared inside Hannah, each breath coming sharper than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crease appeared between Vincent&#39;s brows as he studied her, frustration clear. Recently, he found himself at a loss every time they spoke. Danica&#39;s presence upstairs with Brinley was the only reason he&#39;d cut his visit short-only to catch Hannah about to slip away. And on top of that, Hannah&#39;s icy tone stung. She wasn&#39;t like this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration made his tone harsh. &#34;You already have full control over the birthday celebration planning. What more do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sharon gave me that responsibility. What does that have to do with you?&#34; Hannah retorted. Brinley was the only one Vincent ever seemed willing to defend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes shining with biting sarcasm, Hannah raised her chin, refusing to back down. &#34;Get out of my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s tone sank lower, rough and tight, like every word had to be forced past his jaw. &#34;I am not moving.Say it. What the hell&#39;s been going on with you these days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah had to suppress an eye roll. Unbelievable. Now he wanted answers, after everything he&#39;d put her through? No reply came. Wasting breath on him felt pointless, every second in this room pressing down on her. All she wanted was to escape.</p>
