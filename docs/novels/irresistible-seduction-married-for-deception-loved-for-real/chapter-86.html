                <p>Across the table, Brinley noticed the quiet standoff between the two men. Her urge to speak was strong, but she kept her questions to herself, wondering why Felix&#39;s face stirred up a sense of familiarity. Even so, none of that could distract her from what really mattered-the acquisition was the only thing on her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, Brinley leaned forward. &#34;Mr. Wade, reports have surfaced about your company heading for bankruptcy. That&#39;s why we&#39;re here to talk about acquiring it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking charge, Vincent casually settled into the seat behind Felix&#39;s desk, giving off an air of authority.&#34;Name your price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small laugh escaped Felix. &#34;Mr. Jones, Nova Tech isn&#39;t exactly a bargain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of responding, Vincent stretched out a hand. Clive, quick on the uptake, placed a folder in his palm.The proposal slid across the desk toward Felix as Vincent&#39;s tone cut through the room. &#34;Our analysts have assessed your business. At best, it comes to five million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an extra dose of pride, Vincent added, &#34;We&#39;re willing to pay five million to take Nova Tech off your hands.&#34; He fixed his eyes on Felix, clearly expecting the man to surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix&#39;s answer was nothing but a cool grin. &#34;Five million? Hard to pass up, I&#39;ll admit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing an opening, Brinley brightened. &#34;Exactly, Mr. Wade. The money could be wired to you before the day ends. On top of that, I can assure you that every employee at Nova Tech would be welcomed at Polaris Tech, yourself included. We&#39;d even love for you to join us as vice chairman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Felix&#39;s expression never wavered, his voice grew firm. &#34;It&#39;s a generous offer from both of you,but...&#34;His eyes narrowed slightly. &#34;I won&#39;t be selling Nova Tech. All debts are settled. There&#39;s no bankruptcy happening here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offering a cordial smile laced with subtle dismissal, Felix remarked, &#34;Regardless, I do thank you for your concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That response sent Brinley reeling. Her subsequent moves hinged on acquiring Nova Tech. Doing her best to hide her disappointment, she composed herself and pressed on. &#34;Is it a matter of numbers, Mr. Wade?Polaris Tech, with the full backing of the Jones Group, can easily increase the offer. Money isn&#39;t an obstacle</p>
                
                
                
                <p>for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s eyes flickered as he glanced up at her briefly, though he stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting Vincent&#39;s look without wavering, Felix replied, &#34;This isn&#39;t a question of finances. Nova Tech was founded through a partnership with someone I hold in the highest regard. Selling isn&#39;t an option. I&#39;m not the person you should be negotiating with. I think it&#39;s time you left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to concede defeat, Brinley made one last attempt. The stakes were too high for her to walk away now. &#34;Mr. Wade, if there are any terms or requirements you&#39;d like us to consider, just say the word.We&#39;re ready to accommodate you however we can.&#34; She positioned herself at the edge of the desk near Vincent,her tone unwavering and earnest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Felix remained unmoved. &#34;I have to refuse. As I mentioned before, Nova Tech isn&#39;t up for sale.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Briney&#39;s professional facade slipped for a split second. She hadn&#39;t anticipated such stubborn resistance, and it dawned on her that a direct approach to the other partner might have been wiser. Despite her displeasure, she held her composure. &#34;Nova Tech hasn&#39;t turned a profit in years. It&#39;s a struggle to keep the business afloat. Aligning with the Jones Group is your surest path to a stable future. Please reconsider,Mr.Wade.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent rose from his seat with the commanding air, his expression cold and composed. &#34;You have three days to think this through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he turned, heading to the door of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brinley remained planted, unwilling to accept defeat so soon. With negotiations already underway,she sensed that a little extra push might tip the scales. After all, who would turn their back on that much money?Certainly not a business barely scraping together a million in annual revenue. It seemed impossible to her that Felix could turn his nose up at a five-million-dollar payout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix, already losing patience, spoke up before she did.&#34;My answer stands. There&#39;s nothing more to reconsider.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a faint creak broke the tension-a sound coming from the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A door edged open. Hannah appeared in the doorway, her steps slow, eyes still foggy with sleep.&#34;Reconsider what?&#34; Her question came out soft and unhurried, carrying the languor of someone who&#39;d just left a sun-warmed bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition flickered across Vincent&#39;s face at the sound of her voice. Instantly, he stopped in his tracks and pivoted. His wife was in another man&#39;s office. The haze of a recent nap still lingered around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thundercloud passed over Vincent&#39;s features, his expression shifting in an instant.</p>
