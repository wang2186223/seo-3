                <p>Chapter of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was why Brinley&#39;s screenshot showing twenty-one calls from Vincent had hit Hannah like a blow-Vincent had never panicked for her like that. When she had desperately needed him, he hadn&#39;t bothered to pick up her calls. All those feelings, however, seemed distant now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arriving home, Hannah bumped into Derek, who had returned to grab some work files for Vincent. A simple question passed her lips. &#34;Did I leave a suit jacket in the car the other day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe Miles wouldn&#39;t care about a jacket, but Hannah felt returning it was the right thing to do. Whether or not he accepted it-that was his business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek hesitated, feigning ignorance. &#34;Mrs. Jones, I didn&#39;t notice anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow knitted in suspicion. &#34;Please look for it for me. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s in the car somewhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a quick nod. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping inside, Hannah barely made it past the hallway before Danica intercepted her, voice sharp with accusation.&#34;I knew it-you hit a dead end with the police, didn&#39;t you? How does it feel to hit a wall?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicion narrowed Hannah&#39;s eyes. &#34;Did you follow me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica didn&#39;t bother to deny it.&#34;So what if I was? Someone has to keep you from disgracing the Jones family.You&#39;re leaving Vincent-why do you keep stirring up trouble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sardonic chuckle escaped Hannah. Her gaze frosted over.&#34;Let&#39;s set the record straight, Danica, if I wanted drama, I&#39;d tear up that divorce agreement and sit tight as Vincent&#39;s wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury crashed across Danica&#39;s face as she slammed her palm on the table. &#34;Don&#39;t you dare!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try me,&#34; Hannah replied, folding her arms. &#34;Friendly reminder-you&#39;ve got 16 days left before transferring the rest of your properties to me. When will I see those deeds?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you already-property transfers take time! What&#39;s got you breathing down my neck?&#34; Danica practically shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s smile was icy. &#34;Don&#39;t get it twisted. I&#39;m not impatient. But let me spell this out-those seven properties better show up, or you can forget ever seeing the divorce agreement again. Let&#39;s see who panics first.&#34; She casually straightened Danica&#39;s collar. &#34;Looking forward to hearing some progress on the property transfer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,Hannah turned on her heel and made for the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thud and crash of furniture being overturned filled the house seconds later, but Hannah climbed the steps without missing a beat. Once in her room, thoughts of rest vanished when Felix&#39;s name popped up on her phone. The office needed her, so out the door she went.	a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos found its way online that night as Nova Tech suddenly faced a tidal wave of public criticism over product safety. A group calling themselves &#34;Victims of Nova Tech&#34; appeared almost overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The company&#39;s response was swift-a product recall was announced, along with a flurry of compensation offers for angry customers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah started digging into the detailed info of the supposed victims, and her search pointed straight to an apartment complex not far from her company. That detail set off every alarm in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours slipped by as she combed through data, and it was deep into the night before she made it back to the Jones estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little sleep did nothing to slow her down. Plans for Sharon&#39;s birthday party came next on her never-ending list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, things at the Jones Group office took a surprising turn. Vincent delivered two orders to Clive.First, he wanted every last project completed within the month because he intended to take a three-month break. Second, he instructed Clive to arrange for a ring with a sixteen-millimeter inner diameter and made it clear that the ring needed to be delivered within three months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Clive could only stare. His mind raced-was Vincent about to propose to Brinley?</p>
