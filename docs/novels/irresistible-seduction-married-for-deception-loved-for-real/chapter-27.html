                <p>&#34;You tell me, Vincent-am I wrong?&#34; Hannah&#39;s voice trembled with anger as she pointed at the bed. &#34;If l hadn&#39;t walked in, would you have already had sex with Brinley right here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bet Vincent understood what this room meant for both of them. After they moved out, Danica had tried over and over to change everything in this room. She had insisted on keeping it just the way it was. This space held real meaning for her. Maybe it meant something to Vincent too, but clearly not enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s voice turned cold. &#34;So you&#39;re just going to accuse me without even asking what really happened? Did you not see me shove her away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw it,&#34; Hannah replied, letting out a short,humorless laugh. &#34;You only pushed her away because I walked in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent laughed out of anger. &#34;How many times do l have to explain? There&#39;s nothing between me and Brinley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so? Nothing at all?&#34; Hannah retorted.&#34;Does &#39;nothing&#39; mean taking her to a hotel? Lying on the same bed with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His patience snapped. He grabbed her wrist and pulled her closer. &#34;I took her to a hotel? Did you see it with your own eyes? Or were you hiding under the bed listening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her hand pressed to his chest to create some distance, she responded sharply, &#34;I saw it with my own eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took off his watch, his eyes fixed on her. &#34;Then tell me-what did you see exactly? What position were we in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could get a word out, Vincent pulled her onto the bed. He pinned her hands over her head,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>because I walked in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>would have made a teasing remark. Maybe she would have leaned in and whispered something daring. He waited for a reaction from the Hannah he knew. But it didn&#39;t come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, she shoved him back, scrambled off his lap, and said coldly, &#34;If you&#39;re aroused, let Brinley take care of it for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made for the door, but Vincent caught her wrist.&#34;There&#39;s nothing happening between me and Brinley.I&#39;ve always told you, she&#39;s like a sister to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; Hannah replied, her voice flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m serious. I&#39;ve never even slept with her,&#34; Vincent remarked, his face set.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah froze. In all his years, he&#39;d only ever dated two women-Brinley and her. So, if he wasn&#39;t lying,that meant back when they first got together,he was - Her eyes dropped, despite herself, landing right where his arousal showed through his pants. &#34;You handle it yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent pulled her closer, his voice rumbling low. &#34;So my dear wife is just going to leave me like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lingered on her lips. The tension between them curled thick and slow, like smoke in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words stirred something inside her. Still,reason rose like a wall between them. It made no difference that he and Brinley had never slept together. Maybe he held back for being a gentleman. That did not change the fact that Brinley had always been the one he truly loved. She had only ever been the substitute.And this was something he could&#39;ve told her earlier,so why was she only hearing it now? None of it mattered anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brinley would love nothing more than to help take care of your desire.&#34; Once again, she tried to push him away, but his arms only tightened around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve spelled it out for you, and you&#39;re still throwing me at another woman?&#34; he asked coldly.</p>
