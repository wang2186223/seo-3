                <p>A glare full of venom shot from Brinley&#39;s eyes. &#34;You shameless bitch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered, Hannah gestured toward the door.&#34;Say whatever you want. Now do us both a favor and leave my room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp retort from Brinley followed. &#34;As if I&#39;d stick around any longer than I have to. Sharon sent me to fetch you for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before heading out, Brinley&#39;s eyes darted to Hannah&#39;s laptop screen. In that split second, something cold and vicious flickered in her face. She had overheard the recording on Hannah&#39;s phone just now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having realized Hannah was on her trail and actually gathering proof, Brinley&#39;s nails dug into her palms,anger simmering just beneath the surface. There was no way she&#39;d let Hannah uncover the truth and turn the tables on her. Not a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah, oblivious to Brinley&#39;s scheming, was too busy to care. With days of skipped meals catching up to her, Sharon&#39;s invitation was as much about concern as family tradition. She closed her laptop and made her way downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last thing Hannah expected was to see Vincent waiting at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I hadn&#39;t called, would you have even bothered returning for dinner, Vincent?&#34; A tired sigh escaped Sharon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent glanced up briefly, just long enough for his and Hannah&#39;s eyes to meet before both looked away.&#34;Work&#39;s been nonstop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon&#39;s patience was wearing thin. &#34;Work demands your presence 24/7, huh? You can&#39;t even show your face at home. No wonder I still don&#39;t have a great-grandchild.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent pressed his fingers to his temples. &#34;Grandma, making a baby isn&#39;t that simple. It couldn&#39;t be rushed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The response didn&#39;t soften her expression. &#34;Time isn&#39;t on my side. When do you plan to try to have a baby with Hannah? After I&#39;m dead and buried? I don&#39;t care what&#39;s on your schedule tonight. After dinner, you&#39;re going upstairs with Hannah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s brow twitched. Sharing a bed with Vincent? Hell no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling Hannah closer, Sharon&#39;s tone gentled. &#34;Sweetheart, I know you&#39;ve been putting in long hours.Please, get some rest tonight. I just want what&#39;s best for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of awkwardness colored Hannah&#39;s reply. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley, refusing to fade into the background, hurried over to Vincent and eagerly launched into a discussion about the subsidiary&#39;s affairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every now and then, Vincent offered a suggestion or nodded along, giving her just enough attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the while, Hannah kept her eyes on her plate, not saying a word as the conversation swirled around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once dinner ended, Hannah wasted no time slipping away, drawn back to her laptop to finish up details for Sharon&#39;s birthday celebration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Vincent emerged from the shower, hair damp and water still clinging to his neck.He reached for the hairdryer and then eventually collapsed onto the bed without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon&#39;s insistence meant he was spending the night at home for a change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her work finished, Hannah slipped into the bathroom, showered, and climbed into bed, staking out the very edge of the mattress for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That silence didn&#39;t last long. The bed dipped under Vincent&#39;s weight as he shifted closer, arms finding their way around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stiffened and then wriggled free. &#34;If you want sex, Brinley&#39;s room is upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move. Just let me hold you,&#34; he murmured, pulling her back into his arms. She smelled faintly of her citrusy body wash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounded utterly exhausted. When it became clear she wouldn&#39;t break his grip, she stopped resisting.Soon,his steady breathing filled the silence-he had fallen asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing him away seemed pointless. With only two weeks left before the divorce, she figured there was no sense turning it into a war zone. Besides, exhaustion from work and party planning had kept her own sleep fitful at best. Eventually, she let herself relax and surrendered to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning arrived to find herself curled against Vincent&#39;s chest, one arm slung across his waist. His pajama shirt hung slightly open, a few buttons mysteriously undone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Propping himself up, Vincent met her gaze. &#34;Did you rest well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a moment, Hannah slid out of bed, her face unreadable. &#34;You&#39;re not exactly winning points as a cuddle buddy. You&#39;re far worse than the male escorts I&#39;ve hired.&#34;</p>
