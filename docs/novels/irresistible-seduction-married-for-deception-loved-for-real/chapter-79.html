                <p>Descending the stairs with her laptop, Hannah found Danica already settled in the living room, engaged in friendly conversation with Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making no effort to greet them, Hannah slipped quietly onto the sofa beside Sharon and began powering up her computer, ready to present her ideas-only to be interrupted by Vincent. &#34;If I&#39;m not mistaken, Brinley&#39;s in charge of this birthday celebration planning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Hannah sat frozen, a wave of powerlessness washing over her. Her gaze narrowed on Vincent.He really was determined to deny her even the smallest bit of respect. He understood exactly how much Sharon meant to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica chimed in, &#34;Exactly. Hannah, you&#39;re just helping this year. Don&#39;t get your roles mixed up.&#34; Linking arms with Brinley, she smiled. &#34;Brinley, you have crafted a plan, right? Why don&#39;t you run upstairs and grab your laptop to show it to Sharon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a well-practiced look of embarrassment, Brinley nodded and hurried upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bewilderment flickered across Sharon&#39;s face as she glanced back and forth between Hannah and Danica.&#34;What&#39;s going on? Hasn&#39;t Hannah always organized my birthday?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent said nothing, cold eyes occasionally settling on Hannah with an unspoken warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not missing a beat, Danica tried to smooth things over. &#34;Brinley&#39;s just returned from overseas and wanted to do something special for you. It&#39;s your seventieth birthday, after all. Hannah has planned every celebration until now-surely she won&#39;t mind letting someone else take a turn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp crack in Sharon&#39;s voice cut through the room. &#34;Nonsense. Tell me-who is Brinley to us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica froze, at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a determined push, Sharon stood, gripping her cane tightly. Her glare never wavered. &#34;Brinley doesn&#39;t belong to this family. She&#39;s not one of us. But Hannah is my granddaughter-in-law. And you want to put my birthday in the hands of an outsider? What exactly were you thinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica had always been a little intimidated by Sharon. Now, she didn&#39;t dare say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah lifted her head, emotiontightening her chest as she watched Sharon defend her so fiercely. Deep down, she had always known-no one in tis house truly cared about her except Sharon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Brinley was making her way down from the third floor when she caught the tail of Sharon&#39;s words. A sharp pang twisted in her chest. That single word, outsider, was alI Sharon had ever seen her as.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the tension, Vincent spoke up, massaging his temple. &#34;Grandma, Brinley isn&#39;t some outsider.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharon&#39;s fury turned toward him. &#34;Don&#39;t even get me started on you, Vincent! You just stood there and let your wife be reduced to an assistant to an outsider? Is this how you treat your own wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every bit of bitterness and scorn flickered in Hannah&#39;s gaze. The answer was obvious to anyone watching-Vincent&#39;s heart was with Brinley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words of self-defense nevercame from Vincent. He absorbed the criticism, silent and unmoving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Sharon had said her piece, Vincent answered in a low voice, &#34;You&#39;re blowing this out of proportion.They each came up with a plan, so you can just take a look at both.&#34; He left the decision squarely in Sharon&#39;s hands. &#34;Pick whichever you like best. It&#39;s upto you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica muttered to herself, &#34;We&#39;ve already settled that Brinley would take charge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One cold stare from Sharon silenced her. &#34;Don&#39;t forget, none of you even bothered to ask me before deciding my birthday would be run by someone outside the family. Still want to argue? Then go ahead with the celebration without me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was enough to keep Danica quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every fresh defeat for Danica brought a trace of laughter to Hannah&#39;s lips. A turn of her head put her face-to-face with Vincent. Whatever amusement she felt evaporated, replaced by a wry,dismissive smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent caught every nuance. His gaze grew colder, sharper than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, Brinley glided back downstairs, laptop in hand, pretending to have missed all the tension. She wedged herself between Sharon and Vincent with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising almost instantly, Vincent stepped aside. &#34;I&#39;ll let you all talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley and Hannah each presented their own plan for the birthday celebration. Sharon listened closely,questions sharp and probing, like a CEO testing her board.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Responses came readily. Brinley&#39;s answers were polished, but Hannah&#39;s were thoughtful and exacting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came time to choose, Sharon made her preference clear. Hannah&#39;s proposal won, hands down.</p>
