                <p>Something hard flickered in Brinley&#39;s eyes, but the moment she noticed Vincent drawing near, a wounded expression replaced it. &#34;Hannah, I was just asking. I didn&#39;t mean anything by it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah stepped forward, her tone bright with sarcasm.&#34;Oh, I was just giving you a heads-up.Nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharp-tongued and unbothered, Hannah left Brinley no room to fight back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerves got the better of Brinley as she balled her hands into fists. But glancing at Vincent, she pasted on a sugary smile and slipped her arm through his.&#34;Vincent, you must be exhausted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uninterested glance from Hannah caught the scene, but she kept walking, ignoring them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent gently untangled himself from Brinley&#39;s grasp. &#34;GGo on ahead. I have something to discuss with Derek.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, Brinley hesitated. &#34;Alright,&#34; she said, disappointment coloring her features as she turned away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Derek hurried over from the car, holding a suit jacket. &#34;Mr. Jones,your wife accidentally left this behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shadowed eyes fixed on the jacket, Vincent&#39;s voice dropped. &#34;Check who owns this jacket.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertainty crept into Derek&#39;s question. &#34;Alright.Should I return it to Mrs. Jones?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get rid of it,&#34; Vincent said,his tone ice-cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek didn&#39;t dare argue. He nodded and left without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the dining room was already set with dishes that smelled freshly made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound of approaching footsteps, Danica spun around with a bright greeting-her smile freezing instantly as she spotted Hannah. &#34;Why are you back?&#34; The warmth vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A raised eyebrow from Hannah made her intentions clear.&#34;Am I not allowed to return here? Until I hand over the divorce papers, I still belong to this family.So I&#39;ll come and go as I please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow clouded Danica&#39;s face. &#34;You&#39;ve split from Vincent already. If you had any sense, you&#39;d keep your distance. Why stick around-what&#39;s your real motive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah let a brittle laugh fill the room.&#34;Oh, I see.The real problem is me ruining the happy little scene between Brinley and Vincent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, Danica stayed silent, which said enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An edge crept into Hannah&#39;s smile. &#34;Isn&#39;t it funny?You&#39;re so eager to see me out, but you haven&#39;t even handed over the properties you promised. Is this how you make good on your deals, Danica?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You keep acting like I&#39;m dragging my feet. I told you it wasn&#39;t going to happen overnight. I gave you my word.What, do you really believe I&#39;d hesitate over a handful of houses?&#34; Danica&#39;s voice shot up as she got emotional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Vincent entered and caught the last part of the exchange. A frown creased his brow.&#34;What houses?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not bothering to spare him a look, Hannah simply lifted an eyebrow at Danica, a hint of amusement in her eyes. &#34;Yeah, what houses?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Covering quickly, Danica waved off the question.&#34;Oh, it&#39;s nothing at all. Hannah was just interested in one of my properties. Isn&#39;t that right, Hannah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp glance from Danica served as a silent warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shrugging, Hannah gave her a cold, mocking smile.&#34;Whatever you say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing the seat beside Hannah, Vincent loosened his collar and settled in. &#34;Mom&#39;s properties aren&#39;t half bad. Are you planning on living in one, or is this about investment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah shot him a suspicious look. &#34;Why does it matter to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a businesslike tone, Vincent replied, &#34;I could help you make the right call.&#34; Years of experience had taught him how to spot a good deal. Every part of the Jones Group had flourished under his watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah paused for a second and then said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the conversation continued, Brinley remained off to the side, ignored and out of place. Fingernails biting into her palm, she kept her features smooth and pleasant. &#34;Mrs. Jones, now that Vincent&#39;s back,why don&#39;t we all eat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jumping in to smooth things over, Danica added,&#34;Brinley put together the whole meal and wouldn&#39;t touch a single dish until you arrived, Vincent.She&#39;s always so  With a small, demure smile, Brinley ducked her head.&#34;Mrs. Jones, you give me too much credit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley ladled soup into Vincent&#39;s bowl and placed it in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking around the table, Hannah asked, &#34;Where&#39;s Sharon? Isn&#39;t she eating with us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica answered lightly, not missing a beat, &#34;She&#39;s getting on in years and turned in early. Had some porridge and went straight to bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While talking, Danica continued to pile food onto Vincent&#39;s plate. &#34;Here, have some more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Vincent closely, Brinley waited for his reaction. &#34;Vincent, do you like the meal? I tried a new recipe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without much interest, Vincent barely touched the food before putting down his utensils. The soup went untouched. &#34;There&#39;s no need for you to cook or serve me,&#34; he said, his voice indifferent. &#34;Wehave plenty of staff for that.&#34;considerate.&#34;</p>
