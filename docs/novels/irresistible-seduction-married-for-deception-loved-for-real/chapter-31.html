                <p>Vincent&#39;s expression grew even colder. &#34;What happened here? Tell me straight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley lowered her gaze, silent tears slipping down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica was the first to explode, grabbing Vincent&#39;s arm in outrage.&#34;I&#39;d just finished breakfast and went up to check on Brinley. The moment I walked in, I found her in tears. No matter how many times I asked, she wouldn&#39;t say a word. That&#39;s when I knew-something serious had gone on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get to the point,&#34; Vincent snapped, his patience wearing thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica hesitated for a moment, visibly irritated by the interruption, but then continued, &#34;The point is-Brinley discovered that the harassment at the club was planned. And it was your wife who paid those men!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s gaze locked on Brinley. &#34;How do you know it was Hannah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley looked as if she wanted to disappear, her face drained and uncertain, as though she hated being the one to speak. Danica rubbed her shoulder and remarked softly, &#34;You can say it, Brinley. We&#39;re here to support you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, Danica sent a sharp glare in Hannah&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah ignored her entirely, keeping her attention fixed on the supposed evidence. The phone&#39;s screen displayed screenshots of chat logs, messages Brinley claimed had been forwarded to her. The exchange discussed paying two men to scare a woman-harassment was the goal, but anything more would be fine.The payment shown was 100, 000 dollars. The transfer record read: Hannah Scott. This was a setup-meticulously planned from the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah arched an eyebrow, looked at Brinley, and said calmly, &#34;That wasn&#39;t my doing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica sneered, &#34;Still deny/it? Your name is right there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the scene at breakfast, Danica had been itchy for an opportunity to bring Hannah down. This was exactly what she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley lingered in silence, looking as if she was wrestling with herself, and finally managed to speak. &#34;That night, after Vincent took me home, I couldn&#39;t stop having nightmares. I kept wondering what I&#39;d done wrong,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>so I hired someone to investigate. That&#39;s how I found those messages and the bank transfer.&#34; Tears rolled down her cheeks. &#34;I just never imagined that Hannah would hate me enough to destroy me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica pulled Brinley close, throwing an accusing finger at Hannah. &#34;Did you hear that? And you still refuse to admit what you did? You malicious snake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah let out a laugh. &#34;Well, since you&#39;re so sure I paid off those men, then bring them in. Let&#39;s hear their story right to my face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley&#39;s crying became even more dramatic. &#34;I... I just can&#39;t do that. I never want to see those men again.Just the thought of them makes me sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah raised an eyebrow. &#34;Or is it possible you&#39;re just scared of what might come out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica erupted. &#34;How can you be so heartless? Can&#39;t you see she&#39;s traumatized? She doesn&#39;t want to relive any of it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally, Danica took Brinley&#39;s side without question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s voice grew cold. &#34;Maybe the real reason Brinley won&#39;t face them is because none of it was real.Maybe the whole thing was staged. Maybe this little act is just a way to drag my name through the mud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica flushed with rage.&#34;Unbelievable! First,you hurt her, and now, you call her a liar? You&#39;re despicable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica raised her hand, ready to slap Hannah. Vincent stepped in, catching Danica&#39;s wrist before she could follow through.</p>
