                <p>A glimmer of satisfaction flickered in Hannah&#39;s eyes as Vincent&#39;s expression turned stormy. She turned on her heel and walked into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A meticulous makeup routine followed-foundation,blush, eyeliner, lipstick-each detail flawless. With a trip to the police station ahead, Hannah wasn&#39;t leaving anything to chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting her reflection, Vincent straightened his tie and watched the pleased smile touch her lips. &#34;Where are you headed today?&#34; he asked quietly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bright as day, Hannah met his gaze in the mirror.&#34;That&#39;s none of your concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash of frustration, Vincent flung his watch onto the dresser, seized her wrist, and pressed her firmly against the vanity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without bothering to look up, Hannah tried to twist away from his grip, irritation in every movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you shy away from me? Is there something you&#39;re trying to keep from me?&#34; Vincent pressed and tightened his grip on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered over her face. Her makeup only heightened her natural beauty. He was momentarily dazed and couldn&#39;t tear his eyes off her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his brief distraction, Hannah wrenched free and scowled. &#34;Quit grabbing me.I&#39;mnotyour property.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence hung in the air as Vincent reclaimed his watch. &#34;Your lipstick&#39;s smeared,&#34; he said flatly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he left, Hannah checked her reflection again.Not a single flaw could be found-her lipstick was as perfect as before. Shrugging it off, she closed her compact and set it aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah headed out, destination clear-the police station. Her statement was recorded, and a formal case was opened. Only one step remained: waiting for the authorities to summon Brinley for questioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her next stop was the office. Brainstorming with her team, she floated the idea of a safety bracelet designed for women. While thoughts and sketches filled her mind, she reached for her phone,hoping to capture the inspiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, a notification lit up her screen-Brinley had just posted on Instagram: &#34;Four all-nighters later-finally done. Hope Sharon will love it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the photo, Brinley was holding onto a man&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with just one glance, Hannah recognized the owner immediately-it was Vincent&#39;s. Suddenly,the exhaustion Vincent had shown last night made perfect sense. He&#39;d been busy helping Brinley with the banquet planning, not just with work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp sting shot through Hannah&#39;s palm as her nails dug in, her composure briefly faltering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing the phone aside, Hannah forced herself to focus on the meeting. She threw herself into work,staying long after everyone else had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the end of the day, Felix insisted on driving Hannah home. She didn&#39;t refuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chivalry came naturally to Felix. He opened the car door for her when they arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet &#34;Thank you&#34; escaped Hannah&#39;s lips. But as she stepped onto the driveway, Vincent&#39;s figure came into view, standing a few yards away, watching with cold intensity. His mood was unmistakably sour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah acted like she didn&#39;t notice Vincent&#39;s foul mood, waving as she said goodbye to Felix. Then,she turned to walk toward the house and taunted Vincent,not breaking her stride, &#34;Switching careers to bodyguard now? I guess it suits you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent ignored the jibe and trailed her. Shadows darkened his features. &#34;So the full face of makeup was for your date with another man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkness flashed in Vincent&#39;s eyes, displeasure etched in every line of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Planting her feet, Hannah spun around and met his gaze,chin tipped up in challenge. &#34;That&#39;s right. Got an issue with it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scowl deepened across Vincent&#39;s brow. &#34;Felix Wade.CEO of Nova Tech. Focuses on women&#39;s security gadgets.His company&#39;s hanging by a thread.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of surprise flickered across Hannah&#39;s face as she faced him fully. &#34;You really went out of your way to dig into him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance quickly replaced her surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sidestepped her question, letting his voice go icy.&#34;Is he the reason behind your desire for a divorce?Discarding me for a man about to lose his business?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied instantly, &#34;Felix has nothing to do with my request for a divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A muscle tensed in Vincent&#39;s jaw. &#34;You&#39;d better mean your words. Because if he is the reason, I&#39;ll make sure his pathetic little company collapses by tomorrów.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heaviness pressed on Hannah&#39;s chest. She leveled her voice. &#34;Vincent, what&#39;s gotten into you? Felix hasn&#39;t crossed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I&#39;m pissed off, then yeah, he has.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No words came as she stared at him, feeling the familiar wall of his stubbornness. &#34;You...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence stretched, thick and uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A passing gust lifted the hem of Hannah&#39;s pale green dress, the fabric trailing across Vincent&#39;s shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, he slipped off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders. &#34;Wind&#39;s picking up. Let&#39;s go inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t move, eyes downcast. &#34;I&#39;m not cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then shrugged off the jacket. It slipped from her shoulders and fell to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a backward glance, Hannah walked ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lump formed in Vincent&#39;s throat. He opened his mouth but couldn&#39;t find the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, his phone buzzed. He answered, voice like steel. &#34;Talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek&#39;s words came quickly. &#34;Mr. Jones, I&#39;ve confirmed the harassment incident involving Miss Gilbert. It&#39;s real.&#34; After a brief pause, he added, &#34;But it seems your wife might have something to do with it.&#34;</p>
