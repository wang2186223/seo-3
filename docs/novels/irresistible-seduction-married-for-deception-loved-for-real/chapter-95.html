                <p>Silvercrest Mall was positioned just a short walk from the Nova Tech headquarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix took Hannah out there for lunch first, having reserved an upscale dining spot with a calm, elegant atmosphere-ideal for a quiet break together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the setting invited ease, Hannah&#39;s mind stayed locked on the hormone-monitoring wristband.Their conversation hovered around the project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After slicing his steak, Felix slid his plate across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah gently nudged it back. &#34;I&#39;ve got it. Thanks,though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he insisted, sliding it toward her once more.&#34;Come on. You&#39;re the brain behind this whole thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a light smile. &#34;You&#39;re overstating it just a little, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone shifted, serious now. &#34;Not really. That wristband-it&#39;s genius. The product reminded me of the early days of Nova Tech-full of energy and life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when the company was at its lowest-on the brink of bankruptcy-they&#39;d pivoted toward male-centric products out of necessity, a strategy that led to repeated setbacks and lackluster outcomes.Thankfully, the tides had shifted. Nova Tech was once more headed in a favorable direction. Felix felt a flush of satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix spoke. &#34;Stop refusing the plate of steak, or l might start feeling hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He winked playfully at her, making Hannah chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,thank you then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t mention it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lightheartedness faded as Hannah steered the conversation back to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix quipped with a lopsided smile, &#34;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re dreaming about the wristband project at night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head. &#34;Nope. When I go to bed, I don&#39;t dream at all-I sleep straight through till morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her daily schedule drained her completely-research by day, planning the birthday festivities by evening-leaving no space for restless thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No pointless worries. No constant tension. Just focus, direction, and a sense of control. That was Hannah&#39;s version of contentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix looked genuinely relieved for her, but after a moment, his brow furrowed with concern. He paused, voice low. &#34;Last time, with Vincent...Everything okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing worthy to fret over,&#34; she replied, a faint smile flickering, though not quite holding. &#34;We&#39;re getting divorced. What&#39;s there to stress about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their recent conflict had been explosive, and now they were in the middle of a sient war. Neither made a move to bridge the gap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for Hannah, that silence was bliss. No passive-aggressive stares. No pointless arguments. Just peace. That was all she needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m really glad to hear that,&#34; Felix said softly. His eyes lowered. &#34;So, when are you finalizing it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not long now. Just a few more days.&#34; Time kept pushing forward. Only five more remained until Vincent&#39;s grandmother&#39;s birthday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her answer, a subtle delight flickered in Felix&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lunch ended on an easy note, and Hannah expressed her thanks more than once before they left the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, Felix guided her toward a jewelry boutique.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah glanced around, intrigued. &#34;Picking something for someone? Your mom or your girlfriend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer. Instead, he exchanged a brief look with the store clerk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, this piece might interest you,&#34; the clerk offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix lifted a slender bracelet, holding it up for Hannah to see. &#34;What do you think of this one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She studied it carefully. &#34;The floral detail is really intricate. It&#39;s beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix&#39;s lips curved slightly. He shot a glance at the clerk, who caught on right away. &#34;I&#39;ll help you try it on,&#34; the clerk offered, stepping in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait-I&#39;m not-&#34; Hannah instinctively pulled back,her eyes darting to Felix for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect,&#34; he said with a grin. &#34;Try it on for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clerk moved quickly. Before Hannah could protest again, bracelet was already clasped around her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix&#39;s eyes gleamed. &#34;See? Fits you like it was made for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah reached to undo the clasp, eager to return it -but just then, a scornful voice rang out across the room. &#34;Look who it is. Mr. Jones&#39;s kept woman.What happened-did he throw you out already?&#34;</p>
