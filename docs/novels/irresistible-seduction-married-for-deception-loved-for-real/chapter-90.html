                <p>Clive quietly slipped away to arrange for a company car. When the vehicle arrived, Brinley climbed in, her mood sour and written all over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling into the front seat, Clive couldn&#39;t help but notice Brinley&#39;s frustration, so he started thinking of ways to lift her spirits. He suddenly thought of the ring he had shown Vincent earlier in the day. He should have kept it a secret from Brinley, but today felt different, and he figured it might just cheer her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out the small box with enthusiasm.&#34;Miss Gilbert, would you like to see something special?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since Brinley had taken over Polaris Tech, everyone at the Jones Group went out of their way to please her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A touch of curiosity entered Brinley&#39;s voice. &#34;What do you have there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She accepted the square box from Clive&#39;s hand, her fingers lingering on the lid. When she opened it, a set of matching rings greeted her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delight sparked in Brinley&#39;s expression, and she gasped, &#34;Are these... Did Vincent have these made?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clive nodded, eager to please. &#34;Who else would have prepared them except Mr. Jones?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my!&#34; Brinley hadn&#39;t expected Vincent to have the rings ready so soon. She was truly surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take a look up close, Miss Gilbert. The craftsmanship of the rings is remarkable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brinley lifted the woman&#39;s ring and studied it with bright, admiring eyes. She couldn&#39;t help but slip the ring onto her left hand. It slid on easily and looked absolutely stunning. Her excitement got the better of her, and she pulled out her phone to snap a few photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Clive watched her admire the ring, a question popped into his head. The fit was so perfect on Brinley&#39;s finger. Why did Vincent insist on resizig it by just a single millimeter? He quickly shrugged it off, deciding Vincent must have his reasons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little nervously, Clive leaned in.&#34;Miss Gilbert, if Mr. Jones does propose, please pretend I never showed you the ring. If he hears I spoiled the surprise, he&#39;ll never forgive me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile tugged at Brinley&#39;s lips, and her eyes lit up with amusement as she took off the ring and handed the ring box back to him. &#34;You don&#39;t have to worry. I&#39;Il act like I never laid eyes on those rings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found herself already picturing the moment Vincent might get down on one knee and propose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent kept his foot heavy on the gas, racing back to the Jones family estate at speeds nearing 120kilometers per hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone rang partway through the drive, and Derek&#39;s voice came through the speaker. &#34;Mr. Jones, I&#39;ve managed to redecorate your room based on your sketch. Due to time constraints, the details leave room to improve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Vincent answered simply and hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, the car fell silent again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah spent the entire trip staring out the window, refusing to look at Vincent or speak to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they finally reached the house, Vincent didn&#39;t bother with small talk. He caught her wrist and dragged her straight upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing, Vincent?&#34; Hannah tried to yank her hand free, but he didn&#39;t let go. Her bare feet barely kept upo as he yanked her into their bedroom on the second floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent&#39;s hold was unyielding, and when he finally released her, she was thrown onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From now on, I want you to stay home and focus on planning Grandma&#39;s birthday celebration.&#34; His eyes stayed cold as he laid out his demands. &#34;You&#39;re not to leave the house or spend time with anyone questionable, especially Felix.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter laugh slipped from Hannah. &#34;And why should I listen to you?&#34; She got off the bed, her brow furrowed in anger. &#34;You&#39;re out of line. Do you really think you can lock me up like a prisoner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vincent swallowed, struggling to suppress his fury. &#34;I am your husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met his gaze, refusing to back down. &#34;So what? Just because you&#39;re my husband doesn&#39;t mean you get to control my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah stepped forward, jabbing her finger into his chest as she spoke with resolve.&#34;If I want to leave or see someone, that&#39;s for me to decide, not you.&#34; And it wouldn&#39;t be long before he was nothing more than her ex-husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though her pokes were more defiant than forceful, Vincent&#39;s patience snapped, and on the third jab, he caught her wrist in his grip.</p>
