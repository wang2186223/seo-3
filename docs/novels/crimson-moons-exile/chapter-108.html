                <p>A/N: HAPPY MOTHER&#39;S DAY!!!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sorry I was gone. I wrote the while gone, and I liked what I was making but the concept was fucked up, but I wanted to play around with the harshness of the world I made... It&#39;s not fair. The weak suffer no matter the race, and people in power oftentimes get away with their wrong doing . But not today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also I know some of my ideas are pretty out there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boys wagged their tails now that they were dry. I was sick the entire night and most of the morning, but it didn&#39;t stop our responsibilities. Kaizen was with the pups the entire night. They still needed care every 4 and a half hours now, but he didn&#39;t mind. He did their bottles and gave them potty breaks while I tried to sleep without throwing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We only had to change the sheets once. That cake gave me food poisoning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had the pups washed, and fed some of my reserve milk since I didn&#39;t want them sick too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know if it was possible but it didn&#39;t hurt to be safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked a little haggard, but I was fine. The boys would come with me to the park. They probably couldn&#39;t enjoy anything yet, but Kaizen remembers this time when he was small. I want their first memories to be good ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment my hand touched the door, I got a link from Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Be safe./ He said happily. It was nice to hear him relaxed too... To be fair, I knew even if I shifted and went for a run, at least Jack would follow. I would never be alone. And it was a little comforting to know that. I had a pet carrier for the boys, and I put them in the back seat. I could tell some presence lingered around, so I was sure at least one Shadow Warrior followed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can come out.&#34; I said as casually as I could, and played off how much that bothered me when Jack had one side, and Ink sat on the other. I didn&#39;t really know him that well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was Jack&#39;s idea.&#34; Ink pointed, and Jack scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You rat!&#34; He smiled. &#34;Do we *still* startle you Luna?&#34; He asked as if it were a little comical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s more like you make my skin crawl when you&#39;re behind me like that. I can&#39;t see you, but I know you&#39;re there. I hate that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You *still* can&#39;t see us? I thought all royal bloods could.&#34; Said Ink with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She wasn&#39;t born a shifter, go easy on her.&#34; Said Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, right. Sorry. Next time, look for his outline. Once you see it, you&#39;ll always see a Shadow Warrior, regardless of how good they are.&#34; He grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started the car, and ignored how giddy they were about this park trip too. Many elders are like big flippin&#39; kids. That isn&#39;t a bad thing though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you mean well. Say, what&#39;s it like being a Shadow Warrior?&#34; I asked. Ink answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re dual citizens, yet you never feel at home anywhereWe also aren&#39;t allowed high ranks regardless of strength because of our occupation. There&#39;s also Long hours, no trust, but the killing&#39;s good. I personally enjoy the hunt part of it all but Jack relishes the killing part.&#34; He said honestly. &#34;I&#39;m doing my dream job. Despite the overtime, it doesn&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve worked a day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For me, I&#39;m self-taught. The killing part is almost like a reward.&#34; Jack admitted. &#34;If you permit us, we can teach your pups. I&#39;m sure stealth like this will benefit them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll think about it.&#34; I said honestly They were not just werewolves; they were already marked by and for Hell.  It was technically a &#39;bad thing&#39; but only for those who do bad things. They were this world&#39;s protectors, just tiny at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got out, the mostly women and children who were at the park wanted to see my pups, but kept their distance. I think it was mostly because of me, since I wasn&#39;t hostile, but I sent nonverbal cues that I didn&#39;t want the attention. It&#39;s stressful I know they wouldn&#39;t hurt them, but I can never be too careful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately that had been my newest hang up as a mom I worried about someone else doing something they shouldn&#39;t and if I was enough to stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They wagged their tails while I held them. I was looking for a nice grassy part they could wiggle around. Ink wound up getting a blanket for me, and Jack got some snacks from the park&#39;s vending machine. It was soda, chips, and I had a baby bag with the boy&#39;s things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I put them down, they &#39;ran&#39; for the grass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See, they already have a taste for adventure.&#34; Said Ink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you remember this age?&#34; I asked. &#34;Kaizen said he could.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, but I don&#39;t doubt that.&#34; he chuckled. &#34;I remember my second birthday. I think that&#39;s when I was taken to training camp. I saw my mother plenty of times after that, but not much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s horrid.&#34; I said as he laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s more like. Fancy daycare until you can shift. The pack taught me secrets that I&#39;ve used my entire life. I have no regrets.&#34; He said with a firm nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know how old I was when I followed the King.&#34; Said Jack. &#34;I taught myself how to become shadows to serve, but it wasn&#39;t enough. I don&#39;t remember *exactly* what I did to warrant my first arrest, but they held me about a day before I got bored and escaped.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think your records say that you killed pack.&#34; I said seeing him flop on his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds about right. I don&#39;t really have that distinction like the others.&#34; Jack admitted. &#34;But with the boss&#39;s blood, I can&#39;t do what I want without permission. I don&#39;t mind that though, since it gives me the freedom of not having to run.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you feel about it Ink?&#39; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be fair, I have a strong sense of pride serving the King&#39;s brother.&#34; Said Ink. &#34;You probably don&#39;t realize, but Lord Kaizen has so much sway, that he could ask pretty much anything, and it would be done within 24 hours. It is an honor to serve. An even greater one to have his acknowledgement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t think of that.&#34; I admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s probably for the best. If you were a snobby royal, this gig would be insufferable.&#34; Said Ink as a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vex took a blade of grass in his mouth, and I smelled it burning. The small puff of smoke was only a hair thin, but I was proud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you look at that.&#34; Said Jack. &#34;He&#39;s learned how to use fire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sure did. He and his brother chewed on grass a blade at a time, and they gummed the grass until it blackened with their powers. I let them have at it. I had a Koke, and cheese puffs. I&#39;d feed them when they get hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched the older pups in the distance play soccer, and I let them wonder about 5 feet away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Do you have a minute?/ Linked Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Give me a second./ I linked back. I still found it so convenient that most shifters can do this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two can go if you like; I need to take a quick call.&#34; I said seeing them both look a little excited about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We won&#39;t leave the park.&#34; Said Ink. He vanished immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll just take a nap right here.&#34; Said Jack. Within moments, he snored, and I relaxed. His senses were razor sharp. If there was a threat, he&#39;d know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/So what&#39;s up?/ I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/I&#39;m researching a wolf who let her instincts get the better of her. Young, unmated females are a strange lot every so often you catch one who shoots their shot to be Luna. Granted, this can happen to any highly ranked wolf, but she slept with her Alpha as a plot to be Luna, and he cast her out. She&#39;s like 5 months./</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/She won&#39;t be a problem here. I can bet money that he knew she could be seduced and didn&#39;t care about the consequences. / I linked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/He&#39;s their Alpha. There&#39;s little lower ranked wolves, nor the council will do. I got this. I just don&#39;t want you in the dark if she does start something./ he linked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack slept like a rock, and I took a picture of the boys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess it&#39;s just us then.&#34; I said picking up Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wiggled, wanting to be free, since the grass was his new toy. I put him down and he crawled, sniffing the air for the spot he was working on.  I was shaded suddenly by someone, and when I looked up, the frosty aura of the man surprised me, but I recognized the scent. The sun made him a bit of a silhouette.</p>

                <p>The Reaper appeared, scythe and all.. He was skipping work to play with puppies. Why were all these old, powerful people so interested in my boys? I thought I&#39;d never see any of the Princes of Hell so often, nor the King, but of all the emotions they had, it seemed a sense of kinship was strong.</p>
