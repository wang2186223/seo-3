                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...... Rick Rick told me that you can see people&#39;s past. I&#39;m sorry.&#34; She said as I pulled into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The bullying is hard to watch, but you have my word that I will never allow this here.&#34; I hissed. &#34;Welcome to Misfit. All of us are fucked up or over, but I only allow good people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know what to say But Rick TRIED to take her with him, but Green fucking blocked him. He didn&#39;t Want her, but he didn&#39;t want to be rid of her either</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OH MY GODS!&#34; Screamed Rick, freaking out who wouldn&#39;t? If this was Grace, I don&#39;t know if this planet would still be here. Aureus would be a Fucking Rug if he broke her heart. &#34;What did he DO to you?!&#34; his yelling gathered a crowd. &#34;HE GOT YOU PREGNANT?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gabble was sweet but Frankhe didn&#39;t want me.&#34; She cried. He hugged her. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. He mated me but Tyna blocked him from marking meand&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough.&#34; I growled. &#34;Do not be sorry Green let his wolf out so he could keep fucking Tyna without his wolf acting up.. But fear not. The child you hold will be on the King&#39;s Council.&#34; I said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the wolf, she was pack before she crossed my border in my eyes. I already hold her brother and he is useful. Since his placement here, and my Alpha status, he&#39;s helped me and Ace to no end It angers me that I can do nothing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She has not gotten justice, and I&#39;m too impatient to wait I want it Now like the demigod I  am. Grandma to block me has plans</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be sorry!... I should have been stronger...I&#39;ve been trying this whole time&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He ordered I stop talking to you.&#34; She sniffled. &#34;That&#39;s why I only texted you when I got home. Then Luna started checking my phone I got lashes for every word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;s been texting him every day</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A red scroll that I couldn&#39;t destroy or let go appeared. This one wasn&#39;t a warning. It was a command. FINE.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. Alpha, please tell me that fucker&#39;s dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not.&#34; I said firmly. &#34;I have been ordered to stave my hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I said what the scroll said out loud, I could burn it. I put my rage into that the flames became a dark purple I&#39;d gained black fire from this. Should I ever get the chance, I&#39;ll thank them by roasting them with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s going to be alright We have doctors and lawyers here to no end look at you I&#39;m so sorry. If I was stronger, I could have killed him&#34; Rick looked away in shame. &#34;Look at what he did to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He would not be breathing if those were from him. Tyna did this.&#34; I said firmly. &#34;Round up the Omegas, and every ranked pack member.&#34; I barked. I know the whole pack heard that summons I saw Sentinel lazily make his way over too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha.&#34; Many bowed. Willow sleepily walked through the crowd, but woke up seeing how badly beaten Reeta was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why does the Goddess stop me from smiting her children?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bids I spend no more divine magic their way</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god&#34; She said holding her hands to her lips. &#34;Let&#39;s get her to the infirmary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Luna.&#34; Said Rick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow without hesitation went to help her new pack member I know she&#39;s tired but we Upper Ranks don&#39;t get breaks. I didn&#39;t even know what time it was. Teleporting tends to do that to me, but I had to address the pack. I did this for Every Omega.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Former Luna of GreenMoon was Banished for her actions.&#34; I said first. &#34;For those who lust beyond your station, You will get a formal warning here and now. Your place is your place. To move up and down here is with Merit, not who you fuck!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Sir!&#34; Shouted my Warriors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And no hand is to be laid on the Weak.&#34; I said with narrowed eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Second That.&#34; Growled Sentinel. We fist bumped. &#34;If I catch you, I&#39;m throwing you on the Ring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was then that my flames shot high in the sky. The thought of this happening here pissed me All the way off. That was It. I&#39;d had it. If not for Willow I&#39;d have left to go on a killing spree. GreenMoon would be no more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If *I* catch Anyone bullying Omegas, or the equivalent to your people, whatever peace you think you have, whatever cherished little nook here you Think you can hide in, you Won&#39;t.&#34; I scoffed. &#34;You fucking won&#39;t I can bet you that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\----8:30am-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reeta was safe, and she was with pup. About two months along according to grandfather He also blessed that pup because grandma asked. He will be a son, one who will be about as strong as Gilbert. So strong enough to replace a dead council member. I also already texted Tyson, who&#39;s elated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Green has agreed to just pay out lump sums for his pups, 3 million each, and an Omega should be here with those checks this afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It will be refused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He will pay *each* month. I won&#39;t let him &#39;forget&#39; about his pups. If this happens again, I&#39;m going to get him neutered. That man&#39;s probably making Arviel jealous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled, waking myself up a bit, while my mate and Eternya did the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter woke me up I&#39;d have to settle for a shorter nap than I&#39;d planned. I said I&#39;d watch the boys today anyway, but thankfully they snored on my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also caught the bed ablaze from my damn candle&#39;s flicker, however Tyson shared how to repair the area by trading magical energy for matter. As a demigod, I am not allowed to break the laws of reality fully. Like, I can&#39;t make something that doesn&#39;t exist from *nothing* like grandfather or the Three Princes, however, I *can* exchange my magic for materials.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think he said the conversion was a soul&#39;s worth of energy to repair a house my size.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are they doing down there?&#34; I asked with a chuckle. The boys were taking a nap on my chest, but as soon as I woke up, they were ready to go. They followed me with a little bounce, tails in the air following papa, not wondering off to play with the ton of toys left out for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all they are teething. There&#39;s still no guarantee I&#39;ll wake up to having unburned shoes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We went home so I could protect my pack. There&#39;s nothing personal with Tyson anymore, but my mortals hold my priority. Misfit was built for the thrown away, forgotten, lost, and discarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, I&#39;m starting to get the nickname of The Goatherder. If it keeps up, it will become a real title in 20 years or so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basically, I&#39;ll become stronger when protecting my homewoerld.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Way to go master!&#34; Laughed Eternya. &#34;My Lord Get Up and come see this! Baby We&#39;re on the Front Page Too! Look!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;..no.. No NOOO!!!&#34; She yelled while he laughed. &#34;My Lady Don&#39;t Look!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;LOOK!&#34; He yelled laughing. &#34;You&#39;re blurred.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;oh but Still!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Wow you&#39;re certainly passionate.&#34; Said Willow. &#34;So, everyone&#39;s just on his Altar screwing their brains out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For *6* more days. I came up for some normal air. Holy shit.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take me Out BACK AND LAY ME ON THE RING!&#34; Screamed Elinore.. Eternya Laughed a hearty chuckle. I resisted facepalming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is Exciting! HA!&#34; There were texting sounds. &#34;The Rotted One&#39;s Jealous. Fuck off *bug-boy!!*&#34; he laughed. I could hear Eternya Squeal like a little schoolgirl down there as he laughed, and Elinore flipped out. &#34;Look At Eskaal The Fucking Virgin! He&#39;s just standing there with a Fucking Clipboard AH! Hahaha!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my Gods! I&#39;m SO GLAD I DIDN&#39;T GO!!!!!&#34; Squealed Willow.</p>
