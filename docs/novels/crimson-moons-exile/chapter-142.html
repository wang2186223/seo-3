                <p>The Horned One</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both looked at each other in disbelief, but she was owed It seemed she meant to collect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I *knew* I shouldn&#39;t have let her sit in my chair but she looked so cute on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held his face in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;LIKE *YOU* can pull ANY tone with me!&#34; She screamed. &#34;You literally made me without anyone&#39;s consent, then you get mad when he didn&#39;t want me as a gift! AND YOU of *all* people had the nerve to be upset that someone you MADE AS A FUCKING PARTY FAVOR DECIDED WHO TO LET JUMP IN HER BOX!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dear that&#39;s enou-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slapped me too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. It actually hurt..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was channeling my throne!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will fix this.&#34; She hissed. &#34;You both will fucking fix this or so help me I WILL turn the realms inside out. Do. Not. Test. ME.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have to-&#34; Arviel&#39;s belligerent attitude was *changed*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;YOU WILL FUCKING FIX THIS!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face morphed into an amalgamation of multiple animals as she snarled in his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her flesh was made unstable, and as hot as this was, I didn&#39;t know what to do about it She&#39;s only ever been my mate The only thing I could think of was &#39;the dark side of the moon&#39; when I looked at her summon claws as long as swords.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all she was made with no weapon so now she made her own</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her robes before they ripped became a beautiful red, black flowered kimono. The black jacket trailed to the floor, and the wide sleeves ended at her knees. The entire jacket had a haunted forest depicted on the bottom, and there were full moons on either sleeve; both of which were red.Her silver hair was black, but faded to red as well</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d never seen her do this Not even for herself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not stand up for herself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>but how could she back then? As a lesser goddess captive, the smallest desire for her to die could kill her I bet he had barriers around himself to shield her from his anger then, so he could keep her hostage</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even that was my fault I should have made her come to my realm If I&#39;d have commanded it back then, Xaxas would have been born in the castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I&#39;d have been no better than him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She became a personification of the night itself. She had bat wings and blades were her claws, being shaped like a bear&#39;s Great horned owl feathers were overtop the webbing, while she had a black and red pattern A wolf&#39;s head and torso complimented owl talons. This would have been fun for *me* if she also wasn&#39;t mad at me. Though she had no horns. She was beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was thin and elegant. Her silhouette was of an owl feathered wolf with owl tufts as horns. Her tail was nearly as long as her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her legs were long and thin like a deer&#39;s, but the claws were silver swords.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew this would happen, and I let it to fuck them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know how to fix this.&#34; I said pulling her close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;LET ME GO!!!&#34; She screamed and I held her. &#34;It isn&#39;t fair!&#34; She hit my chest until she clawed my robes. &#34;.When you were gone. He never once added to my troublesHumblon did his job, and *you killed him for it.*&#34; She chewed it until she changed back, and I used the scraps of my robes to cover her. I could make more, but I really did need to fix this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lulliba is right dear That&#39;s why I tried stopping you Humblon, even if he was brought back would never forgive you.&#34; Said Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.He will He Fuck. Why&#39;d you let me do it?&#34; Arviel demanded. &#34;I can&#39;t blame you it&#39;s our nature to be this way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, and I should have been better.&#34; I said feeling like shit</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lulliba wouldn&#39;t look at me Her red eyes now cried blood, as every moon on every world was likely either red, or would eclipse soon</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wouldn&#39;t even look at me She even contemplated our bond as did Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t lose you little mate. Even as the Only Moon Goddess you are still too weak to use such power.&#34; I said unable to heal the soul burns already blistering She&#39;s going to really hurt for doing this, and I&#39;m going to feel like shit for forever. &#34;Please wish it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will wish for Nothing.&#34; Lulliba said angrily. &#34;You both did this; *You* resolve this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. Damn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;ll do it for free.&#34; I said to appease my most precious. &#34;Arviel, if I bring him back as a god, he doesn&#39;t want to do it anymore. We&#39;re going to have to make a new Mercy, and the old one will have to be mortal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;IF you do that, then Humblon will eventually die again, and the new mercy will not want to do it&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We could fuse them together into a two headed-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Everyone disagreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nobody Fucking Quits because they don&#39;t want to do their Fucking Job!&#34; Screamed my eldest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxashevaal had Humblon by the throat, and stuffed him in his body like you&#39;re trying to put on a sock The powers were grabbed off the table and shoved down Humblon&#39;s throat as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humblon gasped for air. &#34;Master please!&#34; He begged. &#34;Don&#39;t&#39; take me from her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh? Why would I do that?&#34; He still held the soul by the scruff. &#34;Nayamya right?&#34; he picked up the dust and remade the mortal, though some of her was lost, so she was a centimeter smaller.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humblon cradled her sleeping form as I do my Lulliba. how could I not see it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not his mate, but he cared for her as one. A platonic love</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You would do that Judgement?&#34; He asked. &#34;You even kept her the way I made her&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A million times.&#34; Said my son. &#34;You both have 10 seconds to explain why Mercy&#39;s tears blessed my altar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were owed for his actions. To do NOTHING would ruin the alignment.&#34; Said Arviel, a little flustered and agitated from being called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the Judge, he was not informed on such a large action so he was owed as we were..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was owed an explanation, and he wasn&#39;t satisfied with our answer</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And instead, you both got Bagel Killed. You made me Fucking Lose My Streak to a Mortal.&#34; He hissed, referring to a shooting game he plays with my nephew, War.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; We both asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO NOT BAGEL!!!!&#34; Screamed Lulliba.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like that lil&#39; scamp.&#34; Said Lia. &#34;If you don&#39;t fix this with him, you&#39;re not coming home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you better not try to replace her with someone else&#39;s either.&#34; Growled Lulliba, and they fist bumped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. Where did my butterfly go..? I didn&#39;t like having a tiny *vicious* tiger</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think that&#39;s fair.&#34; Said Xaxashevaal smugly. His grin at us, me especially, could eat shit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I take it that was one of the Charred family pets.&#34; Asked Arviel, and the girls nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lulliba sends me videos of her mortals. I think that one is my favorite. She&#39;s so cheeky.&#34; Giggled Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A black werewolf playfully chased the little brown pit mix because she had his pants. It thinks the former crown prince is her &#39;papa&#39;. My heart sank as I still couldn&#39;t find her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It calls them mama and papa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***I&#39;m fucked.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m so fucked. *Why did I do this to myself?* *I just had to get what I was owed.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.This was much too cute to be sending around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They have *mortal attachment* to this creature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yeah, you sent me that one yesterday.&#34; Said Arviel, inwardly freaking out with me... [Zuviel we&#39;re cooked as the fucking sacrificial turkey on Thankful Day.] he said so only I would understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Fried as an eggbound hen on Sunday.] I said back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*But When did they get a damn group chat?!*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The eldest living mortal blood of her Herold was that wolf. I realize that now Kaiden Charred, Kaizen&#39;s other grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. She really . *Really* likes that line. SHIT.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know if I *could* fix it Purgatory was down Hell&#39;s gates are flooded I looked for a dog I&#39;d never paid attention to, but I couldn&#39;t cheat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I don&#39;t find it, nor Arviel, we&#39;ll Have to keep looking</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s bad enough I got in hot water for Humblon</p>
                
                
                
                <p>or the countless trillions Not everyone or everything got back up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Double Shit. This is why I don&#39;t do things on impulse. All it took was 2 seconds Just that for 81% of all the worlds to be shaken to their foundations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know how much of an earful Harmony gave me? I should have Never Gifted her.&#34; He growled in a rant while I still looked. &#34;I see your face. I think she&#39;s gone. I had to trade the dog of Kaiden to reset the entire planet because you two were involved. You&#39;re Welcome.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am so thankful I&#39;m not one planet anymore.&#34; Said Lia holding her forehead, and my mate did too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Humblon you already have a Herold, so I now place my judgment on this mortal. God&#39;s magic has touched this one, so here. I&#39;m making the damn mate bond myself.&#34; Xaxashevaal waved his hand. &#34;The goddess of Fucking I Don&#39;t Know, Uh The Goddess of Forgiveness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like that.&#34; Said Humblon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s your wife now; all apologies go to her. Since she&#39;s your wife, she&#39;s protected. Now she&#39;s a Minor goddess that doesn&#39;t even need worship, and she can stay your High Priestess. Now stop making fucking drama.&#34; He pointed a clawed finger at us. &#34;You&#39;re all wasting my fucking time. Oh, and every mortal who can&#39;t come back, even the animals must be compensated 1 gold for every day they should have lived.&#34; Growled my son. I was proud as any father could ever be even though the chastising was meant for me too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me brother I-&#34; Humblon cut off Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Humblon.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;Do not let an apology crease your lips your highness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was *cold*. The glare given to me by my mate was just as</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t either.&#34; I growled. I was more displeased at letting my little Lulliba reshape herself in anger</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nobody Fucking Asked You For It.&#34; Xaxas said on the wind, since he disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You little- you know what. I&#39;ll be the bigger god and accept that.&#34; I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I found the soul of the little dog to return I realized something:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so Hellbent, pun not intended, on being compensated now I must compensate more than what I was given.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So if I&#39;d have left well enough alone, none of this would have happenedAll this took was 2 mortal seconds What a mess I&#39;ve made.</p>
