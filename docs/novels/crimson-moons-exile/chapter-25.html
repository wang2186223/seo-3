                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped awake in my husband&#39;s arms The sun was out and an alarm clock by the bed said 7am. I took a shower and when I got out, I realized I was out of shirts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put on Kaizen&#39;s, a powder blue one, and black leggings. He snored like a baby. I left him to it. Everyone downstairs, both old and new faces, were chatting happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve I&#39;ve never been invited into a home before.&#34; Said someone who sounded. Wild. &#34;Don&#39;t get me wrong I know Of technology, I just never used it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gruff growly voice told me that he was probably a werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;d you get on this continent if you&#39;re from Africa? I&#39;ve never heard of lycans being able to stand being around people&#34; Asked someone I didn&#39;t recognize. I got to the bottom of the stairs, and everyone waved, except the man who was speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I stowed away on a cargo ship with my mother I lost control. I tried so hard too. I ate the crew, and later jumped out and swam to shore before more humans came. I believe that area&#39;s called Bostyn now.&#34; He said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why of all names, Gilbert?&#34; asked Rick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because Gillitus is too strange.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is. How old are you?&#34; Asked Ace. &#34;You don&#39;t scent as old as that name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m 84, though my mother had been around since the war.A shame she was killed  on the ship....&#34; He said stoically. That must have been a sore spot. &#34;I am the last of my bloodline. Father was killed before we left, and mother as just a regular wolf. She stood no chance against the superstitious crew. One of them had silver bullets. To be fair if they wouldn&#39;t&#39; have hurt her, I might have stayed myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe here you can find new family&#34; I said interrupting, but he didn&#39;t seem to mind. He took deep sniffs, and growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kind words from . My Luna.&#34; He said, kneeling on one knee. &#34;I came to this village because I thought no humans would be here. But with a supernatural mark on you my instincts do not fire.&#34; He said standing tall. &#34;I believe the other &#39;humans&#39; I scent are vampires.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to be as tall as Kaizen&#39;s &#39;short&#39; form but to be fair, all shapeshifters had enormous frames Other supernaturals too if I was being honest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, no growling at Luna.&#34; Said Ace. &#34;Alpha made Me Beta, because you, nor Jack would be able to handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me.&#34; He bowed to his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No it&#39;s fine.&#34; I smiled. &#34;I&#39;ll make pancakes and bacon. My treat.&#34; I offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all looked like I offered them gold bricks, but Valery, one of the women who came with us protested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Luna. We are much too low. Let us make You a meal.&#34; She smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Want to do this this place almost reminds me of a Way bigger version of my old home I figure if I can never be with my family again I can also make new ones.&#34; I said going to the gas stove. I turned it on, and pulled out the bacon I saw yesterday, and some eggs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s an old cast iron waffle maker.&#34; Offered Ace. He rummaged around and Rick got dough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will stand watch.&#34; Said Gilbert. He seemed so serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s safe here.&#34; Said Ace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;is it?&#34; He asked suspiciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to run anymore Gilbert.&#34; I said over my shoulder</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there as if he didn&#39;t believe those words He looked at me as if there was a condition, or &#39;but&#39; to that statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then is there something else I could do?&#34; Gilbert asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could come with me to the store.&#34; Said one of the female werewolves. I didn&#39;t know her name, but I knew she rode in the bus with Ace. They wound up donating it to the local school here, even though they didn&#39;t need it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; he said leaving with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think Harley&#39;s shooting her shot?&#34; Asked Rick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean after last night&#39;s fight, Yeah.&#34; Ace snickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fight?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha put him in his place, but more importantly, he drank his blood. His majesty owns him.&#34; Said Ace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He What?&#34; I asked yelling a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s why he&#39;s probably so tired. He didn&#39;t use his powers, but fuck did fur fly.&#34; Said Rick. &#34;I can&#39;t believe both of them are healed and walking around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey can you man the bacon station?&#34; I asked Valery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of Course Luna.&#34; She ran walked over while I went upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the magic he warned me of but I almost wondered did he do that to me too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, that couldn&#39;t be right. I didn&#39;t drink any blood, I can&#39;t even scratch him. And he only bit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In our room, Kaizen was snoring with his mouth open. His horns, fangs, and claws were out as he snored. He even dangled off the bedbecause he was his &#39;full&#39; size.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone else would be intimidated, but I wanted to get him up to ask him about all this. He also looked like he was sweating a lot</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my hand on his forehead He was burning up. He was always hot, but I didn&#39;t know if he could get sick. I pet him between his horns. He was asleep on his back, with his head propped up on multiple pillows. He was also in just sweats and some black socks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned in and kissed him on the forehead. He looked so peaceful, yet he looked so flush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rah!&#34; he yelled in my face without growling but it still scared me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AH! Kaizen you Dick!&#34; I screamed slapping his chest, but he picked me up, and put me on his lap while he laid there.  He was hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put me down Right now!&#34; I yelled flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He growled &#34;No.&#34; He said squeezing my butt I could feel his claws flexing as he did so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A Normal person might have been afraid of this but it was kinda hot</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll. I&#39;ll kick your ass.&#34; I warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm go ahead.&#34; He chuckled sitting up.  He kissed me on the forehead. &#34;I&#39;m alright little mate of mine. Thank you for worrying about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t see how I wouldn&#39;t. I heard you gave a werewolf your blood to drink.&#34; I said leaving out the other part of it. That I worried a Little bit that he&#39;d done the same to me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. He is bound to me now. It means that he won&#39;t be able to disobey. He&#39;s not a regular werewolf, he&#39;s a lycan. He walks on two legs when he shifts, kind of like the wolves you see in the movies. I did it because lycans oftentimes cannot control themselves, and I Cannot have the only reason I&#39;m doing all this in the first place get hurt.&#34; He said responding to both parts of the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright come have breakfast.&#34; I said but he bucked under me. It sent a shockwave of lust with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will return to this position later.&#34; He said sitting on the edge of the bed, taking me with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wrapped my legs around his waist, and he kissed me passionately. It was demanding. He took charge of that kiss he grinded himself against me, and I could feel his cock poke me thankfully our clothes were in between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moaned when he stopped kissing me, only to lick my mark. I gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you want more.&#34; He said huskily. It was times like this, that I remembered he was a Prince</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do&#34; I mumbled. I bit my lip, rhythmically mimicking my husband&#39;s motions. His cock throbbed with want and the friction made me horny even through our clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss we got a situation down here!&#34; Yelled Ace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh for Fuck&#39;s Sake!&#34; He yelled. He grunted, kissing me gently. &#34;Please stay up here.&#34; He said pressing his forehead to mine. &#34;I will return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Kaizen, Keep your Dog on a better leash!&#34; Screamed someone. It sounded like they were male.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lord Kaizen let me kill him!&#34; Growled Gilbert. &#34;You want a Dog? *I&#39;ll* show you a fucking Dog!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put him down!&#34; He yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going down too.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both went to see thankfully no blood, but Gilbert did have a man with elf ears by the throat. On seeing me, he bowed, and growled while he did it. It made the other wolves growl as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;Elf or not, whatever he said, I made them pack too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, your highness.&#34; Said the elf rubbing his red neck when he was released Gilbert could probably pop his head off..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep your Mouth to yourself Eugene. I won&#39;t save you again.&#34; Said my husband with crossed arms. &#34;No one put their hands on anyone for Words. I think we should all have more self-control than that, supernatural or Not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Alpha.&#34; Said many of them with a little anger I wonder what Did Eugene say but I could probably guess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was likely either about Kaizen, or me. Likely me to be fair. The way he looked at me was similar to the way the other elves looked at the Elvish village. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising, nor anything new. Since I&#39;m human, I feel like I&#39;d see more from those who were nobles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Non shifters, like magic casters, often think little of us.&#34; Said Kaizen, sitting on the couch. One of the children, like a 3 or 4 year old little girl jumped into his lap and he put it on cartoons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Up-up!&#34; She shouted. Her hair was as silver as a coin. She had no fear of my mate all smiles and excited bouncing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright little one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry Alpha!&#34; Yelled a woman who was on Ace&#39;s bus, but Kaizen shook his head. She was coming to get her kid, but he didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eh, y&#39;all go ahead and cook. I used to have pup duty all the time.&#34; He said casually. &#34;And I won&#39;t share what he said. Swear words shouldn&#39;t be said around pups this small, but I doubt he&#39;ll say it again.&#34; He grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was swarmed by more Very small children, since the show was My Littlest Horsey. They giggled and sat around him, on him, and at his feet. It was really cute. I wouldn&#39;t expect a demon prince to like kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is no secret that when I die, I will be a general of Hell, but little mate, you&#39;ll see eventually that not all who serve the Dark One are as dark as we&#39;re made out to be.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;Hey no biting!&#34; He said being chomped on by a small kid, one who was originally crawling. They couldn&#39;t hurt him, but he chastised anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind reading was probably the only way that he knew his name too now that I thought of it, but afterwards it did calm down. Everyone who didn&#39;t help me went to restock supplies. I knew Kaizen couldn&#39;t have grease, so I found beef in the fridge, and made the biggest slab of it, so he wouldn&#39;t be hungry.</p>
