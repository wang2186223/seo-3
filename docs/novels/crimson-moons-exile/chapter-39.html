                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would likely not be seen as king, being defeated by me if I won Yet that fact did not stop us. It couldn&#39;t. I couldn&#39;t be his Beta and back down or go along with him anymore.. Not with Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[You could have surrendered, and I would have freed your mark mate.] He growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[She&#39;s my true mate.] I snapped at him, barely missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[I Just can&#39;t see the gods doing that.] he snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Ther&#39;s a lot you can&#39;t fucking see!] I said ramming him with all the force I could. We bounced off each other, shaking the loose dirt and mud around us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our horns became locked with another bone shattering bash and neither of us could get free. We pushed each other, trying to gore the other brotherHe was trying to break my neck so bad that I wouldn&#39;t be able to heal It wasn&#39;t a bad idea, if only for the fact that he was slowly being overpowered. The grip I held was slightly better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That clawed grip in the loose dirt was my only chance. If I slip, he will kill me. I felt myself losing control I felt myself not really fighting the primal instincts that slowly welled up inside I would be a monster for my mate A Monster the Other Monsters feared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ceiling shattered, and there was a small earthquake that came with it. It was all so fast I couldn&#39;t see who or what had done that, but we found out nearly instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!] Screamed Grace, headbutting us both at the same time. The impact of her equal sized frame forced us to stagger in opposite directions, freeing us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. When did she grow?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[GET THE FUCK OUT THE WAY!] Tyson screamed, but behind her was a giant golden dragon. He was so tall his horns would have touched the now shattered ceiling. He had to have his head slightly bowed to fit</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dragon growled something in draconic, but the only one who understood him, was just Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyson shifted, pointing a finger at him. &#34;I don&#39;t understand draconic, but Lord Aureus, you Trespass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aureus shifted, becoming a golden-tan skinned, golden haired man. &#34;For my mate&#39;s happiness, you have no idea how far I&#39;ll go to see her smile.&#34; Aureus snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move.&#34; He sneered, though Aureus was obviously not intimidated by his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Childish Boy.&#34; The King of the Sky spat. &#34;How many of My people killed their own on mass! How many sided with the master, sundering all life, all living things, with no remorse or regard for anything unbranded by them during the war?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it is childish to want justice, If you want to fight me, so be it.&#34; He summoned his weapon from the depths of his soul a glowing red double-edged short-sword and shield. It held grandfather&#39;s crest on it and all our weapons pulsed in each other&#39;s presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had my bowIt too glowed red but fuck I was so tired I don&#39;t know if I could even draw it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace had her staff. &#34;I will not let you fight my mate.&#34; She snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aureus summoned a fan. &#34;I will not allow my mate to be marred.&#34; It looked to be made of gold, like his scales. Aureus was a golden dragon made of literal gold if I remember right it very well may have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This fight was going to be bloodier than I doubt anyone could imagine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they won&#39;t do it I will. I prayed to grandfather that someone stop this before we clash. I don&#39;t see any mortals living should we all attack each other. using our powers....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should evacuate the mortals.&#34; I sneered. &#34;I doubt you want innocent lives on Your hands as well. Believe me when I tell you it weighs on your heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tyson, you go too far.&#34; Growled Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think you can take 3 demigods?&#34; Asked Aureus. I believe the Wind Goddess, a lesser goddess was his mother His abilities wouldn&#39;t be as powerful as we three children of Bryson yet at the same time, it would depend on his skill too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You would impede another king&#39;s judgment?&#34; Tyson snarled. &#34;All I&#39;ve done is Try to be a Good King! You think I Want to kill my Fucking Identical Brother?! You Think I Want to feel the Cuts I give him to see my mate so ashamed of me.&#34; He looked down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; It&#39;s obvious that you&#39;re not meant to do this. As a formal request from one king to another, Pardon him.&#34; Demanded Aureus. &#34;You three share a connection that cannot be compared to even mates that it was taken from you three, yet you Still feel his pain Pain *You* inflicted on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All four of us were silent. &#34;To go without punishment is a spit in my victim&#39;s face.&#34; I mumbled. &#34;I wish to continue. I will not have peace until I take it for myself it seems.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do as well.&#34; Said Tyson. &#34;If either of you get in the way, I will not hold back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both charged at the same time. I&#39;d use my bow as a sword it would be able to withstand blows it would only break if I died. Grace charged as well with her staff, and the fan Aureus held became a katana length bladed weapon but none of our blows connected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the whoosh of the Realm King came the desire to vomit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;ve seen Enough.&#34; Said King Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was not my uncle in this moment He was the offended God of Judgment. His power could be seen radiating off him in puffs of red flame and black smokeHis flaming crown floated between ram&#39;s horns double the size of mine. He was his true height, being over 10 feet tall, looking down at us as if we were disobedient children. Father was here, yet, he said nothing, still in the viewing booth. I knew him for him not to have said anything, even now he knew this was going to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a wave of his hand, we were on our knees. &#34;Everyone is so ready to fight.&#34; He said in the silence. Not a head was lifted my uncle ruled this world and all on it Whatever he decided, we would have no choice but to obey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With in a blink of an eye. To my horror my mate was in front of the All King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know where Kaizen stands. Let&#39;s see where You stand mortal.&#34; He said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever you rule sire, please punish me.&#34; I said looking at her stare at him in fear. She couldn&#39;t move, nor speak I&#39;d seen that spell before. It was passively done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-------Willow------</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there, towering over them all as they stood behind him I&#39;d never seen so much fear in not only the eyes of my mate, but also his identical siblings</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What should I do hmm? What do *you* think should happen?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was imposing He had to be over ten feet tall an impossibility Even being around Kaizen so much  That was nothing compared to him even Kaizen&#39;s father felt passive and neutral the one they all kneeled to He felt like I was speaking to the physical embodiment of power. I&#39;d seen pictures of him too He was the son of the Adversary The Horned Lion. The God of Judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want this to end without anyone being hurt.&#34; I mumbled...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh that&#39;s Very good wording. So, if I said Kaizen would be imprisoned a hundred years for every death, you&#39;d be happy?&#34; He asked, grinning sinisterly. He was always one for fun and games but I couldn&#39;t tell if he was serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; I screamed. &#34;Please Just I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair he&#39;s punished at all. He isn&#39;t a prince anymore, he has no permanent home since we&#39;re hunted like animals Everywhere we go, ultimately, we&#39;re met with suspicion.  All for werewolves who knowingly broke the law and made the chain reaction happen in the first place.&#34; I said shedding tears. &#34;I&#39;m Tired. I Just want Flippin&#39; Peace!&#34; I screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could tell Tyson from my mate now that we were close He looked ashamed of his rulings. He should be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>King Xaxas snapped his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hear me mortals.&#34; He boomed, and there wasn&#39;t a head lifted, not even mine it was not my will to do so, but I wouldn&#39;t fight whatever this was. &#34;Hell has no real sense of time. A minute here can feel like a decade there. It all depends on the crime. What my nephew did was in defense of his mate, His True Mate. Any of you in this room if you had the power he has, and your loved one was in danger, you&#39;d act first, ask questions later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He peered at the crowd</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I rule that Kaizen be punished for 25 hours within the Layer of Murder at the discretion of Slah-hesh&#39;Rrah, which will feel like 25 years. That&#39;s about as far as I&#39;ll go. He&#39;s pardoned, his status renewed and when he returns, the blood-servants he made will be returned to him, along with the last living member of the House of Finnand-Grisham.&#34; He vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I cannot go over or against the All-King.&#34; King Tyson said walking away. &#34;Whatever the princess needs, give.&#34; He said referring to me, gesturing my general direction</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It left me in the middle of the blood-soaked battlefield with his sister and her mate. &#34;What a way to meet.&#34; She smiled. She was the same height as Kaizen I felt like an ant around all of them. &#34;I&#39;m Grace.&#34; She smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow.&#34; I said shaking her hand. This was awkward strange. Her mate hesitated to touch me like she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Aureus. I&#39;m glad I flew as fast as I did there&#39;s no telling what would have happened if we were a moment later.&#34; He said stiffly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you I think you two were the catalyst that got someone who could stop this to do something&#34;  I said with a sinking feeling in my stomach. &#34;Why can&#39;t I feel him at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not dead, but your connection is likely blocked for your sake.&#34; Said Grace.</p>
