                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lied about being fine, gods I felt weak from shooting across the sky like that but it wasn&#39;t hard to play off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish to speak to you in private.&#34; Said grandfather, posed as a doctor</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tacky getup fooled all but it seemed me Even father, nor my uncles seemed to notice. They were outside, sharing beers, making the demonic circle to summon Tyson, and weaving it in a way that it didn&#39;t make a permanent portal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow it&#39;s Dr. Sampson!&#34; Said a random wolf. Many thought he was here because of the news I got a few hours ago I knew better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was 11:59. He probably was here to see Tyson&#39;s arrival to the land of the living himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow, would you mind being outside a bit?&#34; I asked. We were still in the living room. Everyone wanted to talk with me, or see that everything was fine. Mortals didn&#39;t need to know that peace was about as thin as a silk thread right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked with him to my office, and he sat in the guest chair. He even crossed his leg high, as important men do, and leaned back in the recliner Uncle Xaxas left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In private before I sat in my chair, I kneeled to the King, and he patted my head between the horns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rise, 1st General Kaizen.&#34; Said grandfather sternly He held no passive smile today Yet, His &#39;mortal&#39; avatar sat there, still covered in dust He didn&#39;t use it often, preferring to come here himself. It was a puppet he controlled from his realm, looking exactly like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What orders do you have for me?&#34; I asked In all my life I&#39;d never been called my title by him But why was I not 2nd?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thankfully none, merely preparation., and ceremony.&#34; He stood. And when I blinked, I was in hell</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t in his throne room I was on a grand stone platform that held 4 grand thrones, and 4 small ones next to his, though his was the biggest, and in the middle. He was his true height I went to his ankles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The black stone platform made him look even bigger. The thrones of everyone accommodated people no taller than 12 feet yet his matched his size. In front, down at least a thousand stairs as an endless army of dragons and demons Great bat vampyr flew in the sky Grandfather was the King of all things darkEvery world, every single one held souls that belonged to him, over the course of Everything, since the beginning</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could only assume the same was for those of Haven</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That your mortal mind thinks you have seen my trueness is amusing.&#34; He rumbled He did not sound the same And he had armor That was new  It was black iron. The individual scales were carved by him... There was so much detail..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t notice Tyson until now. He looked firm, yet still himself He glowed a light, pale yellow, unlike me who held a black aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The endless sea of demons were below the platform, kneeled with their swords in the black dirt. Tyson. Looked melancholy and I was allowed to kneel with him. And Grace. What the literal fuck was happening</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blood of my Blood, little souls of my son. It was I who made you, and I who molded you. Horned Wolves of Hell, receive your titles, Kaizen, the Swift One, Grace, the Powerful One, Tyson, The Holy One I make you 1,2, and 3, your children will be 4, 5, and 6. With this distinction, you may now teleport here at will With ranks so high, I can pass your undying nature to your sons.. No more dream traveling, no more petty, small trinkets and bobbles.&#34; He snarled. &#34;Arviel has his tricks&#39; I have mine too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your highness. I am not the first born I do not wish to cheat my brother.&#34; I said silently I knew my brother Tyson wouldn&#39;t care, but I still didn&#39;t think it right not to at least mention it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is First on Urth. First born, Now a King, and so on. Grace is a Queen of my son&#39;s peopleThey hold mighty titles and blessingsyet you are Just Kaizen. Only An Alpha That is not fair.&#34; He said summoning a massive trident.. It shook the ground, and I can&#39;t lie being the height of an armored ankle made me think twice about saying anything else. &#34;You are Just as Capable, yet, I will not let you all share Number One. Why should you be without?&#34; He asked. &#34;Why should I not bless you too? They have glory and fame, yet most of your journey has been second fiddle, vagabond, and fugitive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; I said silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know your hearts too. Tyson You were meant to be a holy beast. I knew that the day I pulled you out your mother&#39;s belly. I changed your fur color, but not your soul. You belong up high, yet must serve below.&#34; He said shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As I said grandfather I willingly do so. I don&#39;t want to work with a man who only wanted me because I was deemed useful.&#34; Said Tyson. &#34;It is why I kneel. I know where I belong. I don&#39;t care about being some grand holy white wolf with feathers and such. I care that my son and nephews would have to fight me. I care that I would be surrounded by beings who only want me for my unholy blade, praising me in public and hate me in secret. You have never wronged me All you&#39;ve ever done is love us, even though we are only mortals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t wrong No matter what he did for us or to us We were not even ants to one so high And being so young, we would have to grow into these titles. I could not stand against Uriel right now; he had many years on me, not that I wanted to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not wish to lead either.&#34; Said Grace. &#34;I know I could, but all my life, I have had to deal with proving myself finding myself I don&#39;t wish to spend eternity continuing that I don&#39;t want to have a position so high that my son and nephews are led by a leader who doesn&#39;t want to do it I Know you can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You rallied us, even though we were injured. Plus, I&#39;m pretty sure this is done for Willow, Aureus, and Samira to be safe.&#34; Said Tyson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I take position as 1st general.&#34; I said proudly They did not want it, nor I, but they were right</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then Rise, First High Commander of Armageddon. Rise my Second High Commander of Calamity. and my Third: Extinction. Do you see now why You are Third Tyson?&#34; He asked, finally letting the smallest smile creep across his face</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I will have the compassion to end life painlessly If I am to do what needs to be Done come the end should it ever happen I know I will not let them die in pain and fear.&#34;  He stood proudly, as we were allowed to rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel like my real purpose was revealed I knew now that my powers were not able to be tapped into, but should war be declared The arrows I shoot now would probably destroy countries</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; He said looking up. &#34;Your grandmother is so upset she will not even look at me, that our grandchildren are titled so soon But without them Arviel would still try to steal one, and kill the others.. You two are of no use to him. Yet he wishes to claim Tyson as blood Now. Bastard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thunder rumbled with his sour mood I knew grandmother wasn&#39;t on her throne because she cried for us. She was a Lesser Goddess. Whatever grandfather rules, it is so, and ultimately, no one has any say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xaxashevaal works hard with his threat to obliterate the solar system should we fight . So long as he lives on Urth, I will NOT deploy you three What a mess. All this for a soul, one that was paid for with just compensation..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>---Willow----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The laugh of Xaxas outside was almost infectious, but he&#39;d kidnapped me to hang out with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you going to name your son?&#34; Asked Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megatram.&#34; I said just to see what he&#39;d do, and he laughed, while Bryson and Asanguis facepalmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t encourage him.&#34; Said Bryson shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always liked the name Bart.&#34; Said Asanguis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not making your kid before I do.&#34; Complained Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who said I would? Father said he&#39;d make mine too.&#34; Asanguis said with a smug smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not fair.&#34; Xaxas complained. &#34;I want to be lazy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unlike You, I don&#39;t have any experience making souls brother.&#34; Said Asanguis. &#34;And I Really don&#39;t want my first to be my own kid.Or anyone else&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their mates were with Samira it was 11:58. Kaizen was talking to a doctor about my pregnancy already but he looked so uncanny. Almost like the Princes of Hell</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Said Xaxas, looking at me curiously. &#34;I didn&#39;t think he&#39;d unlock them so soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t he tell us?&#34; Said Bryson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because he knew we&#39;d talk him out of it.&#34; Said Xaxas. &#34;I don&#39;t sense Hurculian, nor 5 other of his bastards either. I can bet money Arviel is shitting bricks that father stole one of his titles for Tyson&#39;s sake.  This shit is giving me a headache.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Preparation.&#34; Said Xaxas I ruined the mood it seemed. &#34;I said if they fight, I&#39;m destroying this solar system. That includes Lia, his full god sons, and his halves Like there&#39;s a million bastards floating around from him, but there&#39;s only one wife, and one bloodline from said wife. Same with mother&#34; He said the last part quietly. &#34;Father holds no bastards but I don&#39;t imagine us living too long after I do something like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You Wouldn&#39;t.&#34; Said Asanguis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am the Judge There&#39;s a Reason why my god&#39;s symbol is scales, and they weigh the Light And Night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But All we worked for all the death we dealt&#34; Asanguis paused. &#34;Brother what of our mates. They will not live if those who share One mournRetaliation would come for the Three of Us on Both ends.&#34; Asanguis said this sadly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant me too. There&#39;s no way as the Horned One&#39;s grandson that Kaizen, nor me would live. Or anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas&#39;s eyes weren&#39;t black at the moment... I could tell his irises were actually a very dark red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If there is no Urth, there is no Moon. If there is no planet and moon, then there are no Lia, nor LullibaNor a Gate to Keep Hell Below. Just. I need some air.&#34; He said disappearing.</p>
