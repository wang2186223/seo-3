                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boys were getting big. They were 5 months now. Their little eyes were mostly open, but they didn&#39;t see well yet. Their crawling was almost walking, but their feet weren&#39;t under them proper yet. Their &#39;run&#39; was still only a little faster than walking speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We age so slowly, like humans, because of what we are We&#39;re helpless at this age and will be for a long while. About 13 was when dad took us hunting proper. Before that it was mostly us playing around, and him doing all the heavy lifting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jackpot!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;..And we&#39;re CLOSED.&#34; I yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was 1pm. I closed early today. I got up and put the sign on the door, while my boys were up to no good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Ma!] Yelled Vexterios. He was pulling on my socks every step. He wanted to singe them while his brother was just as mischievous, cheekily running off with a piece of crumpled paper. He thought it was important  and preceded to try to catch it ablaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[No!] She yipped at Aristaeus, who wagged his tail so hard he may as well fly. I held a laugh It would only encourage them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was caught by Eternya. &#34;Diana is in labor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t take Herculian&#39;s call. I texted him that I was busy and I didn&#39;t check back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He told me that Diana was tired of being pregnant, and fae can just. Birth when they&#39;re ready. I&#39;ll never understand mammals.&#34; Eternya said shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not normal.&#34; Said Willow. &#34;Like It&#39;s more than fine to be confused.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My people lay eggs. It&#39;s not that difficult. I mean it *is* but I hope you get what I mean. You shit out an egg, sit on it, it hatches, and your chicks can fly by 3 days and can hunt by the end of the week We only stick around until they&#39;re big enough to fend for themselvesWhat confuses me is how long everything takes with mammals. Fae babes are more in line with firebirdsOur chicks don&#39;t really *Get* an early childhood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left after that, though Elinore looked a little confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t speak of it, but he&#39;s close to the last of his people. He&#39;s the last true pureblood He was ordered by the Realm King to kill his kind all after they sided with the other Kings.&#34; I said to clarify his statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that part I am a follower of his father. He ordered him an outlaw, and we hid quite a few eggs during the War My husband is responsible for his own loneliness His own people fear him, his father disowned him, and his children were rebels. All this speak of children and new life irks him, because I know deep down he wants children, but he&#39;s troubled. I&#39;ll take my leave.&#34; She bowed, thinking that she trauma-dumped on us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you&#39;re fine. See if he&#39;s ok.&#34; Said Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eternya didn&#39;t just end his people, he&#39;s scorched entire countries.&#34; I told Willow. &#34;Now that the war is over, he atones for his crimes, but what is done cannot be undone Where his people are, he cannot follow, as they reside in his father&#39;s afterlife And those who remain are only the children of all those slain people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life means little to one who cannot die</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It means little when it was his job to extinguish them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day such a task will be mine, but at least it won&#39;t be *here* It will be another world, some disobedient planet the gods grow tired of</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen?&#34; She asked putting a hand on my arm. This responsibility is a heavy burden, but I would respect her like she wanted</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s nothing either of us can do about it, but hiding this will only make trouble and break my promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m alright. Just thinking.&#34; I said truthfully. &#34;Eternya&#39;s task may be my own one day. It won&#39;t be here, but it will be on some other world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was quiet a while Willow was raised mortal Her heart hurt for the countless untold number of them that will die by my hands</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It won&#39;t be today.&#34; She said firmly. She made her peace with this information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope not.&#34; I smiled. &#34;I intend on taking you on a small date.&#34; She got the pups, and I got Flora to agree to babysit. I should trust her more Just because she is inexperienced with this kind of thing, doesn&#39;t mean that she&#39;ll break down into a ball of tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That sounds fun.&#34; She smiled. Willow wanted to take the boys with us, but they can&#39;t keep up yet Plus I had plans. &#34;Do we need anything?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I said texting Flora. She was already here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re going to have so much fun!&#34; Flora beamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow hesitated to hand them over, but we needed the break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll be back by 7.&#34; I said happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ll be asleep by then. I know their schedule.&#34; Flora beamed, burying her face in their fluff. &#34;They smell like coconuts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s their shampoo.&#34; Said my mate with a little pride. I kidnapped her before she could stay with Flora instead. &#34;No car?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No car. No distractions.&#34; I grinned holding my bride. I teleported when I got her hand. She screamed, but once she saw where I took her, she clapped excitedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lapping waves of the tropical beach wetted my shoes. We were in the middle of nowhere, about 50 miles from the South African mainland. I still don&#39;t believe I got the favor I asked, but there was a beach house here maintained by mermaids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a house!&#34; Willow shouted, excitedly running up the slight hill, stopping short of the grass once I let her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This island was only about a mile in circumference, but what it lacked in size, it made up for in all the fruit trees here, and the tiny fence that separated the private beach from the 20 room estate. The environment was artificially maintained to be 75, sunny, and have mild tides</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That place is a private getaway for the elite. To be honest, I didn&#39;t think I had enough pull to have access to this place, but here we are.&#34; I chuckled. &#34;What&#39;s better is that we&#39;re the only ones here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen your family is-&#34; I cut her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I know.&#34; I complained. &#34;I want to take these off.&#34; I pulled off my clothes and let them hang on one of the thin fence poles. She looked at me pretty intensely. I guess she wasn&#39;t used to the nudity still, but I wouldn&#39;t tease her about it... Gods she smelled as sweet as a bouquet of flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That and the fact this place is named Paradice Island.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted, and chased her. She was *so* slow, but it was fun to see her squeal and giggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not being fair!&#34; She laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Then shift!] I said shaking my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stripped and excitedly ran as her fox form Now catching her had become a little difficult. She could zip ahead as red lightning, but she had little control over it. That was the part that made it hard, since she was unpredictable. Her stamina was the issue now. She evaded me a good 20 minutes, but she panted heavily. I let her have her fun, thinking she could escape me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We did this until she got tired. She shifted and I teleported, picking her up when I got to her. She smelled aroused I ignored it. It could be that she was just having a good time. Her light hum as she caressed my shoulder made me a little excited</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still won.&#34; She said nipping my mark spot She had to lean up to do it, but I was no longer confused by her actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I wasn&#39;t hard before, I was now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow.&#34; I warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your growl is hot.&#34; She snickered. She did it again, but this time she pulled herself up to lick it as well. She took her time while I made it back to our clothes I used my shirt as a towel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We aren&#39;t&#39; even going to make it to the house.&#34; I said kissing her on the forehead, then the lips when she looked up at me Her doe eyes were so innocent, yet wicked. She Knew she was turning me on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care.&#34; She said reaching down and stroking me. Gods it felt good Her hand couldn&#39;t wrap all the way around it, but the smooth, steady sensation made me want to take her right now</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit.&#34; I hissed in pleasure She roused instincts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t had you since the pups were born.&#34; She said rubbing my cock &#34;I thought you noticed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you were just happy to be out.&#34; I admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am&#34; She sighed happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we can stay out here as long as we want. Time here works differently.&#34; I smiled. It was why I rented it. &#34;The magic of this place works so that a day here was an hour back home. I rented this place 5 days. So we&#39;ll be home by 6 since it was 1pm when we left .If we buy an additional day, it&#39;ll be 7pm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked beyond surprised. She jumped on me, and I purposefully fell into the sandy grass. I held her by the waist, and I let her be on top of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you.&#34; She smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you too.&#34; I said kissing her tenderly. Above all I must be gentle with my wife All this is going to be at her pace. &#34;You work so hard, and stress so much. You deserve this break.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to accept my statement, but she didn&#39;t say anything. We just cuddled a minute and listened to the waves She&#39;d had pups at fucking *27* because of me Most wait between 100 to 500 She had to learn how to be a Luna, and accept all the cultural bullshit that does Not happen with humans</p>
