                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vacation lasted the entire week, and honestly it was nice. I felt weird leaving the pups so long, but it wasn&#39;t that long. They&#39;ll be in bed by the time by now anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look sour.&#34; Chuckled Kaizen. &#34;We can rent this place again in four months&#39; time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to play with the boys some more. It feels like we&#39;ve been gone forever.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I know. I want to see how they&#39;re progressing. It seems like the moment we turn around, they figure out so much. Let&#39;s go.&#34; Kaizen said this taking my arm, and teleporting us in our room. It was 7pm here, but I was nowhere near ready to go to bed or anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated to leave the room, but I wanted my babies. &#34;Let&#39;s go to Flora&#39;s.&#34; I said as he stretched. We left at sunrise; it was weird that it was sundown here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. But be warned, there was a bit of drama while you were gone.&#34; He said putting the bags in the closet. They&#39;ll get washed later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; I asked honestly curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eternya torched all the higher ups of Elinore&#39;s coven. Those burns on her body were for a magic ring.&#34; He scoffed. &#34;I still can&#39;t believe it myself. Had that been you, I&#39;m sure not a soul would have been left to bitch about a little fire.&#34; He growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It concerned me a little, because I knew he wasn&#39;t joking. &#34;I hope he at least only got the people responsible.&#34; I said as we went down the stairs. There were Warriors up and about, but not many. Those who were on the clock were mostly outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got out there, I saw many more in uniform or shifted. Kaizen told me at one point about that. He told me this was normal, and how a pack should run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; He said a little sheepishly, opening the door for me. &#34;As a fellow demigod, I know he went overboard, and knew he was while he was doing it but I understand. I can&#39;t live without you now that I have you. Anything that impedes your happiness is a greater priority than anyone realizes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We knocked as lightly as we could on the door and Ellio answered. He put a finger to his lips, wearing a scorched white t shirt. They snored in his arms, so fat they looked about ready to pop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The must have been a handful.&#34; I giggled in a whisper. I was handed our boys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They didn&#39;t blow up the kitchen over a toaster.&#34; Ellio joked sheepishly. We all got a little laugh out of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hopefully they won&#39;t, but I know this is going to get destructive and expensive.&#34; I sang while they wagged their tails sleepily. They had no intention of waking yet. I knew about the petty-cash fund though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s Eternya?&#34; Asked Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He had to be stopped from returning to finish off her parents. He didn&#39;t take kindly to them dismissing her so rudely.&#34; Ellio snorted. It seemed they pissed him off too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it wasn&#39;t for her already being completely distraught, I&#39;d have let him too.&#34; Said Flora. &#34;They blamed her like she sicked father on them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother You and grandfather fly above them. They can&#39;t blame or question someone like him, so they targeted the next best thing.&#34; Ellio said surprisingly perceptive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Why am I not surprised?&#34; I said petting Vex. I think he didn&#39;t snore quite as loud as Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you realize how fucked up everything is all the time.&#34; Said Flora. &#34;But thankfully Misfit is literally about as good as it can get for most of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but it still sucks.&#34; I said holding the boys close to me. &#34;Is she still around?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s at her house with father, but I think it&#39;s best to leave her be for now.&#34; Said Flora. She was right. For me, I&#39;d been gone a week, for them, it&#39;d only been several hours. It was still fresh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then in the meantime, if they need anything from us, we&#39;re back.&#34; I said giving Flora a hug as best as I could. &#34;Thanks for watching the pups.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They were a breeze.&#34; She giggled. &#34;I even found some sticks they can try burning next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, we went next door, and Eternya was in the living room with another General of Xaxas. I believe he was the Beast Prince, a mythological man who was always depicted at Xaxas&#39;s left, with the Reaper at his right. To be fair though, the Horned One was usually the centerpiece in any painting or warning of hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, there you are.&#34; He smiled. &#34;Me and my subordinate here are discussing the fines of his unauthorized coven burning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I would have left a few to lead, I wouldn&#39;t have such a hefty fine, but I hold no remorse.&#34; Eternya said firmly. &#34;She&#39;s resting now; she didn&#39;t even look at me when I left&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;ll come around.&#34; I said as he nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know Lady Willow. It&#39;s just something I&#39;m not quite used to. Those fuckers were lucky anything at All was left.&#34; He snorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s the human section?&#34; Asked Kaizen. He sat in a chair, and I sat next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fully warded.&#34; Said the Beast Prince. His eyes reminded me of the look cats give before they pounce. Yet I could tell by the way he spoke that he&#39;d probably employ someone else to do that for him. &#34;I&#39;ve also made it so that if any have ill intention, or have unauthorized materials like magical storage bags, that they&#39;re teleported out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good.&#34;  I got the pups.&#34; Said Kaizen. He gently scooped them up, and they still slept soundly. They had a big day while we were out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess in the meantime, I can go upstairs and get a gander at the MoonPack Sy-&#34; I was cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got that. *You* go enjoy yourself.&#34; He encouraged. He gently nudged, and walked me to the door. &#34;It&#39;ll be the last free night we get until next vacation.&#34; He teleported to the top of the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I essentially got put out my own home to go relax. I didn&#39;t wait for anyone to change their mind either. I&#39;ll cuddle the boys when they get up They had So much milk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to use my pump in the next hour and a half, so I figured I&#39;d walk around town for a moment. Just because they have extra, doesn&#39;t mean I can stop. If I did, production would as well. But I didn&#39;t let any of that stay on my mind The night was young.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air was clean and crisp I think I got really lucky on living somewhere safe enough to do this. I lived in a tiny town, and after that, I worked for an upscale private school. I never got to live or see the dirtiest parts of this world when I was human</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kind of just had a generic life. I didn&#39;t know vampires ran most major cities through bribed human politicians. I didn&#39;t know that there was a whole other world, an ugly underbelly where the strong eat the weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the park, I ran into wolves doing mixed gender exercise. They did pushups, while a drill sergeant yelled at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember when you&#39;re alone, a Rogue won&#39;t hesitate, even if you do!&#34; Shouted the male Warrior. He had only one green eye, and was covered in thick scars, but he may have been the stockiest wolf besides Kaizen yet. His gold hair was in a tight, short ponytail, and his growl was mean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know why, but I joined them. Nobody stopped me, and nobody stopped what they were doing either. I&#39;d done about 8 before I saw another drill sergeant point to me. The original one smiled when he saw me in the back, but he hadn&#39;t ordered them to stop doing pushups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just because you are my Alpha&#39;s mate, does not mean Basic Training Will Be Easy. Do You Understand That Luna?!&#34; He shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Sir!&#34; I shouted back. To be fair this was easy. I knew a little self-defense, but a little more wouldn&#39;t hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What combat experience do you have pup?!&#34; He barked. &#34;Speak up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About 3 years of Karate.&#34; I admitted. &#34;Sir!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kneeled next to me while I still joined in the fun This didn&#39;t hurt, nor was it tiring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ready to be broken down and built up into a First Class Luna the likes have which this pack has never seen?&#34; He grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve seen you escorted around like a pup.&#34; Said the other Drill Sergeant. He looked Asian with a deep tan, and his accent reminded me of someone from Bostyn. &#34;I bet you want to be able to protect yourself and your babies yourself, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do. This is easy.&#34; I growled. I admit when they do it it&#39;s cooler</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled.</p>
