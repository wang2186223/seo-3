                <p>chapter!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was my first pup. And they killed it. *THAT&#39;S* Why father warned me not to buy an expensive one one I&#39;d baby. I am the wolf. We do not value things the normal way. The human way</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been outright mad enough to really Really *want* to be a monster but one looked about 9, and the older brother was probably 16. I will not harm children for a metal box a hundred grand metal box. But it&#39;s still a box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need to get it together. It&#39;s a box with rubber wheels. I can buy another one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;..sir.&#34; said the elder boy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could shake the hide right off you. Where&#39;s your mother?!&#34; I demanded. My eyes cast red light on them, and it was a New Moon tonight, so the only light out here was *me*. My Jentucky accent came out. &#34;You know how dangerous that was?! You earned a Time Out ! Shit that was reflexdad was right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s hurt!&#34; Said the littlest boy. He hugged my legs. &#34;Please save mama!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take me to her.&#34; I picked up the kid. He&#39;s too young to shift yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The teenager shifted, and I held his little brother. It amazed him that I didn&#39;t have to shift to keep up. That was as fast as he could go, while I stomped through the stupid forest, but my anger subsided seeing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I do admit, I have a soft spot for Omegas. They stand no chance against a Rogue I see mistreatment of them as bullying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their father&#39;s corpse lay twitching as he convulsed, losing his form. That&#39;s common when we die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help my mate.&#34; He rasped. &#34;She&#39;s over there.&#34; He weakly pointed to a heavily clawed Omega but it was just her arm. She&#39;ll hurt but it wasn&#39;t enough to kill her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that he was *alive* is almost cruel</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. Please help Willie.&#34; She said looking down, holding her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do what I can, but he needs to get to the infirmary once I stabilize him.&#34; He won&#39;t make it without some intervention first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. My Healing magic may as well be null, but good old fashioned pressure to the wound does wonders. It also helps that my grip can cauterize wounds. Not ideal but better than bleeding out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those cuts they were Clean. Precise</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who attacked you?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. It was so fast, and it&#39;s so dark. One was a wolf, and the other could fly, but that was all I could make out sir.&#34; She looked down. Her sons comforted her as best as they could</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jack.&#34; I sighed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Master.&#34;  He beamed, covered in blood materializing behind the mother without sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AH!&#34; they all screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry Nothing personal.&#34;  He bowed. &#34;Jack the Slasher, at your service.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had the body of a bird person in his hand? It was sliced up worse than the male.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that a harpy?&#34; I asked. Half beasts like Jerold. Some are mindless, but I thought since they were born with human heads, that harpies at least knew what they were doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever it was counted for his &#39;one a day&#39; bullshit, but I know him as much as I can hear him. He&#39;s not stable enough to be on Urth right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It *was* your highness. Plucked the bitch right out the sky with a well placed rock.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Language.&#34; I said firmly. He bowed his head. Bitch shouldn&#39;t be said around small children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I read his memories. He was the one to slice up the husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Harpy smelled the blood. But he thought it best to spare the Omega since he is permitted to slay one a day, so he saved her from the attack at the last second. A hair longer and she&#39;d be dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jack.&#34; I said as he materialized behind the female. He can&#39;t outright teleport long distances *yet*, but he can phase. So long as there&#39;s another shadow to jump to, he can leap quite a ways away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I handed him the scroll. &#34;Go have fun.&#34; I let grandfather babysit him while I delt with this. Those slashes looked serious</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\----Jack----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I touched it, I was teleported Below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think my master knew how unstable I was. I still shook that kill was Fresh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it was *taken*. And past midnight I get *two* today</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted more I was not satisfied that my master spared my prey. But I cannot question his reasons. Maybe they may prove useful. Such soft flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here Jack?&#34; Asked the Horned One</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed I ended up in his throne room. The most beautiful goddess of them all had at least a million red threads in her hands while I could tell the Horned One made souls. I&#39;ve seen it before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw what Eskaal can do I I almost remembered something but it faded away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How flattering.&#34; She said with a shy smile, and I bowed lower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That is the *only* expression my Pale Lady should have. She gave me this gift I don&#39;t have the ability to thank her enough. There is no hunt great enough, no death spectacular enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did not know you loved my wife so fervently.&#34; Said the Horned One. He sounded pleased. He should not be I do not kneel low enough and my hands were too clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Through her grace I have my mate master.&#34; I bowed, but she looked confused. &#34;The lives I take in her name were spared. but I will try again tomorrow I must give my offering I Must be useful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must. If I don&#39;t I *will*. If I do not kill on purpose, I will on accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Kaizen sent you.&#34; Said the Horned One with a soft smile. &#34;But now you belong to me little one. I am pleased with your offerings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One a day, forever more master.&#34; I said firmly. &#34;More if I find black X&#39;s.&#34; Fellow pit candidates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me for giving you to my grandson Jack.&#34; Said the Moon goddess, coming and petting my head as it was bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not lament me mistress. Your grandson takes care of me well.&#34; I said honestly. He does I want not for meat nor prey. &#34;I was instructed to have fun mistress.andI can&#39;t think of a greater joy than aiding the masters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t been killing more than one person a day, have you?&#34; Asked my most precious goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No my lady the master keeps a tight leash.&#34; I chuckled. He does. I have very *little* fun these days. What an honor that she looks my direction, a dog who belongs in the Pit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I actually need a new dog.Want to come with me?&#34; Asked the Horned One. &#34;My son has commandeered my wife for tonight. She makes bonds. I&#39;ve made all the souls I wanted to make. If he&#39;s doubling all hell, he can double it his-fucking-self.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything master.&#34; I said shifting. I wagged my tail. He pet me between the ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh this is going to be Fun.&#34; He said putting a collar on my neck it fit like a necklace until he increased my size II had to be 800 pounds On my back legs, I might be taller than a grizzly Sweet! &#34;Let&#39;s go for a walk.&#34;</p>
