                <p>chapters!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re gone.&#34; Sighed Queen Samira sadly. She clutched her hands to her chest, and looked at the road. I felt bad too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could almost feel the distance between us, and they&#39;d only left an hour ago. We sat outside originally because the weather was nice also wolves were finishing up fixing the entrance of the house, and asked politely to wait a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s do something productive.&#34; I said slapping my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would not cry I had to be strong. All the supernatural peoples would expect us, those in the Royal House to be someone to look up to. It wasn&#39;t like I wasn&#39;t used to that either, dealing with little children who look to adults.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time to fake it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you have in mind?&#34; Asked Flora. Her hair blazed like fire since it glowed. &#34;All my flowers are wilting but at least my sons are waking up.&#34; As their original caretaker, she loved them equally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?! Did Kaizen press his horns to them?&#34; I asked first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No but at least I know Half Beast.&#34; She smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; I said pulling my hair a bit, then pinning it into a messy bun as if that was my plan all along &#34;Alavastros can fill them in with you. Jack, I want you to patrol, but at the same time I know you&#39;d do better In town since you&#39;re so strong Ace do you think you can do patrol?&#34; I asked, he bowed. Jack vanished without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away.&#34; Ace said shifting and leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can send the royal guard.&#34; Said Samira. She motioned the Guard Captain Shakira, the hyena shifter. She stood a head and shoulders taller than the wolves at her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My lady, you&#39;re our priority.&#34; Said Shakira.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. I want the wolves to leave. Honestly, with you and Jack here, anyone else is overkill.&#34; She said glancing at King Jerold&#39;s half beasts. The centaur was shifted, alert with aviator shades on. He wore leather armor on his torso, while his back had a satchel that held a bow and arrow..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Captain Bane Bloodhoof, leader of the Royal Half-beast Guard.&#34; He bowed. &#34;I am here for King Noah, but my eyes can see to the gates of Misfit. I will blow my horn should I sense anything.&#34; He was as large as the centaurs in hell, though his fur wasn&#39;t black like most of them. He was a dappled blue-gray horse with a black mane, hair and spots. His body shape was like a big draft horse, maybe a Clydesdale because of the black fur at his hooves?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect Captain Bloodhoof.&#34; Said Noah stoically, with a cup of coffee. He still looked pretty tired. &#34;I want you on watch, and your son Banth can watch your back... I need a nap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He roared and trotted off casually, while a littler version of him went the opposite direction to watch the back of the neighborhood His son looked kind of like a teenager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright now you two need to relax before I do.&#34; Said Noah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can we?&#34; Said Samira with worry. &#34;How are you so calm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been left behind many times, but honestly after Wednesday, he can leave me every time.&#34; He joked. &#34;Why don&#39;t you two go help Flora? Neither of you speak Half-beast, but they&#39;ll feel more comfortable with you, especially Willow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and we left Noah alone the &#39;nap&#39; he wanted was honestly being passed out for a full 8 hours. Now that his mate wasn&#39;t here, he could stop pretending that he could keep up Last time he slept so hard, Jerald almost took him to the new clinic</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook off a shudder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt so watched, knowing full well that was Jack.  Inside Flora&#39;s house, they smelled like they&#39;d had showers, and they were clothed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flora hugged them all, though it was. really weird to see her kind side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They cannot speak English, but they express their gratitude&#34; She said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish I could help.&#34; I said silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The horn was blown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With it the earth shook as if some massive foe landed in Flora&#39;s yard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Last Yellow Lavender! NO!&#34; She screamed running out while Jack held me firmly. The next thing I knew, me and Samira were in Kaizen&#39;s Hellcat, and Jack cranked the car, but it wouldn&#39;t start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the passenger window I saw why his first choice was to just run. In the flaming circle was an enemy I knew none of the Royal Guards could take, yet those that were close fearfully had their weapons drawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think I would let you get away?&#34; Asked a woman, who stood as tall as Kaizen in his true form. &#34;Forgive my flames; I offer gold as compensation.&#34; She said snapping her fingers, and a small satchel of gold clinked to the ground just out of my view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were naked, but their chest was flat I couldn&#39;t see, nor wanted to really look at what was below Bushes obstructed about half their body from my view. Her voice was offputtingly masculine, but they were so beautiful, I can&#39;t imagine her being a man. Their build was lean with a deep chest, but their form held no flaws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their hair was red as actual fire, and the green eyes they held were full of anger, curiosity, and a sneer that told me we were Dirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just a glance, but it made me too scared to move. What monster was *this*.?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stood in front of Flora, and she kneeled on hands and knees. She shook as she disappeared out of sight, while the beast-woman was silent. They tapped their foot with crossed arms, shaking the earth ever so slightly with the motion. I couldn&#39;t find myself sitting up enough to see the details of that but I could tell by their body movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;King of the Flame, allow my-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His five steps forward showed he was *definitely* a man</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ask for Any beyond yourself to breathe? Have you been given my permission to do such a presumptuous thing?&#34; He boomed. It broke the windows of the car. He sighed. &#34;I should not hold a temper at *you* . The hot tongue lashes of my master have left me a little cross.  and I came making a grand entrance.&#34; He said the last part sheepishly. I think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know what she said, since it was like eagle noises? That language was too far from what I&#39;d heard before to make heads or tails of it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Eternya, the Flaming One, son of the Volcano God Apolis, more importantly, General of his majesty, the Realm King. And I have come myself to see my folly.&#34; He sneered. &#34;Rise. I am not here for violence.&#34; He chuckled. I don&#39;t know what he kneeled down to tell her, since it was so quiet, but he said it with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could literally feel the heat radiating off him from here. I don&#39;t know how I did it, but I got out of the car before Jack could stop me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then if you are here for peace, Stand Down.&#34; I said standing on shaky legs, looking him in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within an instant, he was in front of me. He caught all three arrows meant for his back, shot by the centaurs, and they became ashes in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He told me you were as fiery as your hair little vixen.&#34; He grinned ignoring the growing number of hostel guards. &#34;The Master is unable to be involved you see.&#34; He snapped his fingers about five times. &#34;What is the mortal saying? &#39;Put his foot in his mouth&#39;.?&#34; I nodded. &#34;So I am here, in his stead. And to handle my bloodline.&#34; He bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your bloodline?&#34; Said Samira. &#34;I know him I&#39;ve only met him once, but only as a bird. Eternya can be trusted.&#34; She stood at my side, smelling like a nervous horse, but the backup was nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he Was Flora&#39;s father So many old people were out here having unclaimed kids; they better be glad child support wasn&#39;t a thing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Allow me entrance that I see my other blood.&#34; He said as a king would. There was no option to say anything other than &#39;yes&#39; as he looked at Flora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; She said in English.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Why Not?&#34; He demanded. &#34;Is it my visage? I asked Lord Asanguis did I look approachable, and he said I did.&#34; He grumbled. &#34;Perhaps I look unnaturally so He did say I looked too hot for my own good, but I thought that was just a pun laced joke.&#34; he scratched his chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your *tone* is too hot.&#34; I growled it sounded like a fox but I didn&#39;t mean to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile was genuine, as if he was holding a laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You remind me of the young master&#39;s mate, Isabelle.&#34; He said shaking his head. He bowed to me and Samira.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow&#39;s right.&#34; Said Samira. &#34;I can&#39;t lie; you came so angered I didn&#39;t recognize you at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I suppose.&#34; He said scratching his head. &#34;How have you been since last I aided Lord Tyson?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine without being scared half to death!&#34; She complained. &#34;I vouch for him. He flew around the castle to protect me, and offered his aid to my mate. &#34; She didn&#39;t share details but I would ask later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will not disappoint my lady Now let me see him. I would not harm my own bloodline for no reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.no.&#34; Said Flora quietly. &#34;You&#39;ll see he has no wings and behead him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed. &#34;I knew that before I left. Of Course, as the Fucking Bird King, I&#39;d want my clutch to have flight, but I won&#39;t kill him for it. That isn&#39;t some crime so long as he isn&#39;t a featherless chicken; then he&#39;d be a jay bird.&#34; He joked It did make Flora smile a little. &#34;My last brood were traitors, and this one is unpledged.&#34; He huffed. &#34;I just want to see him, speak with him. So long as you hail to the master, I have no issue with anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t know English yet.&#34; I blurted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know most major languages, albeit older words&#34; He said scratching his chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Swear you won&#39;t harm any of them.&#34; Flora said standing, glaring him in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What of yourself?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one swift motion, he grabbed Jack from thin air, and slammed him to the ground He was unconscious from the impact, but otherwise was unharmed... I don&#39;t know how I knew that, but when I kneeled to check on him, he was alright</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care about myself.&#34; Flora said firmly, looking at Jack so simply defeated Regardless of Samira&#39;s words, Eternya wasn&#39;t trusted</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want no ill of either of you, or any you house, but I won&#39;t allow mortal hostility.&#34; Eternya said becoming duller. The heat that radiated off him was gone, along with the aura. &#34;It has been a long time since I&#39;ve had to restrain myself so tightly.&#34; He sighed. &#34;Also can someone at Least get me some pants?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the house with a nod, and one of my wolves ran to get him something. He shrank in the meantime about 5 inches still having to borrow Kaizen&#39;s clothes because I&#39;m sure nothing else would fit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Old Ones were literal forces of nature. He didn&#39;t Have to ask Anything. He could have just gone inside, but it was appreciated that he waited for the permission. Flora reminded me almost of mama birds, ready to swoop anyone who came near her sons. After all, I didn&#39;t know how long she was their caretaker, but I knew she was really old herself, and dodged a proverbial bullet. I knew by his mannerism he held no attachment to anything other than his master. Had this been during the war, I don&#39;t know if Misfit wouldn&#39;t be on fire right now, instead of a peaceful resolution.</p>
