                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was it the moon would be full tonight, but I was still working. I was still figuring out the MoonPack system, on the phone with Tyson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry to bother you about this.&#34; He said typing on his computer. &#34;If it wasn&#39;t important, I wouldn&#39;t have asked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, the pack&#39;s registration is important.&#34; I mumbled fumbling around in the menu Damn it. Where was it? The pack had everyone labeled as wanted Rogues, meaning that anyone from here who was on vacation could have trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me access to your screen. Click ok.&#34; He said with a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did so, and the cursor zipped across the screen and clicked the Pack File. &#34;Were you putting people in here?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought that&#39;s where they went.&#34; I said sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The &#39;R&#39; stands for Rogue.&#34; He said a little frustrated. &#34;Is Kaizen still out? He should be back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s obsessed with crossing out the last person on his scroll.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit. We were supposed to contain the Ragnorock Cult together.&#34; He complained. &#34;For him to speak so highly of *not* being a king and not *having to do anything*, he sure takes it upon himself to save the world all night.&#34; He said as his chair creaked. &#34;Anyway. I have to get back to Dr. Sampson. He said when he&#39;s done here, he&#39;s headed your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll head out to the hospital after-&#34; I was cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No buts. Rest. You&#39;ll need it.&#34; He warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s your baby?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Asleep with Samira.&#34; He said as if he were smiling. &#34;I won&#39;t spoil it though; you&#39;ll have to see him when you&#39;re able to visit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hung up before I protested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My lady I ask that you retire.&#34; Said Elinore. She happily smiled, but I wanted to help. This was my mistake, and Tyson was taking time away from his wife and child to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever had so much energy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be fine. Valery said that births don&#39;t usually start until sundown.&#34; I smiled. &#34;Plus, the Least I can do is fix this so no one&#39;s out there, registered as a rogue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elinore was pretty much married to Eternya on the spot It doesn&#39;t get anymore paired than the Realm King&#39;s decree. To be fair, I still felt a need to apologize for being a little rude to him on Eternya&#39;s behalf. I just didn&#39;t like the idea that he was blocked from having a family because of his past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it was his doing, if he was the traitor, I wouldn&#39;t have batted an eyelash, but no one should be punished for what their children choose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The border is secure mistress.&#34; Said Eternya, looking steeled He wasn&#39;t his flamboyant self today. Today was business, as his job is to protect me even if Elinore were to be in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated that too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your protection is, and always will be priority over anyone else&#39;s needs.&#34; Eternya said, hearing me. &#34;With the Master&#39;s blood out, until he returns, I am bound to behave as if I were your last defense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, I guess we should-&#34; before I could finish, my legs felt wet. Damn. I didn&#39;t even have a contraction or anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is all that?! Shouted Eternya. &#34;Is it going to pop out of you?! I&#39;m not ready for that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No my water broke. It means the babies are ready.&#34; I said shaking my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not ready for that either! Can you hold them in until we get to the hospital?!&#34; He screamed, pulling his hair He was a warrior. Not a doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got her care bag.&#34; Said Valery. I didn&#39;t know she was even downstairs, but it seemed everyone prepped for when I would have them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I changed into a purple maternity dress, but it was then that I actually felt the pain of this. I was stopped in my tracks. Each one was like I was being hit by a truck. They were close too, way too close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my hand against the wall... it felt like I was being clawed open from the inside Holy shit. There was a pulse to it, as if they were trying to escape. If they were, I wished they&#39;d be a little patient I felt a little dizzy. I swayed a little, but the Bird King was close, keeping me from actually falling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I smell blood.&#34; Said Eternya. He picked me up and carried me to Flora&#39;s Nissan. &#34;You&#39;re bleeding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s natural.&#34; I said with a wince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not that much.&#34; He pointed I felt my seat was wet That was too much blood</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pack patrol escorted us to the small clinic, and inside, the Horned One was already there, in his doctor&#39;s office. I bled so much that it pooled on Eternya&#39;s arms before it dripped down the hall when he carried me again  It hurt. I began to feel drowsy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Horned One&#39;s glare told me that he didn&#39;t do this to me . &#34;Place her in Room 4, good thing I thought to bring kitsune blood with me.&#34; He said matter of fact. &#34;Leave the room so I can speak with my patient.&#34; He said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He summoned a syringe. &#34;This is for pain. I don&#39;t want to use magic on you at the moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course sir.&#34; I said a little bit worried</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t do that Dr. Sampson.&#34; Said Eternya. &#34;I am bound by the word of my master, that I keep watch over her.&#34; He said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Horned One looked Beyond pissed, likely debating on breaking character. &#34;Then Child of Apolis, you shall help.&#34; He decreed. &#34;I think I should give her a cesarean; the left baby is turned &#39;round the wrong way, and his claws gutted her pretty good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kind of broke character by just knowing that, not doing an X-ray, ultrasound, or anything, but I was grateful. If he knew what was wrong, he likely knew how to fix this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are they going to be ok?&#34; I still asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. I&#39;m the best there is.&#34; He smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He washed his hands, and I was put on a surgical table. Nurses prepped my body to be cut. Now I was scared I would be awake during this Eternya looked a little pale, and none of the women were allowed in the room. It was already full of assistants and nurses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Kaizen?&#34; He asked suddenly. The Horned One&#39;s eyes for a moment were completely void black, and he growled. &#34;Where&#39;s the father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s out on a mission.&#34; Said Eternya. He looked suspicious, but with all the chaos of this I doubt he&#39;d realize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll skin him alive if he misses this. Get her IV started.&#34; He barked at no one in particular, and he left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that about?&#34; Asked Valery from the other side of the door. She still wasn&#39;t permitted in, but to be fair I really did just want my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could say anything, he came back in full scrubs, fresh for the procedure. &#34;I think it best you engage Herculian, Eternya. I&#39;m not in the mood to fucking play with Arviel&#39;s people.&#34; He hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>----Kaizen----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fucked up coming alone, but now that I was here, I had no choice but to finish this. 300 were already slain, but their leader dodged me. They attempted to summon a portal that would bring the raw energy of the sun right down on the planet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would vaporize everything if they succeeded. The power of the sun is shielded by the void. It forces that kind of energy to lose its potency before it touches the ground The Goddess of Air makes the atmosphere. They figured out how to bypass her magic, making one portal to gather unfiltered solar power, and the other to beam it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I&#39;d waited, they would have succeeded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were warned Rodney.&#34; I snarled. I&#39;d lit fires throughout the mansion, but now he&#39;d fled into a cellar. The tunnel that led below the ground was open. A bookshelf was its door, but I didn&#39;t hesitate. I couldn&#39;t really take in what I was looking at. I just bolted through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How the Fuck they learned magic like that didn&#39;t matter. What mattered was that I left none of them alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their slippery leader was escaping by using tunnels and portals that eventually led to a room underground. I think we were in Los Vegos. I managed to barely jump through the red portals</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay back!&#34; he yelled. He wore red robes with the on scalesThose scales were Xaxas&#39;s symbol. They thought balance for this world was best if everything and everyone were dead. I could not allow that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just Die Already!&#34; I yelled. I missed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fucking missed with my lightning, when he was right in front of me. Frustration made me miss again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I roared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crashed into the wall in front of him with my abilities, and I finally caught him. I pulled him apart by tearing him in half, but I could not savor this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the snap of my fingers, I couldn&#39;t believe I&#39;d crossed out the last 3 star threat on my list. The rest were small fry. They could wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt like an idiot The living room was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I linked Jack. /Where is everyone?/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Hiding. I&#39;m on the roof of the hospital. Luna&#39;s having birthing troubles, but Dr. Sampson is here. / he said this casually, as if he were confident in the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the door to see Eternya shifted in the air. I didn&#39;t understand eagle. It didn&#39;t matter what he said. He was doing his job but the town was being destroyed by whomever he was fighting Half the town was on fire from a single one of his attacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Evacuate the town./ I linked every wolf here. I know that likely gave them a headache, but better they be woken up if they were asleep, than to die in it.</p>
