                <p>A/N:  Hi! I have a happy surprise! The Yellow Diamond is OUT, and attached to The Wolf Prince: His Terrified Mate (Kaiden&#39;s Book) Heidie&#39;s daughter gets to put her feet in the water, and make her own coven. It won&#39;t be easy, even with all the knowledge she already holds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left the girls to be babysat with my magic while I chastised Eternya one last time. To be fair, even my little brothers and their mates were entertained. Why not? The girls would never see battle as far as any of us were concerned, nor could they ever really be of real use being so green. Uriel made them silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was nothing. He could go toe to toe with my Third, Kusare, The Rotted One, even though he had 8 arms, being a centipede-wasp-spider creation of mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bird King kneeled at my feet in Kaizen&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t sense anymore of your bloodline To be honest I didn&#39;t check last time because it never occurred to me how horny you were.&#34; I said glaring at him and the bull Ellio. Gods he was about as innocent as a child, being mindless until a few days ago by my general&#39;s report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me wonder were there any more children.  I closed my eyes and checked this living world. 458 of Arviel&#39;s sons still lived, and 1 undocumented, unaccounted for</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One downstairs. A new soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I checked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Souls? They were too fresh, not even the flesh was made yet. This was done Today</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zytherian was my Herald. I cannot deploy him for Kaizen&#39;s protection nor war  They are meant to observe and send messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eskaal is my second, though I use him for his mind; his strength as an elf is lacking</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kusare the Rotted One, my favorite Abomination, would kill this entire state by accident as my third in command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kenriel, the Sainted, my Fifth General would be a better long term match for Tyson, since he is my only yellow souled, high ranked servant</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted Eternya, my Seventh to stay with Tyson but I would keep him here</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How many were pregnant? I checked this world again. I cannot be mistaken I Must be sure</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.Diana. Grace? Those two were a surprise indeed. Samira.. Willow. Those two were not. They were mated to the main attention holdersbut they were both so young, not even a thousand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did something I should not have done, but I would tell them about it I sighed. Arviel wanted Tyson so bad, that he&#39;d probably curse him if not for the war it would bring He is blessed his father is my father&#39;s son anyone lower would be some writhing lump of contradicting flesh, begging to be dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am the Judge. I deemed mercy on this world. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no problem with the births that may happen I just didn&#39;t want anymore bastards like Confusion or whatever his name was running around messing with the order I maintained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That little shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Master, I ask for mercy.&#34; Eternya bowed. My stern face seemed to bring fear to his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? The boy is a fearful mess,&#34; I motioned him. He had a turkey sandwich for the first time, and his clueless look made me want to crack a grin. I wouldn&#39;t though it would ruin my monologue. &#34;And the woman is useless so attached to her charges.&#34; I said sternly, motioning her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Master for my sons, I would do anything.&#34; She shook for Ellio. She kneeled for his sake, and for the mark on her back shoulder. I would let them breathe, but I wouldn&#39;t give Eternya an easy time with this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His last child nearly brought war to the pantheon. But this one&#39;s loyalty was to whoever it needed to be so her son could live. I could work with that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They hold a master&#39;s mark come war-&#34; I cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think someone would Fucking Try Me?&#34; I snarled. &#34;There Will Be No More War.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kneeled lower. His daughter too She took after him so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Master I-&#34; I cut him off again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be Silent. I will consider them gifts for my nephew.&#34; I left out the harsh words, that as a gift, she&#39;d likely have been a concubine in the old times. His grandson would be a slave at best, at worst maybe a gladiator meant to die while he watched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eternya was not an idiot. It&#39;s why he remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My nephew keeps turning more powerful, hidden beings</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He attracts the attention of those above him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then there&#39;s Tyson a Child of Hell So Pure he did not turn a unicorn into a bicorn with his mark. His own powers burn him His own blood demands he be the General of Hell he needs to be Yet he cannot pull himself out of his personality. That is just who he IS. A good pure being</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arviel&#39;s eyes are on these little ones now, but I would be a good uncle. I may not share Number One with him and father, but as Three, that had to count for something. All those of divine blood are protected by my law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he wishes to steal Tyson and kill Kaizen, he must first go through Me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>----Willow-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the Realm King&#39;s portal magic that showed the fight Kaizen was amazing The Unicorn King made us silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then Kaizen&#39;s arrow blacked out the sky. I actually saw that from here We thought it was a solar eclipse or something well I did I&#39;m sure Harmony, Isabelle, and Nxxia knew</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, Uriel summoned that sword from the Royal Wolf Palace. The original Wolf King took possession of it after Uriel died but now someone like that was on their way here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me worry for Kaizen. And his siblings And War.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all the older supernatural creatures talked about. The ones who lived either during or directly after that time. They spoke of how Xaxas destroyed continents. That national parks we know and love today were not carved by geology in some cases. In some here they were made by battles that killed millions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would like to speak with you.&#34; Said the Realm King at the top of the stairs</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was an extra floor and 7 rooms added for the Officers of the pack, yet, him looking down at me the way he did, I couldn&#39;t read his emotions. His face was stern, yet neutral. I still don&#39;t know how I felt about Kaizen&#39;s uncles. His dad was pretty neutral, but those two seemed to be itching for carnage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright your highness&#34; I said going up, and Isabelle was right behind me. Harmony and Nixxia too. I believe those three were coming to support me, and I honestly appreciated it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat in the guest chair, and oddly enough I sat in the Luna&#39;s spot. Kaizen&#39;s lingering scent made me feel a little comforted. The office was no longer a make shift one, looking proper, while all the extra stuff was moved out the way and put in another new room he made appear from nowhere</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas said making a proper packhouse was his gift for a job well done, along with the seeds of black lavender, the similar to yellow lavender, in our yard. He couldn&#39;t bless the garden with holy magic, but he said that Flora could use double the amount of them to replace the yellow in recipes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Asanguis, fetch me the little unicorn too.&#34; He said leaning back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright brother.&#34; He said doing as he was told.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Bryson!&#34; Xaxas shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine!&#34; Asanguis yelled a little annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t have any siblings, but King Xaxas held the air of someone born a king To be fair with his size and presence, I should be in my own guest chair I was told he was playful and silly even by Harmony, but I had as of yet to see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desk chairs were gathered, and we all were silent until everyone was seated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There.&#34; Said Xaxas. &#34;Did you all see the spit-spat about Tyson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all did, so most of us nodded or mumbled a &#39;yeah&#39;. Lord Bryson and Asanguis sat here next to him but as the oldest, he continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In father&#39;s stead, I am the patriarch of his house, and as the eldest son, it is also my job to make sure all of you are unbothered by Arviel. He is above even me, thus, he should not have major involvement yet he did today. He means to claim Tyson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still don&#39;t get it.&#34; Said Bryson. &#34;Why is he obsessed with My son?&#34; He growled. &#34;He has at least 700 in Wonkipedia&#39;s mythology section.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because King of the Forest, that son&#39;s soul is not Red or Black like ours, it is Gold.&#34; He said interlacing his fingers. The chair turned into a comfy recliner. &#34;You forget mother was made From Arviel She is the moon. After all, her job is merely to reflect his power on the world below.&#34; He growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It echoed in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But that means nothing.&#34; Said Bryson. &#34;He renounced her as his child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But that does not change her bloodline.&#34; Xaxas said impatiently. &#34;Tyson is a Pure souled general  Technically, he does not belong with us Had Arviel been a better man, no one would have issue with this. I&#39;d have removed father&#39;s claim on him myself and let him go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still didn&#39;t get why he asked me to come up here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked you, because they play games.&#34; Said Xaxas, leaning forward. &#34;And now, You and Samira are with child, and I am the one to give them titles, seeing as how I hold so many... Having killed so many. Diana and Grace too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I asked. Samira looked dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Xaxas said a little pissed off. &#34;You sound like you&#39;re not ready, but they&#39;re up there fucking with nature.&#34; he said cryptically.</p>
