                <p>A/N: The rest of this will be posted THIS afternoon, like midnight! it&#39;s already written and edited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of them are lucky. So lucky. If not for me sending off Jack, he&#39;d have seen this as a reset of his one a day rule, and eviscerated some poor fool in anger tonight. He loves his work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for my powers of teleportation, I&#39;d have had turn Mr. Willard Harrison, the former owner of GreenMart. He wasn&#39;t strong or fast. It surprised me that he was able to be a Rogue without incident for so long</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be fair, they might still be in a hotel somewhere if their car didn&#39;t get stolen, along with their valuables. They&#39;d been like this for months, running from GreenMoon but until last week, they at least had supplies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;re clean. No priors, only cleared incident reports that have been .deleted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That pack It seems I&#39;m starting to get more of his people This is the second family, no third after Gloria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gloria is from GreenMoon. She does well now, staying out of trouble. She works with Cecil, the magenta half dragon who runs the daycare. It&#39;s nice to think of all the progress everyone&#39;s making, despite how fucked up tonight has been</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched my custom hellcat be put out by the Misfit Fire Department insurance is dicking me around too, saying that I could have *also* saved my tin can, AND children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck Wax&#39;wakka, Wix&#39;s half-sister. How the Fuck was I supposed to know &#39;wakka&#39; is a goblin insult, and that I *wasn&#39;t* supposed to say it?! Why&#39;d you Keep your original name if it means Wax, Bastard of Hadeon?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please sir forgive my son.&#34; She begged, still being stitched up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If not for Lord Kaizen, I can rightly say your family would be the newest victims of Jack the Slasher.&#34; Said grandfather, posing as a doctor. He babysat Jack And me it seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop begging for their lives. I may be an asshole, but I don&#39;t kill kids.&#34; Not for a car. That&#39;s fucking stupid. &#34;I&#39;m just pissed. That car was a hundred grand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; Said Phillis, the teenager. I&#39;d ad him to the pack no problem, but fuck if I still wasn&#39;t pissed. That was my first big purchase my fastest car even the engine was upgraded. But I did gain a kid with potential. His father may be weak, but I could scent all he needs is a little time and some training.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though I&#39;ve also noticed that since I&#39;ve lived here, all the supernaturals have become stronger, not just those claimed by the Night Court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop Apologizing.&#34; I hissed. &#34;It was an emergency, and *I* left my keys in the car.&#34; I snarled, but then I facepalmed. &#34;It&#39;s My fault but also it&#39;s not all bad.&#34; I sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why&#39;s that sir?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get 5 new pack members if you&#39;re willing to stay.&#34; I said sitting down. &#34;Tell me how you got here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They may have skills, however, they are Weak wolves. No one will take them in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But there&#39;s 4 of us.&#34; Said her youngest, Morgen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but you&#39;re getting a little brother or sister soon too.&#34; I mention casually. The scent of citrus was uncanny. She&#39;s probably 3 months along. Good on her for somehow keeping her family comforted during such a turbulent time. &#34;So tell me why you&#39;re running. I&#39;ll add you with my phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That bitch Gloria. It&#39;s all her fault.&#34; She hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How so?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Green&#39;s a *dog* but he&#39;s a *good* Alpha. Gloria just couldn&#39;t be satisfied She KNEW he was taken, and waved her tail in his face, knowing he&#39;d chase it!&#34; I take it she saw all the flirting. &#34;I I&#39;m only an Omega, so I could only watch I wouldn&#39;t dare say anything to the upper ranks&#34; she hesitated. There it is. I won&#39;t pry, it&#39;ll likely hurt her but grandfather stuck around to see this play out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I take it your Luna thought that since you knew, you either had something to do with it too, or you sided with Gloria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.She didn&#39;t even give me a chance to talk to her Then I started getting write ups.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luna Tyna took her shit out on this Omega. And so did Green.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Omega mistreatment like this is common. There are many who think might is the only thing an Alpha should have In packs like those the weak suffer, but are too afraid to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or unable to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one wants Omegas They&#39;re seen almost as a burden, yet, they are the most useful, since they can travel freely in human towns. People don&#39;t ever think of that trade off</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody sees them as the backbone of a pack. Well, royals do because normal wolves can&#39;t tolerate the castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You can be as strong as you fucking want to be. Don&#39;t get pack deliveries on time and see the chaos of every shop owner and Arrowzon user in your office. Without Omegas, life would be So much riskier, Sanctuary or Not. Shit would be So much more inconvenient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they stay, I really, truly do need more maids and delivery drivers. This town&#39;s saturated with doctors, lawyers, CEO&#39;s and snub nosed high-borns. All commoners are *welcome*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has him frothing at the mouth We shouldn&#39;t have left.&#34; She mumbled, looking at the direction of the operating room Jack put his hands on him. He&#39;ll never walk the same again. Grandfather isn&#39;t the one operating. He&#39;s just here because he wants to be. &#34;The pack makes a lot of money with aviation. But But when his mood&#39;s bad for we Omegas it&#39;s all bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had my attention. If I get up, Green&#39;s going to be delivered to Tyson. Let him deal with him this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After she tricked Alpha, he&#39;s been so bloodthirsty so cruel  His fist is iron His punishments for everything is the maximum sentence..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is Alpha. I believe she&#39;s only in her 50&#39;s or so.&#34; I said it that way to be a little nice about it. &#34;There wasn&#39;t any tricking. He took advantage, then got mad that there were consequences for his doggish decisions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at their files pissed me off. Huh, the Luna&#39;s name is different Oh, she just changed it because she&#39;s registered as mortal relations. Fair enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.Every little thing that goes wrong was her fault. And according to Luna Tyna now everything&#39;s Reeta&#39;s the *real* Luna but&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You disagree, but can&#39;t say anything. Luna Tyna bullies her to no end.&#34; Not illegal but a shit thing to do. She&#39;s trying to make her leave. &#34;Has he purposefully maimed or harmed pack without reason?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No not that I know of.&#34; She lied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked into her memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a maid, and she was accused of stealing. She got lashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both me and grandfather glared at that memory That was a whip meant for ranked Warriors the silver one with nine tails Grandpa Kaiden taught me how to flick that whip good enough to make the silver glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she was innocent there was no investigation her Luna&#39;s words did this to her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what&#39;s worse, was that this was done on purpose. They can&#39;t make it out there Wolves like this really do NEED to be in a pack! That&#39;s what it&#39;s fucking for!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The missing items were found pretty much right after. His mark mate was being absent minded with her jewelry, but that didn&#39;t give him the right to punish so harshly to an Omega no less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that made me feel a little bloodthirsty. It isn&#39;t right. Just because you Can do something, doesn&#39;t mean you Should</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And of course, Willard and Green got into it, but he&#39;s not even Warrior strength. He originally ran their super market, so he will have skills in management, accounting, and dealing with multiple employees as well as customers. It&#39;s hard to find wolves who can do that well, unmonitored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I teleported to GreenMoon after looking up where it was. Fuck it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s getting that personal Visit. He&#39;s earned it now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I landed outside their packhouse and walked in. His Warriors freaked out. Not only did I just appear, but I appeared 7&#39;6, 417 pounds, with a flame between horns that shouldn&#39;t and Don&#39;t exist for not many others. Many bowed or screamed. The usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You don&#39;t get mad at the hands for what the head does.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s your Alpha?&#34; I asked his Beta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Highness!&#34; yelled Beta Oki&#39;ka. I&#39;ve met him before; I think Once at the castle. His Beta&#39;s a stocky white wolf from south Asia. Even when I went to meetings on Tyson&#39;s behalf, this pack was just too far away for us to really be in the same circle. &#34;He&#39;s in his office. He was Just about to do the morning patrol.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; I said going up the stairs. He&#39;ll be at the top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t just about to go on patrol, he was spending time with his mark mate. I could hear him trying to console her, since she thought I&#39;d come to kill him. I had no issue about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I won&#39;t kill him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his face pissed me off</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to ask myself who&#39;ll support his son, the one I&#39;m training myself to come defeat his ass later.? I won&#39;t create any hatred for his father, and I instructed Gloria not to either He&#39;ll do that all on his own, with the way he acts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Green bowed. He held a long braid with shaved sides, a style I thought about, but my horns would make it look weird.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m getting more of your run aways.&#34; I said as we walked to his office. His mark mate followed, though her office wasn&#39;t in his, so she had to sit in a guest chair as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean the Fletcher family?&#34; He said with a sneer. &#34;She stole from us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I actually came on behalf of the Harrison family.&#34; I let my flames flick in my agitation. &#34;You took your frustration out on Omegas and Children. Your Child Support has increased to 7 thousand a month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What! Your Highness-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is compensation.&#34; I said standing as my full height. &#34;It will go to the medical bills created Because of Your Poor Treatment.&#34;</p>
