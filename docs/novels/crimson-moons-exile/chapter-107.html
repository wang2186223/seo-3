                <p>The Horned One</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I *still* tasted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat on my throne now, letting it float in my hand All 3.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pound of dried, pounded hops dust instead of just using floura quarter cup of Suffering, a pinch of Pride, 2 vulture&#39;s eggs, and alligator&#39;s fat for butter And one cup of bile, collected from a fucking behemoth How did she get these things?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All Hell ran as an oiled machine no one bothered me in here. They knew my mind. I enjoy tinkering</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fetch me Hajroomond.&#34; I said casually referring to my show stopping demon. I was so proud of that one when I made him how he crushed buildings underfoot in my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took him only 5 minutes to arrive. He enjoyed the false visage of an elderly man. His white curly hair went to his navel, and his wrinkles were set so deeply, no one would question such a decrepit being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She asked.&#34; It was the first thing he said with a bow. &#34;Master I am unable to deny the request of the Queen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hold no anger at you Hajroomond. I want you to try it.&#34; I said cutting a small slice. &#34;Dear could you come down?&#34; I asked summoning my wife</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How I hoped she would not come The horror of seeing her so happy, no longer tarnished Her silver skin, hair, dress, and shoes shined in her happiness. Her touch gave me peace, and her scent was one of her realm tranquil waters and fresh grass She wore a flower crown made by Lia, so they were getting along well Shit</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I already felt terrible, and I had not admitted anything to her yet. She hugged my neck and sat in my lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You called?&#34; She asked sweetly. &#34;Why do you hold Willow&#39;s gift... and our other children.?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My dear I wish for you to see this&#34; I said unable to look her in the eyes. &#34;Hajroomond take this slice, and be honest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I tried really hard, and you helped me so much.&#34; She beamed. &#34;I almost forgot to thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She jumped out my arms to give my fourth largest demon a fucking rainbow star sticker I was wondering why some of them had little mortal stickers on their uniforms. I don&#39;t deserve this little goddess I really don&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, my master. I will cherish this.&#34; He said honestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put it on his cloak with pale wrinkled hands, though he used magic to preserve it to his tattered black robes. As colorful and &#39;cute&#39; as her sticker set was to be marked by my mate was to receive visual recognition from their Queen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear filled the entire castle, and many servants gossiped if they were next. Many mulled over if they angered me lately, or made a mistake. However, my demon made me somewhat proud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without question or hesitation, he bit into the &#39;cake&#39; made with love</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s disgusting.&#34; He said truthfully. &#34;I can get over the bile, because it&#39;s mine but there&#39;s powdered vinegar in there&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t like it?&#34; She asked quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Master,&#34; He kneeled on hands and knees. &#34;I tried warning you mistress but if you fed this to a mortal, they&#39;re probably dead It tastes of bile, vinegar, suffering, and anguish .&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I *hurt* Willow?! What about Tyson, Samira, Grace, and Aureus. Oh no. I made cakes for all our children!&#34; She hugged my neck. &#34;I was so careless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It will be alright.&#34; I said petting her head. &#34;They all have food poisoning, but they&#39;re alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It looks nice my lady.&#34; He said taking another bite. He finished the slice for her. &#34;I don&#39;t mind finishing it off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*How the fuck did she powder vinegar?* I thought to myself. If I said it out loud, I&#39;d definitely upset her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did she get this from you&#34; I asked, letting him have it He ate them all, disposing of something I would have thrown into the pit while aflame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I shifted, and she went into my maw. She took about 4 cups worth if I remember right my lord.&#34; He bowed. &#34;I will take my leave sire. I must be punished.&#34; He said solemnly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! Don&#39;t be mad at him husband. He only did it because I asked. I wanted to try something new, but I didn&#39;t want to wait for the ingredients. Don&#39;t hurt him.&#34; She hugged my neck, and sat in my lap. I gently held her so she wouldn&#39;t fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will not punish you for obeying your queen.&#34; I said dismissing him. She buried her face in my shoulder a moment. I hated the silence How I knew this would happen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s so bad he thinks he&#39;s going to be *punished*?!&#34; She looked so pitiful It hurt my heart&#34;It isn&#39;t good?&#34; She asked. She sounded broken. She realized all the meals she&#39;d made, and how we all disliked everything. There wasn&#39;t a dish I could stomach without my powers bending reality to *Force* it to taste palatable...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was edible, but this one made them more sick than usual.&#34; I was honest. I needed to &#39;rip off the band aid&#39; as the mortals say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve made at least a hundred meals All of them were like *this*? . Not even food. poisonI made them *sick* and no one wanted to hurt me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. You try.&#34; I said truthfully. I could, or rather would not look down and see her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I teleported to our Zen GardenThey did not need to see their queen so upset. They would not understand this emotion. I made this adjusting every grain of sand..For her. I made this altering my half of all there is waiting for her to be free</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave us.&#34; I commanded no one in particular. Any within earshot scampered off to wherever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time it rained water.  Normal clear water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let her hug my neck in the thunderstorm, and she cried. She balled into my shoulder, hugging my neck. She did try. She only wanted to do a mortal thing for our mortal blood; our sons too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me for not being truthful I did not wish to see your tears my love. The crime is mine. I should have told you sooner, but I  I couldn&#39;t.&#34; I admitted. &#34;Your happiness. It is important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But not to the detriment of our little ones.&#34; She sobbed. I held her and patted her back. It was all I knew to do</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright.&#34; I said soothingly. &#34;They know your heart means well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll never cook a single thing again!&#34; She wailed full of sorrow She&#39;d taken a true liking to this hobby, about as much as I enjoyed stone carving But I had to weigh this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I touched a few levitating raindrops, and looked at the lighting mid flash How she how she *changed* me. Even the repentant suffered my wrath. There was a time when this would be acid, or even something stronger than bleach. To melt those below and hear their pitiful cries</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lamentation of countless trillions of beings singing the song we wrote together, with I the dark half, and my butterfly, the hopeful. To punish all who ever committed a sin enough to be here How this place was my church, and the worshipers, the fearful masses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t give a Single fuck about that now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I encourage her I could teach her? I caught onto how cooking works within minutes, but there is no point to making something so trivial. We cannot gain sustenance from it. Our followers feed us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I told her &#39;it was for the best&#39;, she would lament every time she&#39;s given and offering. I restarted my realm. None would know I did this anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to quit entirely butterfly Just no more substitutions. If you don&#39;t have the mortal ingredient, then we can&#39;t make it.&#34; I said patting her back. &#34;Would that suffice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rubbed her tear-stained eyes. &#34;It does husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Tonight, we will make dinner and watch TV like they do. Would you like to pick back up on garbage reality TV?&#34; I asked. &#34;We could watch The Great British Bake off.&#34; I offered. &#34;To be fair, that one has been my favorite a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought I didn&#39;t have time for such a thing. I don&#39;t, but I can&#39;t let her be alone so filled with grief and guilt. She hates that she has done this to them for so long, but I was honestly glad I finally said something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was a fool Had she killed our children, she would have never forgiven herself, even though they go to our realms, even little Samira.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she seen how green Willow became, or how sick Tyson got She would still have been sorrowful enough to tarnish Her luster would have vanished, and I would be to blame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had I not come to the playful, annoying summons of my Herold, I would have had to our middle child bring his niece-in-law to my feet and with Kaizen in hell, there would be two generals not three above. That would not be good Even separated, they are still a trio, an undefeatable one. They just don&#39;t know it.</p>
