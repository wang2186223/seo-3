                <p>chapter to be here, unless she was watching Tamriel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would be to make sure his loyalties were Above, not here. They were likely too late for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The energy of this place needs to be drained of both properties before the land is stable. This wound, unlike others, actually hurts Lia. It is a thorn in her side So we must remove it, not squabble.&#34; Said Titafia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, before I&#39;m severed in twain for an investigation of where my loyalties are &#34; He grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s only right. With Contradiction gone, there is no need for you to remain.&#34; She said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew I shouldn&#39;t have. He is the enemy, but he does aid me. &#34;You forget I am the Horned One&#39;s 1st General.&#34; I flexed my aura a moment. It was greater than hers. &#34;It &#39;sonly natural that he wish to protect at Least his son and the mortals above.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We managed to convert a few layers of the dungeons into proper living quarters. It won&#39;t be done until next month, but when it is, they&#39;ll have their own homes, magical demi realm to wonder, and basically if they never left the security station, they&#39;d never know. They&#39;d have about 20 acres to roam when it was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Lord asks much of his soldiers, but had you followed instructions like I did, your wife would have been a unicorn, and your children would be fully pure. Pure, And unchangeable by the Night&#39;s evil touch.&#34; She hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You go to far.&#34; I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me. I forget I must work with demonic entities to solve this issue.&#34; She said looking at me with a small smile. It seemed as if the apology was genuine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re too self-righteous for my taste. It does not matter so long as they serve.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be defended by a General of Hell&#34; Tamriel asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All Hell&#39;s army is in my palm. I may summon whom I please, even the Layer Lords. I have no qualms about doing it either.&#34; I said sternly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A mighty burden But since you have not done such a thing, you&#39;re honorable enough.&#34; Tamriel said stoically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the while, his son said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sentinel did not fit within the ranks of Haven, nor the humans of Urth, but he still tried to keep the peace. That was good enough for me. We walked deeper into long tunnels and corridors that went further still About 15 stories below ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see the bed where Contradiction must have slept  It was covered in slime, and stunk of rotted fruit. The decayed, sweet smell made flies and gnats while worms that ate dirt writhed in the stone, eating it as if it were soft earth. The torches here let off coldness, however, it was actually kind of steamy and hot in here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was damp, yet the water didn&#39;t wet my clothes. It was cold, yet I sweat from the unnatural temperature. There were other cells down here, but the corpses of them were stuck in permanent horror. He&#39;d ate them, soul and all I assume it&#39;s why humans originally couldn&#39;t stay here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If normal supernatural monsters didn&#39;t devour them, Contradiction did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I fed him to keep him quiet.&#34; Said Sentinel. &#34;The witches maintained the barrier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will draw the holy energy, you absorb the hellish.&#34; Said Tamriel. &#34;You did what you could son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish to investigate the victims closer.&#34; Said Titafia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do too.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were of all status, and walks of life. Some were farmed, but they held fewer signs of decay. He probably found them bland.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stone walls sweat as the stench of holy magic was replaced with only sulfur. The angels chanted something in Latin, knowing some spell to take it from this place. I just held out my hand and absorbed the demonic energy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It gave me a vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the basement of a grand cathedral, in Rome, Contradiction was born but it was not a joyous one. He was born with four arms and multi splotched skin His mother was human. She only knew she laid with Arviel, not that this particular demigod would be strange. A babe born with teeth, needing meat</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held her baby when he was delivered and she lamented, crying bitter tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is that thing?!&#34; Said someone in old-style priest&#39;s robes I saw this through Contradiction&#39;s infant eyes It was his mother rejecting him, but she didn&#39;t willingly hand him over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lord what did I do to receive this creature?&#34; she said as she hugged him. &#34;Yet he is still my son I was a virgin when he took me He could still-&#34; She was cut off. Men did not value women&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It holds the Lord&#39;s mark but it&#39;s deformed and distorted. She must be a Witch!&#34; Pointed a priest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your harlot ways must have tarnished the Lords blessed child!&#34; Accused one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Witch!&#34; Screamed another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snatching the boy out her arms, they took him and covered her in holy oil,  He watched his mother be burned alive while being taken away He was placed in a cage in the church then moved here, in stasis forever shunned and feared He didn&#39;t even get a name.</p>
