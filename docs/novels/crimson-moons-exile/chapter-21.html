                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should go back to your home Flora.&#34; Said Kaizen. His horns were out, and his head was tilted slightly to the side. I don&#39;t know what she&#39;d said before we showed up, but he was clearly pissed off at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The council will hear of this!&#34; She hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was going to leave, but before she could finish turning around, he was in front of her path back to her house so fast, it was as if he teleported He was a literal blur of red lightning. &#34;See. You&#39;ll be a feather pillow depending on which council you&#39;re speaking of.&#34; He said with folded arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Homeowner&#39;s Association you Idiot!&#34; She screamed. &#34;Move! It&#39;s bad enough I have to smell your sulfurous scent!&#34; She marched around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there confused. She wasn&#39;t at all intimidated and if she wasn&#39;t being a bitch, I&#39;d be impressed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well that was pleasant. Anyway. Venison Roast&#39;s ready!&#34; He shouted and there were cheers. Me and Valery walked past Kaizen, but he stopped Yuka by taking the groceries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for helping the girls I didn&#39;t think they&#39;d bring back so much.&#34; He said shaking wrists with the werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just doin&#39; my job You wouldn&#39;t happen to have a spot available for me and mine would ya?&#34; Yuka said with a bow. &#34;I may be a Rogue, but I am still loyal to the crown.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then your life is better spent elsewhere.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;I am here because I killed my own pack for this one.&#34; He said putting me under his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Half my soul is also delicate as frost&#39;s first kiss I have a witch mate I know how frail the Luna is. I understand your struggle and I Disagree with the King&#39;s ruling but as a wolf who swears to his prince.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;She is my mate half my soulare you alright knowing that my instincts supersede my reasoning?&#34; He asked seriously. &#34;I will not ask you, nor any wolf to swear to me unless you understand this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They shared a silent glare a long time There was no communication between them, neither verbal or body language The other wolves that seemed to come from all over the neighborhood must have heard him, as they vouched with nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can vow to this I understand. plus, it protects my small, frail mate, Regardless of your warning Witches are not strong like us they are basically humans who can cast magic body wise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mate was rejected by my pack because she is a vampire.&#34; Said one of the men cutting his hand. &#34;With my blood, I vow loyalty to the Horned Blood. I am Emmit Former Shadow Warrior... Should I leave these lands I will be beheaded&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were not the same one was blue, and the other was brown. His black hair held a single silver streak, and his dark skin seemed to radiate. A shadowy presence. I didn&#39;t like it it was like you Knew he was a killer. He gave off the same vibe as Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me wonder did other supernatural creatures feel like this naturally because they were hunters I also .I just Knew he was a man eater...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;Call them here and any else you two think won&#39;t be a problem If I am to be Alpha like everyone else wants, I&#39;ll make sure I get to know their faces.&#34; He said sternly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have a private BookFace Group.&#34; Said Yuka, pulling out his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come with me.&#34; Said Kaizen. I was still under his arms and I wondered was this a werewolf thing I didn&#39;t say anything because I figured it was best to let him handle his people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It also could have made it worse. I could kind of feel his stress Not just be aware of it it felt almost like it was mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen, I don&#39;t think Yuka has any ulterior motives.&#34; I said being handed a plate by Ace. There was one for Kaizen too they gave him an entire beef leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank&#39;s Ace.&#34; He said walking with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll see to the rest of us sir.&#34; Said Ace, running off into the crowd of growing supernaturals. I made sure to thank him too before he was out of earshot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat down in a lawn chair. We were in the back yard, while the people I were more familiar with, stood closer to us. Kaizen seemed to be looking somewhere to chat in private.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can see his soul Yuka&#39;s clean. I&#39;m just worked up about the fact that my Human mate is surrounded by supernatural people I don&#39;t know If anyone tries anything, I know I won&#39;t be able to control myself.&#34; He said kissing me on the forehead. &#34;But that being said, let&#39;s enjoy the new forming pack&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey hey! Now that Alpha&#39;s got his cut, let&#39;s eat!&#34; Shouted Ace over the growing crowd. It wasn&#39;t long either before at least two or three hundred More people showed up to the house.and not all were wolves. Some were green or blue skinned, while others were unnaturally tall like Kaizen. They also had cow horns out. &#34;You have any words sir?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone looked somewhat excitedly for whatever speech he was going to give.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since everyone is so keen on making me Alpha, I&#39;ll be your Alpha.&#34; He said seriously. &#34;I am the direct blood of the Horned One. And for it I have committed actions that cast me out I deserve that. But I vow with my power, I will protect you all how I canand my mate. She is human, but she is your Luna.&#34; He said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MisfitMoon gives no fucks about stations, bloodlines, or species.&#34; Said one of the wolves, raising his can of elvish beer. There was a lot of agreement</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oi! I&#39;ve never been in a &#39;pack&#39;, but fuck it! Welcome boss and lady boss!&#34; Shouted a really tall, blue skinned man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People cheered, and Kaizen looked really surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then to MisfitMoon.&#34; Said Kaizen, raising up the entire leg of beef that had to be Pounds of food He took a flaming bite with a small growl I could see his teeth become black, and the roasted meat was cooked a little more well done from it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost wondered if this celebration was ok since we were outlaws I still was wrapping my head around it, but I wouldn&#39;t say anything. I know Kaizen heard me, but for now, we all ate, drank and were merry well they had alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still. I couldn&#39;t Relax with the drinking part. all I could think about with its smell, were my friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like to go inside?&#34; Asked Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. I think I do.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll come with you.&#34; He said somehow Done. All that was left of the cow leg, and he bit into it like a damn candy bar. The Crunch made my hair stand on end. He snapped a piece off the end. &#34;Want some marrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; I yelled horrified, and a few people laughed at me. However, he looked concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry&#34; He said sheepishly with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright.&#34; I said walking with him inside. He finished the bone by the time we got to our master bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was beautiful in there the heavy looking wood furniture matched the dark wood of the bed. All of it was carved, filled with leaves, gold accents, and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crown molding and canopy bed was over the top as if I were in a palace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The colors are wrong.&#34; He said with a chuckle. &#34;They put crimson and black sheets, the castle&#39;s colors are black and gold.&#34; He said picking me up. He laid me on the bed and covered me with the satin blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sleepy.&#34; I complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too bad. Get a little rest little mate you don&#39;t have to drink to hang out with us you don&#39;t have to overextend your social meter for my sake either.&#34; He said kissing me on the forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that I relaxed a little I was sleepy he handed me the key to the door by putting it around my neck It looked Old, but it was surprisingly light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>----Kaizen-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left her to sleep, and she locked the door from the inside like I told her to. My grandfather wished to speak with me but as far as the others knew, the &#39;wolf&#39; with dark brown hair the one who looked nearly identical to me was just a &#39;normal&#39; man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My grandson.&#34; He said pressing his forehead to mine, not revealing his horns. He had his hands on my shoulders, while grandmother hugged me round my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also appeared to look &#39;normal&#39;. Instead of her moon colored skin, she was about the same skin tone as my mate, with long silver hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had so many questions, but I also knew they would not answer them not Yet. Not until my situation was resolved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s the party?&#34; I asked, seeing him smile. I was correct</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very Nice.&#34; Said Grandfather. &#34;Know as my one of my marked champions, you may never die my son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Know son that you have our blessings.&#34; Said grandmother. She looked about ready to cry for whatever they had planned for us. &#34;. May your instincts no longer rule you.&#34;  Said the Moon Goddess</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My dear, they are mine to bless.&#34; Said the Horned One. He petted her hair, and she looked into his eyes pleadingly, but we both knew grandfather would not relent on his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For her to attempt to bless me that way, it meant she thought she made a mistake. For that I gave her a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma do not be ashamed of my actions, nor my soul I am a monster as much as I am of Horned blood but do not try to change me. I am happy with being myself.&#34; I said seeing my grandfather grin</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He marked us as his the day we were born we belong to the Horned One. If I were to die, I will not go to grandmother&#39;s realm. I will be one of his generals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My blood. You impress me.&#34; He said with a chuckle. &#34;You will need your truth for your brother.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;I will reward you with one question since you quelled my butterfly&#39;s tears.&#34; He had grandma under his arm, tucking her away to hold onto him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We three knew Tyson would Not bend on his law</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only real question I would have for the King of Hell. Would be Why</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I knew the answer to separate us</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All our lives, we did everything together. We were an unstoppable unit we were our own pack. But with that unity, would likely be confusion</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way I could have the love of my life at my side, if the bond connection went to siblings. It could have been too much of a strain on trying to remain as we were, while at the same time, adding three more to our trio in the form of soulmate bonds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meaning that we could have fallen in love with other people, beyond our soulmate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandfather please hold your favor as a vagabond in this world, I may see you sooner than either of us like.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made it so that only your siblings, uncles or father may return you but whoever does such a thing better have a Good reason.&#34; He said his piece neither loud nor angrily. But he radiated power. I doubt an Old One of any stature would have missed it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For my brother&#39;s sake I hope this ends peacefully.</p>
