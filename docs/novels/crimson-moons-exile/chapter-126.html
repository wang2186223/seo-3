                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sentinel was at his desk typing, and I had one as well. He said nothing the entire time, not out of rudeness, but he wanted to make it clear that he wasn&#39;t going to interfere. He was making his weekly report and sending it I think to either Uriel or Nanatori, the Standing Elf King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you mind if I knit in here?&#34; Asked Gloria. I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead, little wolf.&#34; Said Sentinel huskily, then he cleared his throat. He didn&#39;t mind that she was 5 months. &#34;I have no issue with it.&#34; He said more sternly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept glancing at her, though I doubt anything would actually come of it. He saw them as not only mortals, but not of his master. Had she been a light creature, maybe he would go after her But I&#39;m not sure . I could see her kind of blush at the attention any girl would. Sentinel was *Objectively More Handsome than an elf*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know you could knit.&#34; I mentioned casually. I figured to change the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yeah, I learned from my brother. Gaven still makes traditional clothes and blankets. Our parents are from France. They taught us how to even make lace but that requires a LOT of work.&#34; She mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled out a blue ball of yarn and her needle, and silently did that in the corner. I was on my computer, pecking away in the stillness, knowing full well that my next appointment would be annoying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lunch was nice but now I had to do the other part of this, the civil court stuff. We had many different people with different levels of not only ownership of their homes, but also class. Today I had to deal with the high elves, an exile who wanted to implement new H.O.A. enforcements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They wanted stricter rules, but I was against that. He came in, head high, sporting his metallic gold skin. I believe his hidden form makes him a pale man, paler than me if it were even possible</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hair was white, and his eyes were silver. He looked at Sentinel briefly, then me, and nodded his head ever so slightly. It was the royal nod, so he was not only a high elf, but probably formally in the royal court. He was also about as tall as Jerold, though incredibly lean, and slightly toned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome, have a seat.&#34; I told them. The chairs were comfortable, but they snubbed the appearance of them I guess they were too plain. &#34;I&#39;m Willow, the Horned Kitsune, mate to First General Kaizen of Hell, Second Duke of Demons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We shook wrists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am Puil&#39;zemmit the Gilded One, though I am no longer 12th in line for the throne.&#34; His words they were confusing. You could hear two separate octaves as he spoke His voice was low, but there were high tones with it too&#34;I disagreed with Sagrinal, my father is the Second Seat, 11th in line. I opposed his official marriage to Skylia, as he was to have married my sister, as agreed by our peoples. I figure to get that out the way, should you be curious my lady.&#34; He said that too so he could tell me without saying it, that he was an elitist</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also, I couldn&#39;t pronounce his name. It&#39;s impossible to unless you can speak with two tones, as I Doogled this quickly Apparently, those tones give meaning to their words and emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see your proposition of F129-A and B Gilded One. You want the removal of and zoning of commoners. You would like us to not only house them in the new area of the pack recently purchased, as well as bar them from permanent residence? I won&#39;t do that.&#34; I said putting this on the table and sliding it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lord Kaizen would see reason.&#34; Said Puil&#39;zemmit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked down at me so disapproving and disappointed that if not for my minor Luna training, I might have broken eye contact. I stayed proud. Elves value pride</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As I said, both of these are denied. I&#39;m not going to displace nearly 30% of the wolf population and about 20% of the other races so you don&#39;t have to look at commoners.&#34; I said without growling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My lady, we shouldn&#39;t have to be surrounded by rabble. They stay up late, drink every afternoon, and make noise all night.&#34; He complained. &#34;I&#39;m so tired.&#34; That part dipped in both tones, harmonizing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See, That&#39;s different. I can make ordinance laws about excessive noise, littering, and prowling in the residential zone.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you really?&#34; Both tones went up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Teens under 16 need to be in by midnight. That gives them enough time to hunt. Adults can be out as late as they want, but any reports of ACTIVE and purposeful disruption, they can be told to go home the first time, fined.. hmm. $200 the second time? That sounds fair. They&#39;ll be fined $500 and spend a night in the jail for the third. Littering $1000. Noise ordinance starts at 2am. I would make it earlier, but there are too many nocturnal people here for that.&#34; I said thinking out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was flabbergasted. &#34;I thought you&#39;d dismiss me after my request.&#34; He bowed his head. Both tones were high. I think despite his stoic face, that he was happy about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reminded me of Eternya. His passive face is snooty too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, but you shouldn&#39;t think so little of common folk. They&#39;re the ones who keep this place running. They&#39;re the ones who literally risk life and limb so you can complain in the first place.&#34; I looked up his address, 2283 Palm Cove He was next to Warriors, the day crew. They were on either side of him, Warrior Haverty, and Warrior Kip&#39;s homes. They each had kids and such as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think little of them. My people, high elves, speak as we are. We are the chosen of our people, holding no blood lower. My presence here is a gift.&#34; He said with one high and the other low. I think it was to demonstrate his rank. With his people, High elves are a recessive trait. The moment they marry anyone else, they make an elemental elf, or a common elf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your presence is annoying.&#34; I blurted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand, you are a kitsune, married to a demigod. You are more than high enough to understand in both station and blood.. You are at least as highborn as me.&#34; He scratched his head. He looked confused. His tone reflected that, wavering as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So was I Were high elves snobs or not?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t either.&#34; I said with a raised brow. &#34;I don&#39;t understand how you see everyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, they are lesser, but this is my home. It is my responsibility to insure the integrity of such an illustrious place stay coveted. It is also my responsibility to protect these little magicless animal-people with my magic, and knowledge. I teach the witches spells that in turn aid in their barrier development. I work with the Elves as well. They need me even though I am exiled by choice.&#34; He said with a humph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;..  So, are you satisfied then Gilded One?&#34; I asked. This might clarify this confusing man</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. If they can&#39;t move, I&#39;ll tolerate this if they behave.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;I&#39;m just fed up with being kept up with the parties. I work from home for Lord Elli&#39; Nande, the Whistling One it&#39;s embarrassing to yawn in a meeting, or have others hear their damn howlingYes they actually howl at 4 and 5 in the morning.&#34; He hissed with deep tones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a problem.&#34; I said looking up their phone numbers. &#34;I&#39;ll shoot a pack text about howling in city limits. We can link; there&#39;s no reason to make noise outside people&#39;s homes at that hour but your wording is combative.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is High English.&#34; He said stoically. &#34;Though I suppose for the unchosen it may be too harsh Do you think that is why they torment me?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you were my neighbor, and you called me an &#39;animal-people, commoner, or rabble. Yeah I can see why they haze you.&#34; I said seeing him nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t. I never learned Common. Do you believe if I request a formal request for pardon and reconciliation dinner, that they would attend and accept?&#34; He asked. This time I could tell he tried dropping the two tone, but I don&#39;t think he could, not fully. I still heard it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s worth a try. Those are you neighbors until one of you moves. So make peace in the meantime.&#34; I said shaking his wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, my lady.&#34; He got up, and did a bow to the waist before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to say something so bad Luna. But I thought if I did, that it would undermine you&#34; she said out her mouth, but I think she was the first thought I heard. Maybe there were others, but until now I wasn&#39;t looking at her mouth Not move. Having a whole conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Or you&#39;d think I&#39;m trying to do your job. I can&#39;t afford to fuck this up I literally am here because of a whim on Alpha&#39;s part. Shit she&#39;s looking at me. What&#39;s that face; did I mess up?/ She didn&#39;t say that but I heard it in my head clear as day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know if I should respond to it Kaizen usually does, though he does often comment that its rude. She bowed her head, and I nodded like he does so she could raise it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to worry about me. I don&#39;t really care about rank; I don&#39;t have to.&#34; I said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re sweet.&#34; Siad Sentinel. He must have heard too. &#34;We both hear you dear. You&#39;re fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hear me?&#34; She mumbled, realizing that the myth of elders was real.</p>
