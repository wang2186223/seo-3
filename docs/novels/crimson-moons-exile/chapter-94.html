                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh they stink!&#34; Complained Kaizen. I was in the bathroom with the nurses, while he cleaned the first of many potty breaks &#34;Come on guys, save that stuff for mama.&#34; He joked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Hey! No fair!] I barked in wolf I was surprised I could do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But they&#39;re cute. You&#39;ll forgive them.&#34; He sang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[.Don&#39;t abuse their power!] I giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was happier they were this way than babies puppies are cute Babies are cute Too but I think I felt like this because of what I was now. They had potty pads, thankfully, since we planned for if they didn&#39;t have forms yet</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being born like this was hereditary, and he was a natural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My lady, I believe it&#39;s safe to shift now.&#34; Said the nurse. I&#39;d been here overnight, and most of the wounds on my body were healed somewhat, but I was also incredibly sore</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the nurses helped me shift by encouraging me. I didn&#39;t shift much, so I was slow also the pain made me hesitate and wince. I was proud of myself. The scar across my belly was a thick line, but the stitches were supposed to stay on the skin until they disappeared on their own. &#39;Dr. Sampson&#39; used dissolvable sutures, and marked my bellybutton like Kaizen&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He did such a good job.&#34; Said Nurse Una. She was a raven haired nine tailed fox It was her blood that was used for my blood transfusion. That and the Horned One gave me some he brought. Demon fox blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know the difference between the two, but apparently the combination was what I needed to have any energy. This also meant that if I needed it again, Kaizen would probably have to take a trip Below to save me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods it felt good though to get clean... I had to be careful with the stitches, but it was going to be fine. I knew how to take care of them, because Kaizen Doogled it to be sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[My mistress if you need anything, the fox kin will aid you.] Said Una. She didn&#39;t say that in wolf, but I understood her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fox dialect is so high pitched.&#34; Complained another nurse, who was a werewolf. &#34;Una you have to teach me sometime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The werewolf was a nurse practitioner. She was the leader of the entire nurse unit, and saw to me personally. No one told her to do this, she volunteered to come in on her day off with Una.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll be able to? But I&#39;ll try.&#34; She giggled. &#34;I mean I can speak bear, and theirs is so low pitch. Hmm&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all paused a moment to think on it. Maybe it was possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. But regardless, I&#39;d love to learn eagle.&#34; Giggled the werewolf. She joked about Eternya, but I know he heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m married now ladies.&#34; He chuckled, and they all huffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We only want a ride my lord.&#34; Shouted Una.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not a Ferris-wheel.&#34; I could hear Elinore&#39;s facepalm. &#34;I&#39;m a roller coaster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Out.&#34; She said shaking her head coming in. &#34;We brought tea for you mistress.&#34; Elinore smiled. &#34;Oh and Una I have your foxglove biscuits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh! I smell black lavender!&#34; Yipped Una. &#34;Did you really go through all that trouble?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It smells so nice. Like vanilla.&#34; Smiled the werewolf nurse. Her nametag read Quinn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t think of that.&#34; Elinore gave it a sniff. &#34;Like white vanilla.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s so many herbs I have no idea about.&#34; I smiled, taking the towel Una had. I was tenderly dried, while Valery could have been here, but I sent her home so she could be with her baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flora at the moment was in the human town to get more pup supplies. She wasn&#39;t satisfied with what we had, since she figured more was better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen looked so upset at seeing the incision, but he held me before I could put on clothes. The pups kind of snored a little, and they were huddled together. I don&#39;t know how I could tell them apart, since they were identical twins, but I was happy I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave us.&#34; Kaizen commanded huskily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sir!&#34; Giggled Una.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all giggled when he kissed me on the forehead. He held me closely, and his embrace was like he was holding glass</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need anything?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m alright.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have fresh meat.&#34; He offered raw meat was on the hospital table by the bed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t-&#34; He cut me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Raw meat aids in healing. It&#39;s just beef. Have the bone too.&#34; He said taking it and breaking it open with his grip. He didn&#39;t let me go; he was so tall it was well within his reach. &#34;The marrow is especially good for you, but I do intend on hunting later. Organ meat is high in iron.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated on that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held the slab of beef to my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop.&#34; I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Open wide.&#34; He sang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ew!&#34; I squealed, but he was convincing My instincts activated when it got close enough with it, and it It was actually good The taste of raw beef had a flavor. I felt really good afterwards too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the bone.&#34; He said firmly. His grin as he sang it was so smug I wanted to bite him, but instead I used all the biteforce I had to gnaw on it. I ate the marrow. I felt like a wild animal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I also think since they&#39;ll need my milk, that this will be my diet for a while.&#34; I said thinking out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup, but mom also had stuff she liked after she ate what she needed for us.&#34; He said looking at his phone. &#34;They&#39;re actually headed here before they hit Tyson&#39;s place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, what time?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, like in thirty more minutes.&#34; He said looking on his phone. &#34;They could be here Now, but father hates using his powers and last he wound up inside a wall according to Grace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sounded painful, and terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It probably was.&#34; He said with a snort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat gently on the bed with Kaizen, but he wanted me to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not tired.&#34; I complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get sleep while the getting&#39;s good.&#34; He warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right.&#34; I said thinking about it. They still cry and need us They were more helpless than a normal baby, since they couldn&#39;t take care of themselves, even regulate their body temperature yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>----Kaizen-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father stood at the threshold of the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in.&#34; I said with a smile. Dad was weird when it came to stuff like this He was so stern looking naturally, that I don&#39;t think the nurses noticed his smile. It was slight, but there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They look like you when you were born.&#34; He said picking them up. &#34;Welcome to the world, my grandsons. Aristaeus and Vexterios, with all those titles.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;I got to make their mates this time.&#34; He said proudly. &#34;I won&#39;t spoil it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; I said with a little surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but the Horned One did most of the work. I just kind of swirled soul stuff around.&#34; He admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still think it&#39;s sweet that you tried.&#34; Said mom. &#34;They&#39;re going to be their own race but to simplify it, they look like kitsune-wolf hybrids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awe you went and spoiled it.&#34; He said in disbelief. &#34;They&#39;re called vulpines. They will share your horns, with wolfish bodies, and solid colored fox tails. They&#39;re a little leaner than a wolf, but about the same size.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t help myself. I got to see.&#34; Mom clapped. &#34;They&#39;re so stinkin&#39; cute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t lie, that does sound kind of cool, but how&#39;d you get away with making more horned creatures? Or your Own race of people for that matter?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father made them, and gave them titles but I bless them as well. May you never know the pain of hunger, heartbreak, nor blade mar your hide.&#34; He said holding them high in the air, ignoring me. They glowed red a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bryson, you gave that blessing to Grace&#39;s pup too.&#34; She complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did. It&#39;s a really good one.&#34; He countered. &#34;No wait!&#34; He got peed on by both of them when he cradled them.. &#34;Every time!&#34; he skedaddled to a puppy pad, walking like a duck to dodge the onslaught of my boys</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Me and mom both got a good laugh out of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I take it that they like the blessing.&#34; Said mom with a cheeky grin. &#34;I was going to talk to Willow, but it seems like she&#39;s doing alright. I stayed with Grace to let her know it&#39;ll be ok.. and I just didn&#39;t feel right only attending to her needs. Samira and Willow need me too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that face. The weight of the world was on mother&#39;s shoulders again. She worked so hard to raise us right, and I bet she worried about us, because all of us were new parents at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas, nor Asanguis had any children They merely watched for threats. They didn&#39;t know a damn thing about helping, but it didn&#39;t stop him from coming in here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha, they got you too.&#34; Smiled Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father took off his shirt, and put it in the bathroom sink. &#34;Oh, whatever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You blessed them well brother. It&#39;s my turn. I know now what I will bless all my little nephews. As Three, I bless these twins with honor, integrity, and honesty to match their strength. May they do what&#39;s right, rather than what is ordered of them. May they keep their vows, and treat their mates as we treat ours As the 4th and 5th Generals of the Horned One, they will need it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lights flickered with the blessing of Xaxas, as he is much stronger than father, who I believe is Four Their power, and being so high made each brother targets in their own right Each was cheated in their own way during the war</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now with peace and their power in their hands, instead of using all that strength for evil, the Sons of the Horned One lived quiet, mortal lives. They had mortal mates as I do When technically, if I wanted, I could have a home in Hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wouldn&#39;t be hard either the Top Layer had fields and fields of black grass and lush forest. Demons that slithered and skittered there weren&#39;t allowed to harm the innocent. They bought food and drink at stores as we do, and had humble lives with honest paychecks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for being an Alpha here, I&#39;d ask her about it There was nothing Really holding me here either, other than the living thralls I turned with my blood I couldn&#39;t leave them here, but with Willow so clearly unable to defend herself, it was tempting.</p>
