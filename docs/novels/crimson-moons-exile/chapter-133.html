                <p>A/n: They sent him home at 5pm. Jeff&#39;s alright but he will still need the big surgery on the 9th, both kidneys are infected and have stones the size of a quarter so the stent/ nephrostomy stuff bypasses that. I thank yall for the well wishes and prayers. Life happens. Neither of us are exactly &#39;healthy&#39;. This is a chronic condition he&#39;s had since 16 or so. He&#39;ll be 39 in September. Oh my god we&#39;re old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat with Bryson. My poor brother, raised mortal holding such notions as mortal feelings in all honesty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I half imagine if in private, he&#39;d have shed a tear for these filthy, terrible mortals. He couldn&#39;t see what they&#39;d doneor will do if left unchecked. He doesn&#39;t need to know. They *killed* this planet, and laid ruin to the land, but that wasn&#39;t why they needed to fucking go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were too close to inventing portal magic realm crossing portal magic. The influence of the energy of this place will poison the land. Bryson knew that much; no one hid anything from him. He saw the same generalization that Kaizen saw, but their hearts are soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t count how many &#39;Harmony&#39;s&#39; I&#39;ve killed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is not easy but they are not her. They are merely projects of father. What if Harmony was a pureblood? What if she was human? What if she was a witch, or a half witch like his favorite, or if she was dark hearted, not sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That one That one *hurt* to see, since her sweet shyness made me lift my claws off the worlds in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw Isabelle.&#34; He said in the silence. &#34;Her name was Iris here&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not your mate, but rather an alternate version, more or less a combination of random appearance and curiosity of Arviel in this case. There&#39;s a Lia, Willow, Samira, and Aureus here as well, though they are all dead now.&#34; I said putting a hand on his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was here mostly to watch him. He&#39;s FreshThis is his first world. This was the first time he devours the evil, and they will be the first souls for him to manage, and purge of their corruption. He made a people but he has no fucking idea what he&#39;s doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s my job to help. I&#39;m not a *good* teacher, but it will be more than what I had during my first reign</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I I don&#39;t feel bad for them like I thought I would.&#34; He admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That kind of pity is for mortals. We rid both Courts of a troublesome world that WILL spread the horrors you see here. A meteor was scheduled to hit this place. You saw what they built under our feet.&#34; I warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They can&#39;t do this to another planet.&#34; Said Bryson. &#34;They have technology nobody has, so they would have dominated all the billions of other peoples everywhere else.&#34; He still hesitated to eat, but this was baby&#39;s mash. I encouraged him by putting it into a cup for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made it taste like a good cup of hot coffee. Bryson likes it black, Foldgers specifically if only for the price. That and we were at the top of the planet. If I could get cold, I&#39;d be dead. Him too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sipped, and I muted the screams. He is not ready for that yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a good brother I know they scream. I feel the vibration.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. I&#39;ll fetch Tyson. Killing Sam breaks his heart.&#34; I said getting up. The souls would keep filling the cup, and taste of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boys were distraught, but they need this too. Being in charge, holding this much power has a price. They must shed their notions of mortality. They aren&#39;t mortal. I am Judgment given a shape. It&#39;s what I do Bryson is Vengeance and Retribution punishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were *made* to stop this kind of shit. As &#39;horrid&#39; as they think I am for not holding remorse or mercy, they must understand that before this, I toppled worlds because I felt like it. That includes our home world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I collect Tyson and Kaizen, I&#39;ll send them home, and kill all the gods here, mash them up, and give it all to my brother. He deserves to be who he is meant to be, because I know he can handle it. He has a natural high sense of morality. It is why he is Four, that and Asanguis got his godhood last, therefor it only fair he be Five, War Six, and soon Lia will be Seven, and mother Eight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There is so much consolidation that comes with uniting concepts from all over like this, but it is needed. Lia shouldn&#39;t be tied to just one world, nor mother one moon if they are married to men who share One.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Kaizen----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you trying to pick a concubine?&#34; Asked Xaxas behind me. He was ready for this to be over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Can I?&#34; I asked. &#34;Obviously not for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did I ask for something so fucking Awful?! I felt like the *worst* piece of shit on this planet</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. That&#39;s not a bad idea.&#34; He vanished and came back. &#34;They said the planet is 100% human, but none of them please Arviel. The Light Court&#39;s presence on your land will end with the *bloodline* of the original men you house. Do with that as you will. Pick some pretty ones. Nobody likes a fucking butterface. Claw the Horned One&#39;s mark on their shoulder, and they&#39;ll end up in your little fake town thingy you and Eskaal made.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas vanished again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t or rather won&#39;t keep all of you.&#34; I said firmly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mercy.&#34; Many mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was tasked with annihilating this world, and you saw. Everyone else is dead already&#34; The only one screwing around was me.. &#34;But I also won&#39;t lie to you. Any I save Stand if you are willing to marry a random human on my world. My lands hold angels, but I need mortals to keep them there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Will we be slaves?&#34; Asked one girl. She had a thick iron collar around her neck. That would make sense though. A world this advanced abuses the weak to pamper the strong one of the many reasons why it should be toppled I wish there was another way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even she held an X. It made me wonder what she did</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go.&#34; Stood a random woman. She didn&#39;t hold an X, not a solid one</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe some of these X&#39;s were from the abandonment of Arviel He wanted nothing to do with them, so they by default I guess go to Tarteron? I&#39;ll ask later. I removed her collar, along with her friend. They could come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I will carve the Mark of the Adversary on your shoulder the Lord of Thunder does not accept your people any longer.&#34; Here Arviel&#39;s name was Thndrus, though these people merely saw him as a mascot a fairy tale since he does not come here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many looked concerned that he was real or any of us for that matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still want it.&#34; Mary said firmly. She wore a mechanic style uniform; her name tag gave her name. &#34;Get up Martin&#34; She pulled her fellow mechanic&#39;s arm, but the white-haired man wouldn&#39;t budge. He looked young, but here they held technology that extended life by about a hundred years Their dictators ruled for a century, further corrupting the land. He was 142, but looked 55. That part I knew from scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going to another world to be someone&#39;s flesh-light.&#34; Martin hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.. I actually need only females I cannot allow full couples to come, or you will pass your nonacceptance curse to your next generation. But I will also say this: If you find *any* of the men lacking, in character or body, you are free to leave them at any time. The only thing you can&#39;t do is leave the territory, or venture out at night. I&#39;ll kill the mortal that makes trouble if I have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have robot dogs too? If we try to leave our assigned sector, you are ripped apart.&#34; Asked Wisteria even the way she speaks is like Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For this to work by the wording blending must happen. But if I&#39;m going to do this, it&#39;s going to be done fucking right. I don&#39;t mind killing a few of them if they&#39;re rude to them. Many stood with Mary, but I would only take 10. I figured that was a good number</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked the ones who knew the least of their world over the &#39;prettiest&#39;. I don&#39;t want to make trouble. Eskaal&#39;s magic WILL stop them from being able to even make human contraptions, but I didn&#39;t want to risk bringing this technology</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was as gentle as I could be. I felt like a surgeon on such soft skin; I hated it. I hated that this was how I could keep the Light Court on my territory These women would get no protection from Sentinel, but their children, and hopefully future husbands will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last one was the &#39;Willow&#39; of this world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t keep Wisteria</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should have never landed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one they who were marked vanished grandfather got 10 new souls; that&#39;s what he got out of it I got a way for the humans to keep living on without taking from the Meat Market but I still cannot keep that woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait!&#34; She yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would not share my reasoning with her. I will never see her again. Well, there&#39;s a slim chance, but I never venture to father&#39;s forest realm It&#39;s all trees. There is no steel, copper, ore nor technology there. It was designed to be a misty place where horned volpines will one day hunt the wicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I assumed though for now they may be processed somewhere else, and sent in his at a later time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I teleported high in the sky and launched my arrow. I waited all 13 seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood tears fell for little Wisteria Her only crime in my eyes was that she was too adjacent to my most precious beloved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she stayed in the pack looking like Willow, I would have to live with not only seeing her with another, but more importantly that WILL cause pack disruption. They will treat her differently, even though they would know by scent. She also carries an X like everyone else, but as I watched, the image of her terrified face would haunt me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyson looked just as disturbedXaxas appeared with him in the air I half figured out the whole floating thing Kind of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You too?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Yeah.&#34; I said as Xaxas teleported us home. I guess he figured we&#39;d seen enough. When I saw Willow and the boys I embraced them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Asked Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing just let me collect myself first.&#34; I said quietly. Even as a kitsune, she is still so small It takes no effort. I hated that I knew that That it takes no effort to obliterate an entire planet in a half hour, 45 because of my hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This world is a sanctuary but if anything ever happens, I&#39;m taking my entire pack to Tartaron. I won&#39;t risk losing her. Not HerNot the boys. This was my penance all over again.</p>
