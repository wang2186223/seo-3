                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could tell that I&#39;d been taken to possibly the most expensive supernatural fine dining restaurant he could book I knew he probably didn&#39;t even pay money for it either, because with them, money only holds so much value.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly the chef looked like a normal fox except the hands. They were like a shifted lycan&#39;s, but he chopped carrots so finely that I could see light through them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took two sniffs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re Here!&#34; my trainer beamed. I doubt I&#39;d be able to meet him right Now, but he&#39;s supposed to see us this week. I was told teleportation magic is honestly reserved for only a select few. Even a mile away can tank most other people&#39;s energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen was kneeled to those who sat bowed their heads so low that their noses touched the table, and a waiter with black ram&#39;s horns rushed to seat us. So he was a goat-minotaur by how massive he was. Rare. I heard most times goat half-beasts are satyr. I saw them. They all had their legs out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This way young master.&#34; Bowed the bull smelling waiter. His nose ring had Scales on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wonder if he was a worshiper of Xaxas. He has a few, but I get it I mean. He *is* a god I&#39;m sure he does *some* god stuff to have followers. Right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xaxas is popular because he rules this planet. He&#39;s also pretty reasonable. He allows freedom and life so long as nobody&#39;s disrupting the balance.&#34; Said Kaizen once we were seated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you had to pic-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma.&#34; He blurted firmly. &#34;Her realm&#39;s nice and she&#39;s nice. Everyone else&#39;s realm is a part of Hell proper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. The master saved me.&#34; Said the minotaur. Now that I think of it. I bet his dad&#39;s a demon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now I *need* to hear this.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;Speak half demon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I I always suspected that.&#34; He mumbled. &#34;During the war the Church got ahold of me, and it just so happened that the Realm King passed through.&#34; He paused. &#34;I was on the RingThey sang as they burned me I screamed as it engulfed my hooves Even to this day, I hold no fur on the end of my tail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it&#39;s a whip.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ay master but I&#39;m grateful. Nobody else was coming to save me and I KNOW I was only saved by circumstance  Lord Xaxas killed the priests and fucked the priestesses, but he let me live.&#34; He showed us his tattoo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds about right.&#34; Kaizen rolled his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I vowed my loyalty, and he gave me his protection He doesn&#39;t remember me, I know that. I was an afterthought Heh, I distinctly remember being kicked in the face by the Beast Prince since I kneeled in the way but he is who I sacrifice my Thankful Day turkey to Should you ever have need of me sire, I am Ebonhorn the Flayer, though I do not know my father&#39;s line master.&#34; We were handed menus with a bow, and the minotaur left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His story didn&#39;t paint Xaxas as a hero or anything it made me see him in a bit of a different light  He&#39;s kinder than he realizes, because he didn&#39;t have to take Ebonhorn off the Ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw your memories mortal. I think I might be able to find out your lineage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you master.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank your father.&#34; Kaizen said thinking out loud. &#34;I&#39;ll ask and see if anyone knows a demon with the title of Flayer.&#34; Mumbled Kaizen. &#34;Demons only pass titles when they&#39;re strong enough to lead a battalion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a good person Kaizen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not. He&#39;s one of the fold. It&#39;s my job to make sure our people don&#39;t suffer.&#34; He said putting his hands on mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent of meat made my stomach growl. His too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess we should order?&#34; My mate kissed my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess? I don&#39;t know what I want.&#34; I looked around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed any dish to come to mind was available here. Shifting was allowed too, so even large shifters and trolls could sit in their own special area and enjoy a roasted cow with their mates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was even a brown dragon shifted. He didn&#39;t have arms though, only wings and legs. He had a cow leg, though it was sliced paper thin, and he dipped his meat in boiling soup on a stove neat. Hot Pot sounded awesome And it&#39;s something we can both have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This place is really nice.&#34; I mentioned. &#34;Do you want to do that?&#34; I asked referring to the dragon, happily dipping the bones in now. The cauldron placed in front of him had to be made to feed 20 people he was about 30 feet tall sitting.. This place was designed for supernaturals top to bottom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never tried that before either. I bet it&#39;s tender.&#34; He said waving his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My lord.&#34; Said Ebonhorn with a bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did I want to take him with us? I&#39;ll swing it by Kaizen later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll have what that wyvern&#39;s having. Non-mortal meats only though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah yes, the sampler. Our most popular dish sir. The broth is brewed for 3 days, infused with mana crystals from the In-Between. Would you like white or black magic infusions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Black.&#34; We both said at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, and I would love to add a bottle of Witches&#39; Brew: Toil n&#39; Trouble.&#34; Said Kaizen. That one was their wine selection. Neither of us had had it yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away sir.&#34; Ebonhorn bowed leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now this is hard.&#34; He held both my hands, trying to think of his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is?&#34; I asked a little cluelessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.I am only the wolf Willow. I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not the man you wished for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wha-&#34; He cut me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean too much. Please, let me finish before I chicken out.&#34; He huffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to feel special&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do though&#34; I looked away. The ring on my finger was worth more money than I&#39;d ever *imagine* on my hand yet it even shifts with me, becoming a bracelet I have a husband and children good ones I almost felt guilty that I didn&#39;t want more</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you don&#39;t.&#34; He huffed. &#34;For metrips are only places outside my territory Clothes are only raiment cars are tin cans that roll food is meat to be consumed. Money is paper. Like, I&#39;m already over losing the car.&#34; He sighed. &#34;I&#39;m Simple But those things *do* mean things to humans. I wanted to take you Below for a vacation not just for fun, and not to make you feel like a damn pup factory I don&#39;t want you to feel like you&#39;re with some big dumb meathead either, or a dog chasing tail.&#34; He huffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got some of the shifter&#39;s attention that was a really Really rude thing to say in public, but he never cares about that kind of thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen I don&#39;t think any of that.&#34; I held both his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m trying to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think I thought you were serious?&#34; I asked in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reassured him by squeezing both his hands. &#34;I. I&#39;ve been a fox for a little while now and I understand. I really do Last night at first, I was upset because this is hard.&#34; I admitted. &#34;I love our pups, but More twins maybe even triplets  4 or 5 pups sound like a lot..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m a fox shifterbut that isn&#39;t the part that makes me say that.. Twins run in my family too. My dad&#39;s a twin. Kaizen&#39;s a triplet Five pups, all only a little bit apart in age some weened and more nursing I got scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Every pup we have is a blessing Willow but I&#39;ve been thinking. The boys would do good at day care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But they can&#39;t raise them like we can!&#34; I said defensively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, but you deserve a fucking break too.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;If that bothers you *that* much. I Know dad&#39;s itching to watch them with Lustros and Zolotos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t think about that &#34;I I don&#39;t mind that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything for you little mate.&#34; He said truthfully. &#34;Anything. I had a whole trip planned for Below, just the two of us for a month, but this is better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way he said it yesterday made me think that the festival was the Only thing he wanted to do not spend time together not have a break from managing a pack, twins, and figuring out magic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d like that  but After their festival. I get what he was trying to do. He wanted to spend time with me, but if he wanted that, he didn&#39;t have to spend a fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bet you paid in blood for this.&#34; I mumbled. He nodded. &#34;Lady Moon Kaizen.&#34; I kissed him gently from across the table. For some reason it reminded me of the day we completed the bond Since that moment every touch, kiss, and hug feel almost new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re my mate Whatever you want, even a wish I&#39;ll grant it.&#34; He smiled softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only have the one wish Kaizen, but it&#39;s stupid.&#34; I looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know what they said and if I ask he&#39;ll do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I think it he&#39;ll try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m listening.&#34; He encouraged. &#34;I already know but words hold power. You must speak your wish not just hold it in your heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t. Bryson already kind of granted it.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you can&#39;t wish for the same thing twice, so I assume you want the boys to see them.&#34; He said with a soft smile. I could feel his warmth. &#34;I could take them. Arviel would let mebut what of their lives?&#34; He asked this honestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t do that to them.&#34; I looked down. &#34;It would be easy to do it but it&#39;s also abhorrently selfish. They could be here with the sibling I never met in an instantThey could be turned if anyone has an issue too but what of their lives?&#34; I asked more myself than anything. &#34;But if I had to wish for anything. It would be that we find a way to make it work.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can do that but it won&#39;t be for a while..&#34; He said pressing his forehead to mine, but his stomach also growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What would happen if I wished we had food?&#34; I asked as a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It would appear, but the chefs would be tired.&#34; He smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For us, all Kaizen had to do was raise his hand ever so slightly, and they bowed as they served us It&#39;s times like this, that I&#39;m reminded that he&#39;s a Prince of Shifters, not just an Alpha.</p>
