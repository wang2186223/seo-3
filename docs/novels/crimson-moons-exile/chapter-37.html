                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at how dark it was tonight there weren&#39;t any stars out there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The arena is ready when you are.&#34; Said Tyson. He sounded as tired as I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m ready now.&#34; I said hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trip. All 28 hours was done. And without incident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of being fatigued, I was amped. Not happily so, but I had to close my eyes a second. I took a few breaths.  I felt like all I had to do was reach out, and I would grasp my power Something new something I shouldn&#39;t touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ok?&#34; Asked Willow, worried for me. She hadn&#39;t said anything the whole trip about all this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, but get off the next exit.&#34; I said shaking my head. I had a fucking headache. My chest pounded like a drum as she drove I felt alive</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Want to talk about it?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want his throat in my teeth.&#34; I grumbled. &#34;For your sake.&#34; I said silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was quite a while as well, not really sure what to do with the information I gave her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m safe. I&#39;m sure when we get there since you said you were ready, that they will be prepared.&#34; She said putting her hand on my leg as she drove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you and also thank you for driving. I feel half crazed.&#34; I said with a humorless laugh.  She was in danger. I was a fucking idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I should have let him be assassinated. Maybe I should have let the wool be over Tyson&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s terrible. I still feel like all this is my fault.&#34; She said silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow even if you weren&#39;t my mate, even if I met you the Right way all it would take is some trigger like you being hurt to make me mindless. Any threat to you I cannot allow. Any harm meant for you I will take.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kissed her hand. She blushed like a ginger-topped tomato</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed we were being trailed after that. A detail of 6 SUV&#39;s followed, while my mate looked nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even now, we are being told we are not welcome those who Are loyal to the crown see me as a traitor and a dog that needs to be put down.&#34; I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well all of them are stupid.&#34; She said bitterly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I massaged her neck while she drove She felt so tense... She felt like a Warrior before patrol,  It was as if her very instincts knew that we were headed to danger. We got closer in silence, and she held my hand with all her might.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow began to panic. She drove like a Warrior, and this was her ATV, but it wasn&#39;t good that I let her stay in that state. She drove with one hand, but her knuckles were white. She thought of Misfit, she worried for them, for Ace, Gilbert, and Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s going to be alright.&#34; I said to console her. It seemed my touch on her mark was what she needed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know&#34; She mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When we get there, I&#39;m sure since so many shifters are following us, that we&#39;re going to be immediately incarcerated. I also assume that we won&#39;t have a lawyer, nor are our trials like mortal trials. It&#39;s up to Tyson with whatever he rules should I lose. Should I win, he will lose a lot of face, and likely have trouble maintaining his position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because He won&#39;t be the strongest anymore.&#34; She said thinking out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chances are since we&#39;re equals, it&#39;ll be a mistake.&#34; I said directing her to that last turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The long thin 2-way street was lined with pines, and about midway down the strait path was a booth in the middle. Both lanes were blocked, and I rummaged around for my ID. We probably wouldn&#39;t need it, but when she slowed to a stop, the Warrior got out the booth to bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This Royal Guard was strong enough to be an Alpha of a small pack somewhere. To be honest, those who work for the royal family for the most part could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His majesty expects you, your highness.&#34; He said still bowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carry on.&#34; I said gruffly so he could rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw him get on his radio when he pushed the button for gates to lift</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still held my hand silently I felt terrible for putting her in this situation. Soon she&#39;ll be surrounded by nobles ones who for the most part didn&#39;t like or trust humans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This place looks really nice.&#34; She commented. &#34;The homes here are so flipping big.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wolves who can&#39;t shift live there. All the servants of the Royal House of Charred are Omegas, save the guards. Since their wolves are dormant, they can serve the crown without freaking out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They care for the grounds and the council&#39;s needs.. This was done a Long time ago, and no one knew quite why other than the fact that since they have no active wolf, being around us isn&#39;t as taxing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The multistoried brick castle had grand fountains and statues to show grandma&#39;s taste. She was the one who decorated. The uniforms the servants wore reflected that as well. I always liked the suits with gold trim. I also like the brownish redheaded wolf Mr. Julian. He was pale as paper, but stood proud, as if serving a vagabond was something to brag about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the head Omega, the one who took our bags when we got out, and bowed to us as if we were here on business pleasant business. We took about three steps into the lobby, before Shakira, the Hyena guard stopped us. She was behind us, while her mate stood in front. Jabari, the Iron Fanged, named so because he was born with metal teeth, was actually the more easy going of the two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were both dark skinned, being from Africa like grandmother, the original Wolf Queen She held her hair in a short bob, while her mate held long dreads. In their culture, women are 30% larger than their males. In their society, men often held traditionally female roles in their packs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are they doing to Ace, Gilbert, and Jack?&#34; Demanded Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My trio of requested wolves had already been placed in cuffs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about me.&#34; Chuckled Jack. &#34;Isn&#39;t that right Shakira?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Silence You.&#34; She hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The King himself couldn&#39;t catch me.&#34; He laughed as they took him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t piss them off.&#34; Growled Ace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I go in peace for my Alpha&#39;s sake&#34; Said Gilbert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re under are-&#34; Shakira was cut off by Mr. Julian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With all due respect Commander Shakira, I believe the young master requested trial by combat. In that event, he is to be treated As A Guest, until After the results.&#34; He said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not trust him so easily.&#34; She sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do.&#34; He countered. &#34;If I&#39;m correct, his majesty swore he would not fight our king unless his highness strikes the first blow. I&#39;ve never known a royal wolf to go back on their words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked offended that he would defend me, but I was moments away from losing my fucking mind. I shielded her, feeling my claws extend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s to be in the arena right now anyway.&#34; She snarled. &#34;Your highness, regardless of your treatment, we do need to take you both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put the cuffs in her pocket, while we walked down the hall. I wouldn&#39;t have allowed my claws to be restrained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Willow-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed the breakneck pace of the Warriors, who only got Kaizen&#39;s permission because he followed closely behind with Jack, Gilbert, and Ace already a corridor away I could hear them chatting ahead of us, speaking loudly probably so that we could hear that they were ok.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The long passages of this place were wide and grand It was as if it were made to accommodate people like Kaizen. The floors were black, but the gold accents and flags told me that that was his royal colors The crest was a wolf breathing fire, and they hung high all over. There were paintings and statues, seemingly of their grandfather who looked like them, but honestly, Kaizen reminded me more of the Adversary depictions than anything.</p>
