                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran with my wolves, who thought it funny that &#39;Willow&#39;s grandma&#39; couldn&#39;t cook I didn&#39;t mind being poked at a bit, because they didn&#39;t know. I think what she made might actually have killed a mortal. They don&#39;t go around exactly eating &#39;essence of suffering&#39; unless they have bland food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made myself chuckle at not only that, but also my wolves. This was meant to be serious, but I knew better. It was just a minotaur with a fancy colo-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Holy shit, he&#39;s the same size as Me on my hind legs.] I said halting to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was glittery and sparkly, covered in a thick layer of old blood on his white fur he smelled of bull and aggression. I doubt he had any kind of mind, but I tried anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted to speak English. I knew he wouldn&#39;t know wolf, and I didn&#39;t know half-beast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Surrender and have the protection of MisfitMoon, refuse and die by my lightning.&#34; I warned, letting it crackle across my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked surprised, as if he understood language for the first time,  then he fearfully looked at his hands, finally, he ran. His hooves left heavy prints in the soft earth, and some of my wolves ran after him, while others stayed with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well shit.&#34; I grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted again, linking my Warriors. /I want you guys to keep him away from the pack. Were are the Hunters?/ I asked, and one on my left spoke up. I had a total of 10 with me while Jack and Gilbert stayed home. I needed them there in case something happens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other creatures were ignorant, but more importantly, I knew my grandparents wouldn&#39;t aid me. They were here for the party, not to babysit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/It&#39;s headed right for them. / Linked one on my right, a stocky brown furred wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Then I want the rest of you to branch off. Cover me. Any who know how to use a firearm, be ready to snatch one. They&#39;re going to have not only silver, but likely silver swords too because they need to behead him to kill him. Bullets only piss them off./ I linked this while sniffing the familiar scent of the beast</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Yes sir!/ They all linked around the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t long before we heard gunshots, screams and roars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t just stand there, Shoot!&#34; Screamed their commander. He was a gruff older man, who wore a red beret and old military clothes the government changed the way uniforms looked some years ago, but if I had to guess, I&#39;d say his stuff was from the 1990&#39;s... and by the looks of it, a costume. The rest were in combat pants and green t-shirts. Some had regular sneakers</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t coordinated They behaved nothing like the militaristic mortal Hunter packs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lieutenant Danniel help!&#34; I could kind of make out that there were 10 of them, all firing every direction in the woods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Private Ryheem No!&#34; said I assume Lt. Daniel. Private Ryheem was tossed in the air, nearly landing at my feet. When I got there, I saw he had no legs. The minotaur took them clean off with a single swipe, and the man passed out. They were going to die out here Had they been in town, I almost wondered would Tamriel and Sentinel do anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then an idea formed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[I&#39;m going to save your friend.] I said cauterizing the wounds. They didn&#39;t understand, but they didn&#39;t shoot with me close to their living friend. [Take him to the infirmary.] I said seeing my wolves. Look more than shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Your highness. Why?] asked Warrior Hibbert, a stern gray furred, silver eyed wolf. I only knew who he was because of the badge he wore around his neck. I need to order more of those once we get the system up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Tamriel is stationed here to protect *mortals* I mean to keep maybe 4 or 5 in the cells. We&#39;ll sort out who lives later.] I said firmly, and they nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many of the humans only saw a glimpse of me since I was so fast, but when I came out the shadows proper, they freaked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Holy Shit! What the Hell is *That* ?!&#34; They all more or less screamed and started shooting at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted, letting the flame between my horns flicker. &#34;Mortals you trespass. I am Kaizen, Demigod of the Horned One.&#34; I said because I doubted they knew anything of my father, or details on my uncles  &#34;Begone.&#34; I spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them picked up a radio. He was the one who had military ranks on his shoulders. I&#39;d seen a few mortal movies here and there to know that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a teleport, I was in front of him They were all a little taller than Willow it took no effort to snap the arm that held his radio. I&#39;d kind of done it on accident, and I just held him in the air a bit by the throat. His body dangled while their aim was so terrible, I didn&#39;t have to really dodge. He clawed at me with dull human claws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You guys. Why are you even out here?&#34; I plopped him on the ground, and he ran back to his people. None of them were dead yet. And I didn&#39;t smell any supernatural blood. So they hadn&#39;t shot anybody</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like You&#39;d want to know.&#34; Said Lt. Daniel. &#34;Fire!&#34; He yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. Now that I had to get close, I did have to be careful. At point blank, I noticed that they didn&#39;t smell like Hunters nor did they really look battle hardened but honestly it didn&#39;t really matter. Under the moon they would die, and when they awoke, they would be on whatever layer they belonged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I teleported to each of them, taking their weapons out their grubby little paws. It was hard not to break their bones, but I did that to a few of them. I think about 4 out of the 10 were injured from me, and they ran to their trucks, but without long distance weapons, they were honestly no match. The tires got slashed by my wolves, and those who thought the tin can would save them were wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My Warriors weren&#39;t just standing there watching either. They made sure they didn&#39;t escape, and those who continued to track the minotaur howled his location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one as they were disarmed, they were taken away to the cells. They weren&#39;t Bad just like an incredibly small county jail We could have something more humane arranged later. I wouldn&#39;t destroy this solution. It was obvious they were humans that didn&#39;t know what they were doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last was their leader. He didn&#39;t have the scent of a Hunter, nor an X on his soul either</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perfect. No one could argue against helping the town with them in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next was the familiar beast. I became a streak of red lightning He wasn&#39;t that far but he had a club the size of a small tree. That caught my attention. I might have been fast, but the way he wielded it, and with how large it was, I know I&#39;d get genuinely hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted to speak English. It seemed more of my Warriors were here to help, and he was kind of surrounded in the light patch of an almost forest clearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Minotaur, I didn&#39;t come to kill you like the humans. They looked like a bunch of dumb hicks who saw you, and thought that they could catch or kill you. I mean to make you pack.&#34; I said firmly. &#34;On my blood and honor, if I defeat you in fair combat, do you agree to partake of my blood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, raising the makeshift club in a combative pose. He snorted, but I could tell it was half-beast. He didn&#39;t trust me enough to shift, and he attacked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He roared and I did as well. I barely dodged the mighty swing that shattered not only his weapon, but the tree it hit. Pine needles and splinters flew like rain in a thunderstorm, while I had to dodge those too. He wasn&#39;t like the mortals. He knew what he was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wildly clawed at me the instant his weapon was gone, and I dodged between his slash to give a half-strength headbutt. I just couldn&#39;t get good footing, but he knew that, and didn&#39;t let up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snapped, biting his arm, but he didn&#39;t flinch. The taste of testosterone and old, dried blood didn&#39;t make me stop either I could barely taste anything to be fair. He snorted steam, and bellowed a grumble I couldn&#39;t understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was probably shit talk, but it didn&#39;t matter</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He punched me hard enough that I impacted another tree, and it took the wind out my lungs. Compared to him, the humans were comedic relief He jumped high in the air and our horns met with a crash that took the wind out my lungs, but I did not buckle. This time we were both on all fours, while I was still dizzy and dazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew if I let up, he would kill me. The shockwave ran through the forest, and neither one of us lost ground. He was truly a formidable foe. I would respect this fight and I wouldn&#39;t use my powers. I could have essentially tasered him and forced him to drink, but it would not make him a loyal soldier it would make him a slave. I wanted my people to be free to choose free to request freedom. In death they will be my demons, and in life they serve the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I roared, smashing heads with him again, but my horns were made for ramming, while his were for goring. He tried angling his long white horns to try to get me, but he couldn&#39;t because I was nimbler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed my horns, being burned by the flame between them. He snarled, going back to what he thought was working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He growled backing up to run again, but this time I dodged to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Olay!&#34; Said one of my Warriors. They were confident that I&#39;d win, but I didn&#39;t let their banter distract me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[really?&#34;] I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jumped on the back of his neck, but it was too thick to scruff like a wolf. I had to dodge clawed hands while he snorted steam. I held on while he bucked and shook violently, unable to reach me. I shifted and dug my claws into his neck, getting his spine and he froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Submit or I will end you right here.&#34; I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel his head bow I let go, hopped off, and bit my wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated, but I saw his reddish eyes dilate It looked like he&#39;d never had meat before.</p>
