                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two years and six months passed, but I wasn&#39;t worried Time is different, and thankfully it meant that I was probably gone about two and a half hours back home.  Grandmother was still a little unsure about forgiving anyone, because she had every right to feel betrayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I learned a lesson while consoling her too. No matter what I must not let Willow see the true monster I am. I don&#39;t feel compassion anymore or sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If asked, I&#39;d kill without hesitation so long as it wasn&#39;t a loved one. It was just business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen you&#39;re head&#39;s in the clouds.&#34; Said the Moon Goddess I hadn&#39;t seen the Wolf King, nor Queen. I think they were clear across the other side of the realm They also likely felt guilty, and didn&#39;t want to come see me, nor my siblings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I&#39;m thinking about home.&#34; I said sitting down with her in front of the lake She wasn&#39;t tarnished anymore, but she wasn&#39;t her bright, happy self either I won&#39;t let her leave here without being ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her greatest fears are the dark imprisonment and the pain of dying Those are natural for anyone. Needless to say, that her own son and mate did it was just the icing on the cake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think then that I&#39;ll return.&#34; She said looking me in the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re not ready, I won&#39;t make you.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will never be *ready* to see your grandfather like that again so instead, I&#39;ll go. Your deal regards the little ones he will make I have no right to impede that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You make it sound as if I was right to try and stop him.&#34; I said wondering what had her so upset about him making my sons</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know my mate He makes Warriors not children&#34; She said sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yet, as a Sanctuary, Urth is Safe from that kind of strife.&#34; I put my hand on her shoulder The werewolves who were here no longer hated me, but because I was marked, I would always be a bit of an outcast here</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yet I still feel as though I am not needed, nor wanted.&#34; She admitted, being handed tea by one of her people. &#34;I know I am but you saw. He was so engrossed with retaliation, that his anger made him imprison me His powers are dark and cold There is no feeling to it I would have died alone in that bubble had my own son cleaved the world in half&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she saw too Xaxas&#39;s blade was a literal part of him, just as my bow is mine But the difference is in strength. I could do some damage sure, not that I&#39;d want to, but he destroys entire realms She had no souls there but those moon goddesses were dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It left every soul ever made there to be judged by the Lords of Light and Night all the destroyed afterlives too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandmother, you don&#39;t have a weapon do you?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She summoned a small, metal lantern It held blue light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Humblon gave this to me when I was still young It was one of the first or second nights I was completely ignored by Arviel I didn&#39;t even know my powers would have a cycle back then. It grew colder, longer, and scarier with each night. I didn&#39;t know your grandfather then Arviel made me no weapons That was never my purpose. You forget I was always made to be Just a wife to Humblon, not the mate of Zuviel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The auditory whoosh was for our sake, since Xaxas actually didn&#39;t make sound when he used his ability</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother-&#34; he was cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Begone!] Shouted Grindel, appearing from nowhere. Even though the Moon Goddess was lesser, Grindel&#39;s task was to guard the In-between, the endless realm of the spirit world, that led to all afterlives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grindel would be strong enough to kick him out, because universally, all gods thought he should be able to do his job, and repel all but the Lords of Light and Night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No let him speak.&#34; She said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked hurt seeing her slightly tarnished If he&#39;d seen how bad it was when I got here, I don&#39;t think he could have handled it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t ask your forgiveness but I do kneel to apologize.&#34; He drew his sword, and kneeled before his mother on bended knee. &#34;You are fragile as a butterfly, yet I put you in harms way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got up, and hugged his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not lower yourself to me Xaxashevaal You are a man now. What little time I had with you, was all I would have ever gotten All I would have been given. Do you even rightly see me as your mother?&#34; She asked honestly...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of Course I do.&#34; He said standing. He stood there, looking down on her since his true form was so much bigger, but not as big as the Horned One. &#34;That you call me my full name it saddens me mother.&#34; He said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That I was made a disposable pawn in the games of powerful men has saddened me.&#34; She quietly countered. &#34;Take us Below.&#34; She request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; He said snapping his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell felt. Dangerous right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mood was sour, and the suffering of the damned was so great, that the scent of it, and the sound of their screams could be faintly heard on the wind</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did not approach grandmother. He was waiting for her to come to him. He said nothing, likely for fear of scaring her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My lord.&#34; She said hesitating</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had to sting Again, he said nothing. The Void King bowed to his moon goddess and she ran, hugging his neck. They were mates. You could literally see the thin red line between them, but he was probably afraid she would break this bond That she would leave him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me little butterfly I ask so much, but I am greedy.&#34; He said kissing her on the top of the head. &#34;I have no right to do anything other than apologize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I accept, but you reminded me too much of Arviel, husband. I know Lia feels expendable as well.&#34; His hurt became true guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are invaluable. Even now Kaizen may ask Whatever he wishes, even my crown if it means I may be with you.&#34; He said it with conviction He really would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He actually took it off and put it in my hands. It floated there, and just kind of sat there levitating, spinning above my open palms. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to lift this I think as a mortal, if I touched it, it would destroy me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unlimited power of his crown was only a fraction of what he could do Even Xaxas took a few steps back. All hell was silent. No one knew what I would do or say or wish for or put it on</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted none of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not want such a responsibility.&#34; I said firmly. &#34;I wish my sons and nephews be true demigods as I am, and we three gain the strength of our titles. I don&#39;t wish godhood. I don&#39;t want grand powers like that You bless me enough. I did this for my unborn, and my siblings. I want our little ones to have the immortality I have. I want them to have happy, prosperous lives I will not ask anything of you grandmother if you don&#39;t wish them to have mates, that is your choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I will grant them this. Mates keep the peace Without it my mate.&#34; She couldn&#39;t finish, and he held her in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I will give you three powers that match your numbers. I know you ask that because of Uriel You will be Equal to him now, and there will be Many who Will Not Like This.&#34; Said The Horned One.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know but should Uriel be ordered to slay my babies in their crib he Will He has a master, just as I do.&#34; I bowed my head and raised his crown high. I wished he&#39;d take it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just holding it made my heart beat too fast I was outside but everything and everyone was too close. And I knew too much all at once, all the time I knew how many souls were on every layer... and I knew the secrets to how old the Kings really were</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That our world we resided on had been essentially reset to save Lia&#39;s life multiple times, and so too were the memories of the Champions to cope with their long lives</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other siblings were summoned, and they were confused. They didn&#39;t know of grandmother&#39;s tarnished skin either, until now. They were shocked to see me holding grandfather&#39;s crown, so they both put two and two together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen You made a wish.&#34; Said Tyson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye but not a bad one.&#34; I said feeling myself summon my bow It was kind of automatic. It was about as long as I was tall now and it was no longer wooden looking. It was a black iron longbow, made with an edge to the front of it, so I could use it as a sword The glowing red runes held my name, rank, and title As did my sibling&#39;s weapons</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With my power, your titles will befit you With my mercy, I will not give you mortal sons They will be demigods as you are, for I offered all Hell to my grandson, and he merely wishes protection for his family.&#34; Said grandfather. &#34;I will even add the knowledge you need to restrain yourselves, that you don&#39;t kill your mates on accident.&#34; He smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit!&#34; I said at the realization that there was a major loophole in my wish there were probably others too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clapped his hands and I was home in bed. I gasped awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t look at the time, it didn&#39;t matter. I ran downstairs, passing by wolves who kneeled at the sight of me, making way so I didn&#39;t bump into them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I needed to find my mate, and tell her the good news. I did this so she could be happy I didn&#39;t think it right she cry for our children before even their souls were made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck I was blessed.</p>
