                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few months passed and it seemed the boys went from maybe 2 pounds each to 40.  Kaizen told me that he didn&#39;t get his form until he was a teenager, but I had a Sneaking Suspicion that the Horned One was going to give them forms early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all he said *five* but didn&#39;t define if it was the *equivalent* to five or five *actual* years that followed the Sun not Hell or whatever</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harmony warned me about the words of gods, but if they really did become big boys, that would be fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boys seemed to have a growth spirt. While Harmony was pregnant, they went from tiny to border collie sized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Horned One said they&#39;ll get their mortal forms at five but he didn&#39;t specify between five years, or the Equivalent to five but I don&#39;t mind. That they&#39;re mentally older, and might get their forms soon makes me happy. Harmony was 5 months along, and my pups they looked about ready to get a human shape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It also means that they can play with the other kids their size and I don&#39;t feel so standoffish about sending them to daycare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t have hands, so Kaizen helped get them ready. I could hear him sing in there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Splish splash! Na-na-na na&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yay!&#34; Beamed Ari I started recording. I wanted to catch this without him noticing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari was done and on a towel, bouncing to the song, while Vex was miserable, still hating water. Magic held the blow dryer. That&#39;s cheating!... also I never thought to do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Splish-Splash and you&#39;re all clean!&#34; He chuckled. &#34;Vexi boy, stop being mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Complained Vex. &#34;I don&#39;t wanna be clean!&#34; He barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop trying to run!&#34; he laughed, scrubbing our lil dirty boy who likes to dig in the mud!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mama!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gods.&#34; Kaizen rolled his eyes. &#34;It&#39;s Just water. You&#39;re Fine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MAMA!&#34; Vex&#39;s complaint was loud, and unanswered. If I come now, he&#39;ll never learn that baths are GOOD and needed! &#34;Mama save me! I don&#39;t wanna be clean! I wanna stay in the mud!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you *really* want to keep playing outside?&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;YEAH!&#34; They both beamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you wanted to go to the treat I had planned *but* the mud&#39;s more fun.&#34; He smiled softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Treat?&#34; They both asked at the same time. I was going to come in, but I trusted my mate...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.I have an idea and Willow&#39;s gonna kill me...&#34; He sang, looking at the ceiling. &#34;.A bath for grandpa&#39;s house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was right I Am gonna kill him! They were supposed to take a bath and go to day care today!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My son stood in the ankle high water for him The two debated, but grandpa&#39;s house, any one of them, meant playtime, not sitting in a classroom. And I don&#39;t know a puppy out there who doesn&#39;t want to play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.ok.&#34; Vex huffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow, I got the pups! Your trainer&#39;s here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sweet!&#34; I yelled behind him. I didn&#39;t teleport or anything; he just wasn&#39;t paying attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AH!&#34; He yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;EE! I Got You!&#34; I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a knock at the front door, and sure enough, the kitsune couple was here. They were proudly in their fox forms, but it wasn&#39;t one I would be able to have. I run on 4 legs like a normal fox, but I was told that because of my horns, I should be able to cast fox magic while shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I would very much like to not have another incident Shifting in the castle was embarrassing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in!&#34; I said summoning my textbook Fox Tricks, Licks, and Sticks. The name was weird, but it was catchy. So far this, and some basic forcefield stuff was all I&#39;d gotten my hands on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No no, remember, today&#39;s test day!&#34; beamed Mr. Red. His real name actually means a specific shade of red in autumn, but with his real name comes apparently a reputation in the supernatural community.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were slow and methodical with my training. No shortcuts. Just old fashioned repetition, testing, and lectures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There are no fill in the blanks, nor worksheets either Each question must be answered in writing, using the correct key word. If I&#39;m right, but leave out the terms or vocabulary I get NO credit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Absolute Bullshit but they take this as seriously as they take their restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\-----Kaizen----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let her think she got me. She still thinks Way too loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now it sounds like a distorted radio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;ll help her confidence when she does her teleportation test. She doesn&#39;t know, but I&#39;ll see her here later today, and I&#39;m supposed to give her a mortal item that smells of her parents to prove that she completed her task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had the kids. They were going to see their human grandparents today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why not?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By scent, and instinct, I could tell that this is likely the last week they will be pup-shaped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t spoken with the Horned One, but I know he does this for their sake. I think? Talking wolves and being overloaded with our existence is probably a bit much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked on the closet. Her mother knocked back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;DAD! DAD! CAN I TAKE MY SQUISHY?&#34; beamed Ari Mr. Clarence gave my boys a teddy bear each. They were octopi; Ari&#39;s was the green one, and Vex&#39;s was the yellow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They loved them, and were careful not to destroy them too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck if I was a pup, those things would be *gone.* I was such a rotten lil bastard. Heh. There was nothing we didn&#39;t get into, half not knowing any better, half knowing that whatever it was would be fun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34; I said shaking my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AHHHH!!!!!&#34; yelled Vex, spinning, about to chase that tail. He already had his squishy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks dad!&#34; Beemed Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No problem boys. Let&#39;s go.&#34; I said shaking my head, heading downstairs to see my mate taking a test. She looked focused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would leave her alone, but for encouragement, I kissed her on the cheek. They ran down the stairs as fast as they could with those toys, and a small part of me already missed them being small. But this is for the best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good job mama.&#34; Said Ari, getting pet on the head. My boys are good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m getting flack in hell for not having them kill anything, eat souls, or roast humans already. I will teach them combat, but by their own morals they&#39;ll *choose* as I did to eat man&#39;s meat or not to do the work or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As generals, they can for the most part work Below in the castle. They don&#39;t *have* to fight since there is no war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. They don&#39;t *have* to be killers. I&#39;ll train them when they&#39;re ready, and not a day sooner... If they choose to take life, it will be their choice to help. For now, let them be fucking children. Me and Slah-hesh&#39;Rraa really got into it over this. So much so that the Pit sent a message from grandfather to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked on the closet three times again, and they knocked back; this time it was her father. With the coast clear, we hopped through, and her mom was with her baby girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry Willow didn&#39;t come this time. Her trainer&#39;s training her how to use fox magic.&#34; I said putting the updated care bag on the table. They didn&#39;t need bottles or baby supplies anymore, but more importantly, they were a little bigger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hate being out the territory with our pups, but I&#39;m *the* biggest thing this side of the state Nothing will harm my sons, and with Xaxas&#39;s protection, none will harm the humans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Granma!&#34; beamed Vex, being respectful and *not* jumping on her. He did jump on their couch, and pressed his nose to his aunt. &#34;She smells like mama.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well 1Angelica *is* your auntie.&#34; Smiled Willow&#39;s mother. &#34;Want to hear about your mama?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do! I do!&#34; they barked at the same time; it made little Willow giggle. Angelica scents like her sister before she became a fox.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All in this house are to remain mortal. I was going to give her a blessing, but father forbade it. Arviel wants this line left alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really does smell like Willow too But we must respect the Light&#39;s wishes. Had the Horned One approved it, I&#39;d have blessed her with health or something, nothing special. She looked healthy, and smiled reaching for Vex. I&#39;ll leave well enough alone. I went to speak with her father while they excitedly laid their heads on their grandma&#39;s lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They learned about how much of a shy kid she was. She was a good kid who didn&#39;t rock the boat, always well mannered and always with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took this time to speak in the backyard with her father. So long as we don&#39;t leave the yard, we&#39;re good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see the horns and fire, and it still doesn&#39;t feel real.&#34; He mumbled, handing me a glass of lemonade. &#34;Sorry, do you drink juice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do.&#34; I said leaving out that it&#39;s usually when I&#39;m doing Tarteron Shots but *he* doesn&#39;t have to know that. I saw the broken swing set back here. &#34;Did my mate use that?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was born like our boys but I was a teenager when I got flesh Like I know what they are, they&#39;re at our pack park and stuff, but I didn&#39;t get to use that growing up&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I sensed my mate&#39;s approach.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah.&#34; I said rolling my eyes, but her father really did scream. It made my mouth water</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Shit.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can fly; stop being a *baby.*&#34; beamed Willow to the left of me. She thought the fear was for her but really it was because I see even her father as a walking hamburger when hungry</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t help it! I hadn&#39;t eaten yet!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry dad this was my homework and I passed.&#34; She smiled. Can I get a paper towel that smells like home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snapped my fingers and fixed her playset. I also summoned the paper towels. Her dad put his scent on it, by wiping his hands on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks dad.&#34; She hugged him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anytime. Go learn magic.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s coming along nicely as well.&#34; I commented, hearing my pups have zoomies, zipping past us now that the story was over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know anything about it, but for her, I&#39;ll support her.&#34; He said looking at our sons. &#34;She really is Night Marked&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In our case, it isn&#39;t a bad thing.&#34; I said as he nodded. &#34;She&#39;s not taken life, nor do I think she&#39;d ever want to. She&#39;s still the same person just my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never seen her so happy either Kaizen.&#34; He said getting a stick, and tossing it for the boys to playfight over. &#34;She damn near glows.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I try to keep her happy. My moon rises and sets with  her&#34; I mumbled. &#34;Sometimes that&#39;s hard since I have no human part of me like other werewolves I&#39;m all monster mated to a formally human.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may be a monster, but you&#39;re also a good man.&#34; Said her father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only he knew how many thousands of people I&#39;d killed, and how I didn&#39;t give a single fuck.</p>
