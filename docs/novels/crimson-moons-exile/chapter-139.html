                <p>A/N: If anyone wants a stray kitten, Hobo Jr. is free lol. She&#39;s so cute. I think it&#39;s a girl but she won&#39;t let me get close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back home  Jerold waited for me in different clothes? He wore a robe like the pantheon does.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holy shit The &#39;missing&#39; Lord of Aggression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re quick as a whip. You must know my son.&#34; He said sounding *exactly* like Jerold. He was a little taller... and hair the slightest bit darker brown. But that was Jerold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck he even *smelled* like Jerold. Moreso than even a twin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I call that old bull uncle. Is it possible to stay for a while?&#39; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mortal son does not know me I miss my mate, but I know she is safe so long as I stay away.. It is likely better that way. Come take your payment that I may begone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well fuck me then.&#34; He grunted. I heard right before I face planted into the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great. You won&#39;t leave me alone.&#34; Said Xaxas a man I *did not* want to see right now &#34;What do you want now? Stop singing Baby Cat in your head.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran into Jerold&#39;s office. I could see Xaxas&#39;s door open on it&#39;s own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Private!&#34; I yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your dick will work if you use it! You can talk to your uncle you know&#34; Xaxas shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;THAT&#39;S NOT-SHUT UP!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come see.&#34; He said pulling out his phone. His office friends went into his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow it&#39;s as big as mine.&#34; Said a centaur</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah, it&#39;s the girth the ladies like.&#34; Said another Centaur. &#34;Did you make that impressive foot long sub?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another one sung the &#39;$5 foot long&#39; sub song from Way-sub.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Great.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas chuckled. &#34;No, but it was my suggestion. You&#39;re welcome. This is what you get for *ignoring* me! I need attention!&#34; He sang. &#34;Baby photos are next!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I want to see those.&#34; Said another officer. No wait, that was the chief!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shouldn&#39;t y&#39;all be Working?!&#34; I shouted; my accent came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re on Break!&#34; Yelled the Unicorn Chief going into Xaxas&#39;s office to see too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*AND* his mate&#39;s a turned human. Woo.&#34; Another chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s giving my mate a run for his money. Watch out Jerold.&#34; Giggled Noah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rawr.&#34; Said a cat shifter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Laughter made me feel two feet tall...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods. Damn. IT.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>AND NOW THEY KNEW TOOO</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; Said Jerold. &#34;GET BACK TO WORK YOU HERD OF CALVES!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come with me.&#34; I said still mentally singing that annoying ass children&#39;s song.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It must be important.&#34; Jerold whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s important/&#34; Asked Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Baby Cat do-do, dad do-do-do</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We teleported.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s your mother?&#34; Asked Torros, the Great Bull. Jerold&#39;s father. He disobeyed the Horned One and disappeared</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was never meant to love that human woman, a former priestess for the Light Court but the mark on his neck told me that their love was real. That Grandmother Did This</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck if this gets out, I don&#39;t know what will happen to Torros since he&#39;s a Herald, but I hope grandfather understands why I&#39;ve done this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She adopts orphans. Where were you?&#34; Said Jerold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Being a coward.&#34; He said looking away from his son. &#34;I I have more blood than you. Alavastros is here as well I believe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did not know he existed. I always wanted a child to show what a father is, yet for all but my own blood, that was denied.&#34; Said Jerold somberly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.I as wellmy former master&#39;s ire was so great Humblon saved me I was sentenced to die, yet Mercy gave mercy Now I serve the Light Court Now I am in deeper water than even throwing me into the Pit would satisfy. His rage will destroy all Humblon loves, yet he risked that for *my* sake&#34; He said this with shame. &#34;And I could not come down here and tell you Even now, this boy covers for me Here&#39;s your payment.&#34; He tried giving me the scroll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;t take it. It was the favor of the brother of the Half King and a wish but I needed nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I take that, you have no more business here.&#34; I said with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would you do this General Kaizen?&#34; He asked bowing his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The mortal is your mate, your son and grandson suffered because of my grandfather&#39;s anger Anger that I fear as well. He plays nice because he has his way.&#34; I said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t stupid I knew the stories I saw how little they all care for individual life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Zuviel gets his hands on Torros, he&#39;s throwing him in the pit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched them both stand there and stare at each other. I left them to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside Eternya had his phone out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The master wants to know what&#39;s got you so worked up.&#34; He said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell him that I handled it; and you go to the basement. You are to stay there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know about Torros.&#34; Said Eternya. My eyes see through these thin mortal walls. Had your house been stone, this would not be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The curtains were also a sheer white all in the now empty living room already saw too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear their links and whispers, being nosy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not to tell Xaxas.&#34; I hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eternya stood there. &#34;. I have already lost favor with my father, my master, and the Horned One, Lord Kaizen. My children angered Arviel. What am I to do when this gets out? I have to think of Elinore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were both silent my pups found their way to my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Papa.] Said Ari wagging his little tail I had to think of them too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;re only well because of a wish One of them would have been mortal with mortal ailments and died young If not for grandfather, I would have had to bury whichever son he&#39;d have made age...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the fuck should I do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt Willow&#39;s hug. I looked down and she cried on my chest. &#34;I heard the story Look at them; they&#39;re all so happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I petted her head. &#34;I&#39;ll handle this. I don&#39;t know how, but I will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t get grandmother involved She likely paired them to try and stop the war and made things worse</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So much worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them stood in a circle, speaking in half-beast. Alavastros was so happy he had more family yet still wished his mother accepted him. That will be something he always yearns for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do I do?&#34; I mumbled. &#34;If I accept my payment, he will leave but we both know and all the Peeping Nosy LITTLE LISTENING SHITS KNOW TOO! You&#39;re Not Slick!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then one of them will tattle with their thoughts the moment a master arrives. I suggest Lord Bryson He&#39;s a father He will understand as I do Master Xaxas He will be irate.&#34; Said Eternya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s worked with Xaxas since before the war. I trust his judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I texted father, and he was here in about 10 seconds he landed inside the couch though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well fuck. I&#39;ll pay for that.&#34; He said having to rip it apart to be freed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Grawnpa GrawnPa!] They both shouted at the same time, running to dad. He picked them up and fuck they were so cuteMy little ammo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do realize I hear you son?&#34; Said dad shaking his head. &#34;So that&#39;s Torros; when I heard it from father, he called him Turrus.&#34; He emphasized the &#39;u&#39; sounds. &#34;Father wants his hide as a floor rug.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s Humblon&#39;s Herald.&#34; I blurted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah and you can&#39;t shoot the messenger. They have immunity. Let&#39;s go to Tarteron. You didn&#39;t do a bad thing son, but he&#39;s going to be pissed you tried hiding this at first.&#34; Father handed the boys to Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if not for his powers kind of dragging me and Eternya with him I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have gone What was this feeling</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxiety</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing grandfather passive scared me like a pup. I understood my smallness. We are his playthings, and this is his sand pit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Interesting train of thought. Eternya. You are here.&#34; He said with a slight glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eternya kneeled. He was unable to speak, not unwilling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Birrai&#39;shivaal. What brings you lot here?&#34; He said with growing anger with every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Turrus is the Herald of Humblon.&#34; Said father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Humblon sent him to give me a wish for saving his favorite planet.&#34; I said being forced to confess  &#34;At first he slipped up, and I didn&#39;t know, but he is the spitting image, even scent of the Battle Bull and Like the Battle Bull he is marked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandfather sat there for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Apythmenos.&#34; He said silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Release me from being your Herald and give it to Noirnamu. He didn&#39;t know.&#34; He vowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And make the Pit Mortal?&#34; He boomed. &#34;Are you out of your mind?! Why did you not tell me?!&#34; The second boom hurt my ears. It&#39;s one you felt in your chest..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I have worked with you since the beginning! You&#39;re just as spoiled as Arviel. The moment something doesn&#39;t go your way, you send me to clean up the carnage! And Torris was my friend! I won&#39;t kill my husband&#39;s older brother!&#34; He shouted glaring him in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Horned One stood. &#34;You go too far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You kill too much.&#34; Said the Herald standing. &#34;I am the only one in this room that will tell you &#39;no&#39;. As your Herald, I am the Only one able to. Look at your children, and your children&#39;s servant. Be careful who you banish Zuviel&#39;dek Noctun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You little Shit.&#34; Grandfather hissed. He marched past us, and all his anger was focused on the unyielding Bottomless Pit given form. He grew to be nearly twice his height.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no bow. There was no kneel. He stood there defiantly as if that was his equal, being only as tall as grandfather&#39;s belly button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A *right* little shit. Let them be sire. The only thing Torris did in all honesty was fuck his mate, something you do every 5 seconds now that you have your claws on her.&#34; Apythmenos grinned. &#34;Are you working on your fourth son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Horned One put his hand to his forehead. &#34;Fuck you. Like you don&#39;t wear out Noirnamu.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck you too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re Dick Sucking Height. Fuck You First.&#34; The Horned One growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well whip it out. I don&#39;t mind being a bottom.&#34; Apythmenos countered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was surprise, then laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop making me smile, you little shit.&#34; Grandfather hissed as we snickered as quietly as we could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? I&#39;m right and you know it. Give the goddess a break and fill the Bottomless One.&#34; He bowed sarcastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out. All of you. And You, you pervert, I&#39;m docking your pay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, No? Master please!&#34; he ran and held his hand. He was so small that he only held about 2 of his fingers. &#34;If I make any less, the imps will make more.&#34; He whined like a little kid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, *now* I&#39;m your master. What happened to Zuviel?&#34; He said walking away, still laughing. &#34;I won&#39;t pardon Turrus, but I won&#39;t punish him, nor Humblon He&#39;s a good judge of character For him to risk my wrath *During* the war *behind his brother&#39;s back*, Turrus deserves mercy, but I am too petty to give it. Begone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll tell Lady Lulli-&#34; Apythmenos was cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had the Pit been in the wrong, he wouldn&#39;t be able to pull that card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s pardoned!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was teleported into oncoming traffic! I dodged my mate&#39;s driving by a heartbeat!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SORRY!&#34; She screamed. &#34;I was taking them to the park!&#34; Willow swerved to pull over, and I rushed to make sure the boys were ok.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Wee!] Giggled the boys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did I do?!</p>
