                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was 8:30am, and I had the first appointment of the day. Although thankfully, it was over The lights in the office flickered, but I looked at the little images of my sons. They weren&#39;t blobs anymore, and this was starting to get a little surreal</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had defined features, but they still weren&#39;t ready. If they were born right now, they&#39;d be really premature, but alive So at least the most harrowing part of this pregnancy was kind of over</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was three months and two weeks along, and now not only did I show, but I couldn&#39;t fit most of my clothes The human equivalent was 5 months, and I&#39;d just gotten back from Dr. Sampson. He flew out here for us, Grace, AND Samira.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please stay for dinner.&#34; I offered before we left out the exit. He was leaving too, as he only came for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t impose.&#34; He said shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;ll be my treat.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mate offers good food She can cook.&#34; Said Kaizen standing next to me. He was needed at the security office, but he made everything wait for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be there at 6.&#34; He relented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! I won&#39;t tell you what I&#39;m making. It&#39;ll be a surprise.&#34; It really would be, since now I had no idea what I wanted to do!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. &#34;All the better. Living so long can be boring when you know your predictions are accurate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We shook wrists, but I swear his touch was really familiar. And ominous. He must have been a fae who aligns with the Horned One. He reminded me so much of him now that I thought about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go to the grocery store.&#34; Offered my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nursery was made, and we&#39;d figured out what baby materials we&#39;d need if they were born only the wolf. or kitsune. Gods they would be CUTE as little beans. But also more helpless than a human child if that was even possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen happily held my hand and put me in the car first, like a gentleman. I put on my seatbelt. He went past the store.And we drove outside of town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, if we head out now, we can stop by the store and get those nipples you were talking about, stop by some kind of human baby supply store and get your pump, and the grocery store there has more human vegetables and meat variety.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good plan but how are you going to hide yourself?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have an illusion already up. So long as I&#39;m not directly touching someone, they see a 6 foot tall, black haired mortal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, but I wanted to ask I would later, likely after dinner. Lately, the bed was also cold at times I thought I was imagining it, but I think he was going somewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pet store had a supernatural section and we got what we needed from there without any hassle. That side of the store was run by werewolves, who not only recognized Kaizen, but had a hard time ringing us up, because they wanted to show their appreciation We got $200 in teething supplies too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grocery store and specialty store were alright. I got about 30 pounds of salmon for variety, 10 pounds of asparagus, 35 whole corn, chickpeas for homemade humas, pita bread, and lemons. I knew how to make cake from scratch, but to get it started, I texted Flora for the cake. I thought I&#39;d mix it up a bit I didn&#39;t ask what he liked, and I KNEW everyone would want a taste, so I made extra. She texted back saying she&#39;d also make layered biscuits .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I texted Rick to get the grill going, so it would be hot and oiled when we got home. Apple wood grilled salmon with lemon, humas, asparagus, corn on the cob and grilled garlic should be a good thank you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he loaded the last of our things, the car was full. &#34;That&#39;ll do it.&#34; He smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is going to be fun.&#34; I said already in the car. He offered to load everything, not wanting me to pick up some of the heavy things we&#39;d bought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was about 3pm when we got home too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The packhouse was already booming with all the Warriors who lived there, as well as the Omegas helping however they could. Even though it wasn&#39;t a party, everyone pitched in so there was food already being made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. Everyone&#39;s got a job. Let&#39;s get this done.&#34; Said Kaizen when he pulled in. As soon as the car stopped, there were many hands to help unpack and start cleaning the meat and washing the vegetables</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went inside, with Flora, while Kaizen spoke with Gilbert and Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were multiple grills going, and we started with the veggies. Beef and pork were already roasted by Rick, who&#39;d done that on his own, while we brought fish I hope I got enough. I didn&#39;t think everyone would pitch in like this, but I wanted to make sure the Horned One was stuffed full before he went home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Horned One?&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#39; said Flora. &#34;Father be gentler, or you&#39;ll break the table.&#34; She chastised Even Eternya helped with kneading the dough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, just a weird gut feeling.&#34; I said helping with the seasoning of the meat before it was put outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had this all planned out. The garlic would be roasted in the smoke until it was soft, then I&#39;d put it in the food and on the salmon, beef, and anything else that it would pair nicely with. Rick would watch the grills, while I manned the kitchen inside. I sautéed the vegetables.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A feast was made for Dr. Sampson, and I led like a head chef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Dr. appeared with a soundless teleport, and he ended up in the center of the living room. He had his wife with him, and she looked adorable. Her dress was white, as was her hair. Her silver eyes reminded me of someone, but I couldn&#39;t figure out who.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I brought my wife Mrs. Sampson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome!&#34; I said running to hold each of one of their hands. &#34;Come, eat with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They sat, while me and Kaizen were also served. All kinds of dishes were put on the table, and the Void King asked for a bit of everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There that was again. He reminded me so much of the Horned One, that I had to be mistaking him for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So how long have you practiced&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A long time.&#34; He said cryptically. &#34;It staves off boredom, but with *you*, I hold personal interest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How so?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,&#34; He cut into the fish first, and hummed when he bit into it. &#34;For starters, you&#39;re my grandson&#39;s wife. Shit.&#34; He snapped his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Knew IT!&#34; I grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone froze as if time itself was stopped. Except his wife, the Moon Goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you figured it out hmm?&#34; He interlaced his fingers. &#34;You&#39;re only one of a Very small amount of mortals that have seen through this getup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what to say. He looked pissed, like I ruined his fun, but sounded pleased as if it was an amusing surprise that I figured it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Husband stop teasing the poor girl.&#34; Said the Moon Goddess, defending me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; He complained. &#34;Would you like to remain knowing, or ignorant? Either way I&#39;ll enjoy myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. I don&#39;t know. I assume since everyone is frozen, I&#39;ll sound really dumb if I slip up but won&#39;t I just find out again?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not impossible.&#34; He said cutting into the last morsel of salmon on his plate. &#34;I like the fish most. Nobody ever offers me fish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to know everyone keeps everything else from me as it is.&#34; I complained. &#34;And that&#39;s only the halibut.&#34; I smiled, making a dad joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; He grinned wide enough that I could see his teeth They all looked sharp He had no molars that I could see anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34; I said being cheeky. So they all liked dad jokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time will be restarted, and you, by your own merit, have my favor.&#34; He said shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Said Kaizen, while others were also confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry. I just remembered something funny.&#34; He grinned. &#34;Dinner was delightful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad for that. We all worked on it for quite a while Dr.&#34; I said almost calling him &#39;the Horned One&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can tell.&#34; He got up and shook wrists with Kaizen. &#34;I think it best you two talk upstairs after we leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He vanished, and everyone was surprised, and excited that our dinner went well. I was too since I was the only one who knew we entertained someone like him. He must get a kick out of pretending to be supernatural. It&#39;s why I could never pinpoint what he was supposed to be</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard the man.&#34; Said Kaizen. I wondered did he know too, but I went upstairs to our bedroom</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what happened in Hell?&#34; I asked when he closed the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was allowed a wish, that&#39;s how I secured our sons&#39; safety Also, I am now equal with Uriel in power, and I&#39;ve been sneaking out about 7 hours a night to train&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At first I was gone only an hour or two but my trainer every night shows me how green I am.&#34; He said all at once. &#34;I wished that my strength befit my title, but it means nothing if I&#39;m too inexperienced to actually do anything. Please say something little mate, I feel ashamed as it is that I hid this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. I understand why, but you still shouldn&#39;t have.&#34; I said a little bitterly. &#34;I know you want to keep me safe, even my feelings, but don&#39;t hide so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I told you after I Just calmed you down, you&#39;d still be stressed out.&#34; He countered. &#34;I won&#39;t argue, you&#39;re right, but I am too. Can we leave it at that, so I can hold you, and tell you it&#39;ll be alright?&#34; He came in and hugged me gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It did feel nice, but I bit his hand when he tried petting my hair. I couldn&#39;t mar his skin, not that I wanted to. I just wanted to prove a bit of a point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that&#39;s just Mean. I try to apologize, and I get *attacked*.&#34; He grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, and take this too.&#34; I said having to crane up, and he bent down to kiss me. &#34;I&#39;m still a little perturbed at you.&#34; I glared. &#34;But I think I get it You&#39;re doing what you think will keep me safe, but hiding things can&#39;t happen I fell almost disrespected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was not my intention. I knew I shouldn&#39;t have hidden this.&#34; He looked down, frustrated at himself. &#34;I hide nothing else forgive me, my most precious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed me I think as gently as he could, picking me up slightly, but carefully. He held me like I was made of glass and put his tongue in my mouth. He smelled like power like my instincts screamed that the man in front of me was in charge. That he was Alpha and it turned me on.</p>
