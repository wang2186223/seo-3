                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d made it to the city, and it was Late, about 2 am, but the goblins establishment was 24 hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had a small casino, a hotel, and some other things. But most of all it was secret. No human would ever know that this was what it was. In the front was a restaurant, and in the restroom, in the last stall was a special unisex bathroom that so long as you were supernatural and touched it, it revealed a door and a tunnel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This place was massive and there was a small line. It seemed this was how supernatural people did business. It was a bank, casino, hotel, bar, grill, a mall and even had some indoor rides... but the outside looked like a normal diner. All this stuff was underground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were next, and it was our turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening. How may I help?&#34; Asked the goblin woman she was small and green, in a stool that adjusted its height.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evening. I need a new card, and an alias on it, as well as a new ID. Oh and I also want to add a card for my mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have a name in mind?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kyle? Kyle . Ford?&#34; He said more as a question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the lady?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; I said with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to change your information. Pick a name. but use the last name I picked.&#34; He encouraged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um Hanna Ford?&#34; I said and he nodded. It was literally a random name off the top of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stand over there for new Id photos please.&#34; She said pointing to a blue screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did as I was told, and he did too. This was almost like the DMV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, 28.90 million is now dispersed on your new cards. That includes the fees, a one night stay, an all access pass to the park, redeemable anytime, and a new license plate on the house your highness.This Also includes sovereignty from even the orders of our own king, since I added the privacy fee as well. Would you like anything else?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen was a millionaire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would also like to be married.&#34; He said with a smile. I did too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh and a marriage certificate. This is an official legal document. Congratulations.&#34;  She said popping a confetti gun. She then pulled out a case of rings I could only dream of wanting on Pinneytrest.. one was a purple eternity band... it flashed reds and blues in the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your ring size?&#34; He asked. It was 7. &#34;I want you to say it.&#34; He grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;7&#34; I said sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like the 6 carat eternity band, blessed with a protection charm for an additional 3 million?&#34; she asked. &#34;It&#39;s purple diamond, mined near the In-Between, the closest a mortal can get to the spirit world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; It was my dream ring, I always loved baguette cut channel set rings... but I could NEVER afford that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead. You forget I hear you.&#34; He grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it&#39;s so much!&#34; I protested but he ignored me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enjoy your stay.&#34; She bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put it on my finger, and grinned. &#34;Money as I&#39;ve said means nothing.&#34; He said taking my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you may not get more so easily.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if I became poor, I&#39;m still a wolf. I could work for another king probably. I KNOW the Goblin King would take me in. He&#39;s been dying to get one of us on his payroll since before I was born. He offered my father 4 billion dollars for one of us as pups.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; is that why you have the tattoo of the Horned One on your belly button?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Grandfather did that himself the day we were born. I actually remember that. Being a demigod makes it. Hard to forget things. The others won&#39;t admit it, but I will.&#34; He said like that was Normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Ace and his people were already inside the hotel part. Kaizen forbade them from going to the casino, but they could ride the rides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;ll play some cards.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;It says in elvish there that the payout for blackjack is double your money tonight.&#34; He beamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hypocrite.&#34; I said playfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mind Reading Hypocrite.&#34; He chuckled, opening the door for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d never seen so many slot machines, and I&#39;d gone to Vagus to celebrate my uni graduation.. Games, food, women shifted into their true forms they were goat ladies but their legs were bare, showing their asses He held my hand, leading me to a table with a man polishing a glass it was the cards table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took me to the table, and I stood next to him. They gave him 20, million dollar chips at his request. He slid them all in the center like an Idiot, but I said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you Sure you want to do this sir?&#34; Asked the man shuffling cards. He had horns like a bull. His hair was dark, shaggy, and almost unkept it was so curly. &#34;If you win, an additional 40 million dollars will be forwarded to your account.&#34; He said with a serious scowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead minotaur.&#34; He grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen watched him like a hawk as he delt the cards his eyes were that strange  dark brown and red iris I hated when the white of his eyes changed to that brown the most it reminded me too much of the evil stories I was told growing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;ll retire.&#34; Said Kaizen. He looked serious. There was no passive smile to his face at the moment</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Play one more time double or nothing.&#34; Encouraged the man. He pressed a button, even I heard the click, and soon we were surrounded</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I Cheat?&#34; He asked taking off his shirt, pants. Boxers shoes And socks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is unnecessary.&#34; Huffed a guard. &#34;Your majesty play him again please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I know I&#39;ll lose. I won Too much.&#34; He said with folded arms, shaking, then shimming on each article of clothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well. He wasn&#39;t cheating at least.&#34; Said the most well-dressed guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get the manager.&#34; Said another guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like to come with us?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever.&#34; Said Kaizen.  He got up, and I followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They said nothing to me, but I got glancing glares as I rode the elevator with them. In the office on the bottom floor, the gaudily dressed manager was in a tailored suitHe was a darker green than the goblins upstairs, but he also looked a little  stuffed in his suit. He also had a top hat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I&#39;ll be damned&#34; He said with a small bow. &#34;I&#39;m Wix my lord, Crown Prince Wix&#39;lek. This whole state&#39;s my domain. You&#39;re safe from persecution here as long as you don&#39;t piss off my father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He cheats.&#34; Said one of the security guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I actually don&#39;t.&#34; said Kaizen calmly. &#34;And I&#39;m trying for my mate&#39;s sake to be civil about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Rogue or Not I Know a Literal Fucking Grandchild of the Horned One wouldn&#39;t cheat in a casino He&#39;s just in his element. Double or nothing kid. I get as many chances as I want. I swear on my sinnin&#39; soul no cheats, takesies backsies or foul play.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But boss...&#34; one said as if he was Sure Kaizen cheated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up and Watch Close those. Hellish eyes son.&#34; He pulled a deck of cards out and shuffled them, then tossed them to a guard. &#34;Shuffle um too. Eyes closed. No mind reading here...&#34; He said to the minotaur with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard fumbled with them, but they were shuffled while they found something to cover his eyes, so no one could say he was peaking so no one knew what cards were which.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now toss them back.&#34; He said drawing a card on his table from two thirds down not the middle or the ends. &#34;A one in fifty two chance what card is this?&#34; he put it back, and pulled out a different card, also not from the first, last, or middle</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Queen of Hearts.&#34; Kaizen said simply. &#34;The first one you pulled was a spade ace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What will this dice roll?&#34; He asked pulling out a a 100 sided copper dice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;94&#34; He said before it was rolled and it was a 94.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;15&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mind one more time?&#34; asked Wix.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;48.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rolled it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will I roll a number 50 and up?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was 49</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You idiots See.? This guy&#39;s blessed by Downstairs himself. Gamblin&#39;s a sin after all  I should know that well enough.&#34; Wix grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bet you want me to get what you lost back.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah. I&#39;m already headed down anyway. First Class of course.&#34; Snickered Wix. &#34;Give the man his money, so says Lord Wix&#39;lek the Unlucky One.&#34; He grinned. &#34;I only ask that One day if I ever call, you come and place a bet for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I can do that. I won&#39;t swear loyalty or anything, but I do owe you one.&#34; He said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understandable. If my sources are correct, you&#39;re directly marked by the Horned One himself.&#34; He said tossing him what looked like a scroll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The deed to a supernaturally gated community. There&#39;s a barrier so humans can&#39;t see ya shift and everything.&#34; He said happily, but Kaizen hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about everyone else?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rogues. Trash. They mooch. I know a mooch when I see one.&#34; Said Wix waggling his finger. &#34;Plus. It really don&#39;t look too good hangin&#39; &#39;round. Jack ya knowHe&#39;s killed at least. I don&#39;t know, a Lot of people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I&#39;m not kiddin&#39; &#39;round. You&#39;ll see. He&#39;s been around longer than he&#39;ll admit but I bet in that twisted mind of his, he knows He&#39;s Older Than Me, a Crown Prince.. Killin&#39; every day. Do the math.&#34; He said seriously. &#34;I&#39;ve been around since the War since before our homeland of Atlantis was sank.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be that as it may, they swore to me so I&#39;m responsible for them.&#34; Said Kaizen with crossed arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Your majesty you play Hard ball how about the 8 bedroom, 6 bath at the end of McCarson Drive?&#34; He asked. &#34;It&#39;s got a wet bar and bathroom in the basement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think human homes get much bigger I&#39;ll take it.&#34; He said shaking wrists with Wix</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There. You can shift anytime you like in the gates. The little ones can go to private school, we&#39;re sovereign, all 650 acres, so no Secret Police I heard about your murder spree. If you want, I can clean your record.&#34; He smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen hesitated again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I Know something like that would have a Real Favor attached to it.&#34; He said with folded arms. &#34;But, I Will take my money, the deed, and the keys to this new house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fine enough for me. Oh and here&#39;s my number. I&#39;ll call you if I need you. Your presence here protects me and mine. Oh, and congratulations on your marriage too. Now go get some fresh air.&#34; He said shooing us out his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We left, but Kaizen headed upstairs to the elevator. We went to the hotel exit instead of the home It could wait until morning... we were safe here by Wix&#39;lek&#39;s words. The goblins had a different king, so they had different rules. Rules that could obviously be bribed away should we get any trouble here.</p>
