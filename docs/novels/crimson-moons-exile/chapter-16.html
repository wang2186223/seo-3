                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mature</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was already in his lap, but he pulled me a little closer, and moved the collar of my shirt to the side. I was nervous seeing how long his fangs were. &#34;Are you sure?&#34; He asked looking me in the eyes. &#34;I mean it when I say you&#39;ll be reallyReally horny.but you will also share my immortality &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I understood by the way he said it, that this was permanent He&#39;d said this bond was unbreakable I wanted that I wanted a mate hell I even wanted the sex Up until this point I&#39;d never found anyone who was good in bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bit me with a snarl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crook of my neck burned, then cooled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt like I&#39;d been thrown into a lake. It hurt like an ear piercing, but the rush of all his feelings flooded my mind I feel his pain, that he could never see his family again, but the joy in that he&#39;d found his matethat seemed to replace his sorrows. it was something he never thought about, but now that he had me, he would go to the end of the world for me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mate. Go ahead... claim your fallen prince.&#34; He mumbled, lifting me sitting down with me in his hold so I could be in his lap I already felt the lump there</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright&#34; I said knowing it was my turn... I put my knees on his thighs while he held me in his arms. He looked proud like I honored him by accepting feelings that I knew I already had I just never had the time to really examine them...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit as hard as I could, but I couldn&#39;t do anything to him. I subconsciously felt my mark it pulsed... but I hadn&#39;t put anything on him when I pulled away He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That will do. The intention is what&#39;s important.&#34; He said kissing me, leaning forward until I was laid on my back near the campfire. As he did so, I felt that the ground was warm. His touch scorched the earth underneath me, making a perfect rectangle of warm, firm ground</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed me like I&#39;d run away, holding my sides, grinding his member gently on me, even though we both were clothed. I moaned loudlyThe friction was making me wet He sucked the side of my neck where he marked me, and nibbled my earlobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had my hands on his chest. He was muscular, holding abs of marble, hot as boiling water</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly started to pull off my shirt, but he helped me take it off faster, and undid my bra.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Won&#39;t someone see?&#34; I asked a little shyly I feltlike a mouse under such and intense gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t sense anyone but if you&#39;re nervous, we can go back to the village.&#34; He offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. Did I Want to go back......?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What would be the point of starting something but not finishing. Plus I wholeheartedly accepted the mate process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep going.&#34; I said wiggling to remove my pants and panties the urge to keep going was insatiable but that wasn&#39;t why I wanted to continue. It wasn&#39;t the magic of the marking either. I wanted this. I wanted to spend my life with this man</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled off his pants and boxers He was Large four fingers wideand as he&#39;d said earlier a foot long but he only grinned he&#39;d heard me. &#34;Biggest in the locker room.&#34; He said making sure I was on the &#39;towel&#39; He leaned down... putting a finger in me. &#34;I don&#39;t even think there&#39;s room for another one.&#34; He said opening my legs wide</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped. It was Just a finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So responsive.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was Not enough. The feel of it inside me made me moan a little he&#39;d added that second finger. It glided in and out, but I wanted more He stroked steadily, slowly at first, but he went faster at an inclining pace, and I could feel him touch my button with every thrust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about your claws?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mate your question makes no sense. They&#39;re put away.&#34; He said putting his thumb on my button proper, going in little circles  The other hand kneaded my breast. I could feel myself building I could feel my wetness make his motions smoother &#34;But I will ask you a question too do you want More than just some fingers?&#34; He asked. He knew the answer, he just wanted  me to say it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pumped them in and out of me I was wet I wanted him in me there was a need that craved to be met</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you inside.&#34; I hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lip to hold a hum. He&#39;d added a third finger Now a fourth. it was so slow it was torture, but so good if he asked me to beg I Would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Patience.&#34; He said with a grin. He leaned up and kissed me while fingering me his thumb on my button made me arch my back. Every touch was a sensation it was nearly overwhelming. This was the connection I craved but never found until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His ravenous kiss trailed down my torso he licked each nipple, and nipped my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He removed his fingers, and replaced it with his tongueI could feel myself start to climb, much faster.I grabbed his hair to hold on, and he growled, holding both my sides with his clawed grip but All I could think about was what he was doing I moaned, shifting my hips, feeling the rhythm of a man so strong he lifted me up with a small growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. I came. He hadn&#39;t put it in yet, but he knew all the right places</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped, moaning loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you&#39;re ready.&#34; He said still going</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; I asked. He temporarily stopped to reach for his pants. He picked me up, and placed me in his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll see.&#34; He smiled. He picked them up, using one hand so I could still be comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fumbled around for a condom out his wallet, and slid it on, tossing it to the side He put the head of his cock on my button and slid it down slowly. Then back up. The Teasing was tormenting pleasure. He swirled his tip around my button only a few times, before dipping Just before my entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted him to do it it was like he was hesitating he had me supported with one hand, while I held onto his arms he was so tense his muscles were firmer than the dirt under us I wrapped my legs around his waist while he was on his knees holding me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bit my neck and put himself inside me. He went slow he growled as he did so but his smooth strokes felt like bliss He held my sides, bouncing me up and down, kissing me on the spot where he marked me that bite pulsed with only pleasure, sending signals directly to my entrance it made me clamp around him tighter with each touch it was its own arousing sensation</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My legs were wrapped around him, feeling him go in circular motions after every pump I climbed. My walls were tighter around him, while he grunted with heavy breaths. I moaned, throwing my head back I let him have his wicked way with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed a breast and kneaded it, while using one arm to support me now. He kissed me, and our tongues danced. I could feel his fangs. They were sharp, like he wanted to mark me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already marked you I just want to keep fucking you.&#34; He said going faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With nearly every pull, he almost exited me, but he slammed into me proper with every push. He removed his hand off my breast, and thumbed my button the combination was bliss. I climbed, and fell off the edge, screaming as he did so. He roared, going faster, pumping into me with inhuman speed. I closed my eyes, throwing my head back. I could feel myself climb again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted me up, standing completely, still not finished himself. I could feel my walls tighten around him, being so big He held me firmly, plunging into me while all I could do was hold onto his wrists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harder.&#34; I tried to say firmly, but it was more of a beg</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said nothing, ramming into me. I don&#39;t know what came over me I didn&#39;t Care. I wanted him to keep going &#34;You&#39;re so tight.&#34; He said with a snarl. It was like he was somehow not giving me the full treatment of what he can do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck me.&#34; I said holding his wrists as hard as I could. My nails dug into his skin, and he only panted in response. It felt like fireworks I didn&#39;t want him to stop I climbed, feeling myself about to fall over the edge again. I threw my head back as he snarled one last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck.&#34; He pretty much roared, puffing fire and smoke. He kissed me passionately, cumming in me with a pulsing force I felt he ran his arms up and down my sides, grunting, pumping into me one last forceful time it was then that I came again the strongest pulse yet I damn near saw stars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what came over me.&#34; I said ashamed, but he put a finger under my chin, and kissed my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t either, but if you keep that up, I might accidently shift.&#34; He warned but I could tell he was being playful. My connection with him &#34;And never Ever be ashamed&#34; he kissed my forehead and he stroked my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rested my head on his chest. I was still panting so was he. He slowly slid out of me, and took off the condom He spat a small ball of fire to &#39;clean&#39; our spot out here. A pretty good patch of the grass was destroyed with it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Want to bathe in the river?&#34; He said holding me like I&#39;d run awayI held the clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Really cold, but I&#39;ve never done it before.&#34; I said seeing him grin wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a shallow, but wide stream, the same one from his galloping around earlier I didn&#39;t even notice it until now. We were only a few paces away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s beautiful.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As cheesy as it is nothing is more so than your smile. I thought I didn&#39;t want a mate&#34; He said happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought I&#39;d become a crazy cat lady.&#34; I said sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that? Are you related to cat shifters?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No it&#39;s a person who owns a lot of domestic cats. They usually live alone I&#39;d made my mind up that I would settle if I didn&#39;t find a husband, but then I tried the dating scene and nobody clicked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It sounds like you were pressuring yourself as much as the royal Court wanted me to marry one of their grandchildren.&#34; He grumbled. &#34;But now nobody has to &#39;settle&#39; I have You I will love you and you will never have to worry of a wondering eye There&#39;s a tattoo shop and a jewelry store&#34; he mumbled. &#34;I can&#39;t wear jewelry, but tell me, what kind of ring would you like?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest, I&#39;ve always wanted an eternity band of diamonds.&#34; I sheepishly admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spend as much as you like. We can pick one out for you, and I can get my finger tattooed to be honest I kind of always wanted to do that.&#34; He said placing my naked body slowly in the water with him. It was cold, but with him, it was worth it I had no regrets. Magic was real and regardless of what I was taught about creatures like him, this was a blessing.</p>
