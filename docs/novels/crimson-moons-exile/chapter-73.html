                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat next to Uriel while Diana drove, holding Herculian&#39;s hand. The Unicorn&#39;s tears fixed Rodrick&#39;s book, but the human nearly took my actions personally. The unicorn while powered down was still slightly shiny, glittery even like his title. He smelled like sugar, and I had to roll down the window because it was a little much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t help it.&#34; He complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not mad about it. I know I smell like Hell to you, pun intended.&#34; I said with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop being bad back there or you won&#39;t get any more Whippers.&#34; Threatened Herculian, turning around slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You Wouldn&#39;t.&#34; I hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I would.&#34; He said like a dad about to &#39;turn the car around&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway, what&#39;s Haven Like?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s hell like?&#34; Asked Uriel. He looked genuinely curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think before I was born, it was just one endless plain of suffering for all, but now it has Layers. The truly evil still go into the Pit, but those who can be rehabilitated are tormented, forced to live their sin through penance and punishment I got a chance to experience it myself&#34; I cringed. &#34;In the end it was worth it but for most it can last so long, some go mad They are thrown in the Pit as a mercy, since their souls lose their ability to be rehabilitated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a punishment for those who go too far, like with The Great Wild.&#34; Said Diana. &#34;Lia is. A little sadistic. Those who displease her may suffer for eternity before Death porters them to the Pit Those who please her wind up the Lia&#39;s afterlife. You may hunt and roam free There are no official structures there, but you are allowed to build something yourself, or live in the makeshift villages. There is no technology, except stone or obsidian hand tools. There are no grains there, but nearly everything is edible even the wood if you boil it If you wish to be like a shifter, you may ask it, but you may only pick One animal.&#34; She smiled. &#34;Foxes are the most coveted, since they over time gain magical abilities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That sounds neat.&#34; I mumbled. &#34;And they are. Demons can be stripped of their power, or moved to a more suitable layer, like the Pit Layer. Those souls are all mostly lost causes, being pretty much punished for their crimes before their ultimate end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left out major details. I knew to topography of every layer; I knew the generals especially the Layer of Murder and Lord Slah-hesh&#39;Rrah&#39;s fighting style. I&#39;m sure they knew the major lords, and fought with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt stronger than them. He was the Light&#39;s trump card, probably meant to stay dead until he was needed, thus the &#39;Lesser&#34; Champion title. His resurrection after death seemed to only be &#39;as needed&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope I&#39;m not being too nosy. I&#39;m also sure my master already knows everything you&#39;re saying, so don&#39;t worry about betraying your grandfather.&#34; He said with a soft smile. I did have a pretty serious look on my face, it wasn&#39;t that he could hear me thankfully He looked like one of the angels as he said that strangely enough</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the City of Repentance like?&#34; Herculian asked. I didn&#39;t say or think anything about the great city, so they did know some things already. It has other names, but I just stuck with the one they knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well it&#39;s a big Roman city with electricity. Grandfather tried to make it as much like mortal life as possible. They get jobs and everything, since that Layer was made for the innocent who were killed by us, or the truly repentant. If they want a second chance, at every convenience store is a lottery ticket. There&#39;s daily draws, and the winners get a random incarnation. But no soul goes to Repentance twice Should they return a sinner with an X on their soul, it will automatically be black. They are thrown into the pit the same day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The City of Radiance is light and pure even souls without wings may float through the air and live carefree. The ground is soft clouds, and there is no need for food, since no one gets hungry. The city is vast, and modern. Every convenience including food replicates are at a beckon call if you&#39;re feeling nostalgic, and incarnation is pretty much on request There are no lines or waits There is no money or worry. The mortal souls there have complete, blissful peace. There Are different levels, though, even the lowest one designed for those who Just Barely made the cut live this way. Then there&#39;s the master&#39;s brother and His realm.&#34; Uriel grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard about the nickname: Upper Hell.&#34; I chuckled. &#34;I heard the God of Mercy likes pulling off fingers and hands of those who fail his impossible tests. That those souls&#39; journeys is like the Layers, only with less intensity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is that funny?&#34; He asked with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because it just is. I said honestly. &#34;Haven sounds boring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It isn&#39;t! I got to train every day without needing sleep, feeling tired nor rest. Time moves differently too, so I was there ten times Urth time Look at what just a few thousand years did.&#34; He was referring to his powers</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t lie, I saw your muscles through your fur.&#34; I said with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I you. You&#39;re just young. You scent about a century. I&#39;ve had many of your lifetimes to hone my skills. Be patient.&#34; Said Uriel. &#34;When you get to my level, I&#39;ll teach you swordplay if the master permits it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you guys want to stop to sleep?&#34; Asked Diana. She yawned while driving. We&#39;d only gone about 4 hours on the road, but honestly there was no way we could do a 20 hour drive after that battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; We all said at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>----Willow-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellio glared at the toaster as if it were a foe to vanquish, and I silently hoped when it popped, he wouldn&#39;t &#39;kill&#39; it like he did the microwave. And the fridge..and the remote</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The toaster popped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get away from my mother!&#34; Shouted Ellio, blasting the toaster with a fireball As the grandson of Eternya, he may not have had wings, but he carried the same flames. It burned through the fire blanket Flora had in advance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kitchen was now ablaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO! It&#39;s not alive!&#34; Yelled Flora, getting no help from Eternya. I could hear him laughing on the roof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It Moved!&#34; He yelled grabbing her and taking her out the house while Chelsea already had the fire extinguisher. He shifted, ripping up his clothes, carrying her away while the rest, except Alavastros ran in a herd with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll . I&#39;ll go get them.&#34; He said sheepishly, shifting and running away too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god&#34; I facepalmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was my fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was also the second time the kitchen caught fire, but it was also the last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kitchen burned too hot for the extinguisher to do anything, and Chealsea wound up having to use magic with two other witches, but the damage was done..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a whole in the house about 7 feet in diameter. And you could see outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.Sorry&#34; Ellio said sheepishly Naked and shifted . He ruined the last pair of Kaizen&#39;s jeans, so I linked Rick while he was still out to go get some and a new toasterBut where would we even plug it in now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smoke and stench of plastic rose high above the house, and nosy neighbors were actually helpful, aiding me in evacuation and offering me condolences</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright. Jack can you go get the construction crew back and someone who knows if the house is still safe.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes my lady.&#34; He said materializing and vanishing behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I played off how startling that was He needs a bell!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still felt really guilty that he couldn&#39;t take Eternya but as a General of the Realm King I doubt anyone really could. Not alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Holy Shit Woo!&#34; Yelled Eternya on the roof. He had chips, beers, salsa.. and a witch up there with him. She sat in his lap with a crystal ball</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop having a good time and come help!&#34;  I yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine!&#34; He complained. He gave the witch two feathers. &#34;Is that fair compensation fire mage?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye sir.&#34; She said blushing. I face palmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could bet money she wanted to ride him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard that.&#34; He grinned. &#34;I will have you know I don&#39;t have parties anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah more like *can&#39;t*. I bet Xaxas made you cut it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did.&#34; He said behind me, and I screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bells! Everyone needs bells!&#34; I shouted. &#34;Hi Harmony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s Samira?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; I said sheepishly. &#34;The house caught fire so&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; Harmony yelled. &#34;How did I not notice?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nobody got hurt It&#39;s kind of my fault, but Samira is now my priority.&#34; I said with her nodding in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire department was arriving as I spoke. The house was already evacuated, but what surprised me were her wet tears. She was with Noah, but he looked alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?!&#34; I asked with concern as me and Harmony ran for her support, but she was not consolable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t see? Oh right&#34; Said Xaxas. &#34;Tyson will be resurrected by midnight, but they won the battle with Contradiction. He&#39;s been thrown in the pit, and everyone else was healed by Uriel. But honestly, they&#39;re so tired they stopped to rest a bit. I vowed my hands off, so I cannot teleport them until their journey is over. The signal of that would be either a party, or they step foot in their place of residence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s only &#39;til midnight. Right now, it&#39;s 4:42&#34; I said as encouragement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crash in the kitchen wasn&#39;t exactly a good thing, but I&#39;m sure we could figure it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll fix your house, You deal with. All that.&#34; He said referring to how hurt Samira was. He didn&#39;t mean it in a rude way, but I doubt someone like him knew what to do with consoling someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a snap, the house was fixed.and he added another floor. I couldn&#39;t focus on what he decided to do though, because Samira was really sweet. And seeing her sad made me feel for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But thankfully this was only temporary Midnight would come soon...</p>
