                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re finally home baby.&#34; Said Kaizen gently. His touch was warm and comforting as he touched my shoulder, just shy of my mark spot</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hummed rubbing my eyes, and I leaned on him as he slowed to park. I wasn&#39;t expecting the neighborhood to be empty, but it was apparent why when we got home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow.&#34; I mumbled. &#34;Did you know they planned this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We parked, pulling into our garage, and there were streamers, balloons, and everyone Every single person who lived in Misfit was on the lawn. It had to be even Tamriel was there, talking with a pale woman. That had to be his wife, and the nearly identical man next to him was his son. They were both stern faced discussing something while she smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow indeed No.&#34; Said Kaizen. We got out the car, and there were cheers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha&#39;s Back!&#34; Waved Yuka. &#34;Valery had her baby!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll visit her after the party.&#34; Said Kaizen casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a girl!&#34; Said Rick. &#34;So many pups were born last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The moon was full 5 days in a row; I&#39;m pretty sure at least half the women here are pregnant.&#34; Said my mate. &#34;Any who smell of citrus and grapefruit, you better start buying baby supplies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a small silence before there were more cheers</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was too loud and too smelly but at the same time, it was home. I I held myself from shedding a few tears. We didn&#39;t have to run anymore We didn&#39;t have to worry about the lives of all these people People who could now have families. Who didn&#39;t have to worry about their babies</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was kissed on the top of the head, and Kaizen snarled. &#34;I see even Flora&#39;s here!&#34; He yelled, and there were chuckles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Someone had to be the voice of reason around here.&#34; She huffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for protecting the children.&#34; He said shaking his head. &#34;I have been pardoned, and, damn it, hold on...&#34; He went back to the car, pulling out paperwork in a black and gold trimmed manilla folder. It carried a wax seal stamped with their royal crest on it. &#34;With This, not only are we pardoned, but with my authority, MisfitMoon is Officially a pack!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The roar of excited people made my head hurt but seeing everyone so happy was worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Today, let us celebrate and tonight, Lord willing I will patrol with those who wish to be Warriors. rest at 3am, get up at 9am, and all of you bring your paperwork. I won&#39;t close my office until every new ID is printed. And every file is sent to the King.&#34; He smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha will Warriors get paid?&#34; Asked a random werewolf. I knew instantly now what species each individual was. And if I was stronger I think Kaizen, the angels, and one more person was but everyone else scented weaker. Neat. I could also smell something spicy off the witches.. did magic smell spicy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts got interrupted. Someone popped a cork and wine arced high in the air, but they were way too short to see who it was. They were picked up by a blue skinned man, a troll. It was Wix.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard you burned the castle down young prince!&#34; He laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. I felt 2 feet tall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen laughed, grinning at me. &#34;No. that was Willow, Princess Willow, The Horned Kitsune did that her first shift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone laughed, at my expense of course I elbowed him. He only chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Holy Shit I have Two in my collec- I mean Two *Allies* in my fold.&#34; He grinned ear to ear All the goblin and troll kin laughed. &#34;Move out the way kid.&#34; He grumbled at a random werewolf, motioning the troll to move forward. People moved out of his way, and a small sea was parted for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmhmm.&#34; Siad Kaizen. &#34;Come speak with me King Wix. I have words to share.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The troll put him down and now, the sea of people parted way for us as we went inside my horns came out on their own; I still didn&#39;t have control over that. Nor could I process all the new smells.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone had their own scent. But oddly enough, in my head as overwhelming as all this was, and as intense as these scents were, it made me calm. Even the overstimulating sounds were welcome. It was like I knew this was where I was meant to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is.&#34; Whispered Kaizen in my ear. &#34;You are my mate, wife, and Luna You will naturally figure out how to block this out, but I bet I could ask for a small charm to help you block thoughts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry if I&#39;m butting in, but I happen to have one in my office. I&#39;ll send for it.&#34; Said Wix, pulling out his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d like that.&#34; I said not realizing that I&#39;d have that ability too It was so Loud.maybe I did hear others? &#34;What about the protection charm on my wedding ring?&#34; I asked. This thing costs literally a small fortune; it better work!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t feel anything from it anymore.&#34; Said Kaizen. It shifted with you so maybe grandfather ruined the charm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made sense, but our conversation was interrupted</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were handed beers, a solid plate of grilled beef, and BBQ sauce was slathered overtop. I didn&#39;t even finish my first plate, but it was so good More food was added. Ribs, chicken drumsticks, steak, and smoked ham off the grill was stacked highI&#39;d had other food since we left but that was just generic fast food This was made with LOVE. I was distracted as they spoke. I even growled as I ate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget to eat the bone.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;You&#39;re a fox, but the beef might not be enough to keep you full.&#34; He warned. &#34;We digest meat much faster than mortals, but the calcium slows us down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; I said trying, then with some effort I broke through a beef rib. I impressed and horrified myself. I could feel my fangs with my teeth It was automatically done; I didn&#39;t think about it to do it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try this!&#34; I said putting a chicken drumstick in front of his mouth, and he took the whole damn thing! His little growl at the end of it made me show him my teeth. &#34;Hey!&#34; I complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grinned, &#34;Oh, that&#39;s Cute. But Sorry.&#34; He said sheepishly, but he didn&#39;t mean it! Kaizen, and the other werewolves giggled at his antics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My plate was piled high before I could continue to protest</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smell of food, scents of people I knew, and attaching faces to those scents knowing that mine and Kaizen&#39;s was mixed in on them since they were pack. that all the people carried the smallest scent of my mate. I was kind of distracted. Thankfully, those two seemed to be unaffected. I followed them up the stairs to a guest room that had the bed removed. I sat, stuffing my face I was hungry</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They put a desk inside, and the three chairs, computer, and phone was likely to help him attend to his duties as Alpha. His family listed off a bunch of large tasks, but Misfit was official as of yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry I followed Alpha.&#34; Said Rick. &#34;We wanted to surprise you with the office, but you already found it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m surprised. Thank you Rick. Your idea was good.&#34; He smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rick bowed leaving, and Wix got into the guest chair. There were still dressers and bedroom stuff in here, but Kaizen didn&#39;t seem to mind. I didn&#39;t either. We could probably use that furniture to store the information we&#39;d get tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well your highness, I think I already know what you want. I want the same.&#34; Said Wix, sliding keys across the table when we sat down. &#34;Tamriel should be up soon; it isn&#39;t often that he&#39;s allowed to be down here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it *that* bad? I haven&#39;t even been gone a full week.&#34; He grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is A white minotaur stalks the forest and he&#39;s being chased by Headhunters. Normally, we&#39;d let him get killed, but he&#39;s so close, that when they get him, they&#39;ll find us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh come On!&#34; Growled Kaizen. &#34;I KNOW my scent is still out there; that should have deterred him from coming this way...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It rained after you left for a full 24 hours. We got Sentinel and Tamriel, but they won&#39;t use their powers unless their master permits itand they only protect the houses.&#34; He scratched his chin. &#34;They said they&#39;d contact The Man King if they need to, but I personally know that mortal. Rodrick won&#39;t deal with the mindless beast unless it endangers humans, and there aren&#39;t any here since Willow is now stamped And changed by the Horned One.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then after the party we could make an arrangement.&#34; Said Kaizen; they shook wrists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already set it up. I live here too; so do my wife and kids.&#34; He said seriously. &#34;The peace out here is nicer than the enormous facility we have in town ya know. But for some reason, and I don&#39;t know why I don&#39;t want you to send Jack and Gilbert to handle it. I know they could. For some reason do you think you could make it drink your blood?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe? He&#39;s not a wolf, but all who drink become part of grandfather&#39;s fold. If it isn&#39;t possible, I&#39;m pretty sure he wouldn&#39;t mind adding a white minotaur to his fold. That sounds incredibly rare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is Minotaur are not able to be Any other color than blonde, brown, or black unless their albino and he isn&#39;t. His eyes are brown, not blue or pink.&#34; He slid his phone across the table. &#34;Look at that shine that&#39;s too glittery for his mother to be a mortal Oh, you wouldn&#39;t know. Humans who breed with beasts make half beasts.&#34; He said honestly. &#34;Well, any female. It just needs to be a woman and a beast, demon without a mortal form, or flesh puppet magic. Their creation is meant to originally be a punishment by the gods but some are born with minds now. It&#39;s like a coin I doubt this one has a mind, but at the same time I KNOW something this rare would have been picked up by my old man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fishy.&#34; Mumbled Kaizen. &#34;He looks kind of familiar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Asked Wix.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know a few minotaur. Maybe one of the locals had a love child.&#34; He said scratching his chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A second-generation minotaur is like flipping two coins a third three. It gets rarer and rarer that they&#39;re stable the more they&#39;re bred.&#34; Said Wix.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that part I didn&#39;t know.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry to interrupt boss and horny boss.&#34; Said a dark-skinned blue troll. He had a black jewelry box, and handed it to me before leaving swiftly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; I yelled so he could hear me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have to admit the moment I put on the small gold, black stoned necklace, the headache was gone.</p>
