                <p>6 days later</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wore a black dress while Kaizen matched me in a tuxedo</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know Why Kaizen asked me to dress so formally, while he was in a suit as well, but we were already leaving. It was only noon, and the skies were clear too. Also, with Ace swearing that he&#39;d watch the place, my mate didn&#39;t mind going out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rode in the car with Kaizen. He said he&#39;d wanted to do something special for me, but he didn&#39;t say what it was he was going to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel wrong.&#34; He said silently. &#34;It&#39;s Wrong that I have you in danger all the time I&#39;m supposed to be your mate I&#39;m supposed to make you happy. I feel less than a man that I can&#39;t give you the comfort and safety that should come with my claws.&#34; He said making a right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Kaizen, I agreed to this to All of you AND your troubles for this.&#34; I said grabbing his hand, and putting it on my chest. &#34;Wherever we go, so long as its together I don&#39;t mind.&#34; I said silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled softly. &#34;Willow We stay here in this suburban neighborhood hiding away like Rats.&#34; He said shaking his head &#34;We should be on a cruise, visiting my sister, vacationing on Xaxas&#39;s island Anything This is the least I could do.&#34; He drove out the gated community.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh and look, the H.O.A. changed the name.&#34; He pointed. &#34;It says &#39;Misfit Estates&#39; now, my suggestion.&#34; He beamed proudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest, I don&#39;t rightly remember the original name.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry. It was originally &#39;Glittering Estates&#39;, but there was a spell to prevent humans from remembering the name. The Goblins did that so it would be harder to find. It won&#39;t work on someone like me or my siblings, nor magic casters, but a lot of people worked together to shield this place. I just so happened to suggest it when they were renewing the spell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That sounds kind of cool.&#34; I mumbled. That was probably done on purpose to make us feel more at home. And I could also get why they wanted to keep this place a secret. There was so much land, and nice people Kaizen&#39;s status or not, I hadn&#39;t had any unpleasant encounters with anyone except Lord Tamriel and he&#39;d only done that because he worried of Kaizen&#39;s state of mind. And our neighbor too, but Flora hasn&#39;t acted like that since the cookout</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t defend that asshat. If he Really wanted to test me the Right way, he could have just confronted Me from the start.&#34; He complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t wrong. &#34;At least there&#39;s peace now.&#34; I said happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, and I didn&#39;t expect Gilbert or Jack to fit in so well. Especially Jack. That man lives and breathes the hunt.&#34; He shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that why you gave him your blood too?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup.&#34; He popped the p. &#34;We couldn&#39;t be out here if I didn&#39;t. It links them to me, and makes them servants. When I die, they do too, nor can they disobey my ruling. I told them they weren&#39;t allowed to kill anything higher than deer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we going?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice try.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gods I love you.&#34; He said showing his fangs as he smiled. &#34;You&#39;re really cute. A she wolf wouldn&#39;t be bold They would kneel to my slightest hint of aggression or displeasure You challenge me, play along with me I don&#39;t&#39; know why I&#39;m saying all this Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you too, you big furball.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you pick up that swear?&#34; He asked briefly looking at me. It was a sly grin as if he were proud of my &#39;potty mouth&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry I wanted to try it out..&#34; I said sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. &#34;It isn&#39;t That bad, but please only refer to Me as a fluffball. Calling another wolf that is going to piss them off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll keep that in mind anything else? I know dog related stuff is Really bad.&#34; I said seeing him nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you hear that argument yesterday?&#34; He asked. I did. Two werewolves got into a real fight after one called the other a mutt</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; I said putting my hand on his lap. I did want to know more &#34;Someone said something along the lines of their mate was a fluffball around them too.&#34; It makes me want to know more about his people</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whenever you&#39;re ready; we literally have eternity.&#34; He said growling it held no meaning, but at the same time, it almost sounded like he snarled a pattern. &#34;Can you tell the difference between wolf speech and noise?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No?&#34; I said shaking my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe with a lot of practice. Wolf-speech, mind linking, and body language are probably the most significant parts of wolf culture that you know little about. I wasn&#39;t growling earlier either, that was wolf-speech Hard but possible for mortals to speak But that&#39;s for another time. We&#39;re here.&#34; He pointed to an old barn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked like it was going to fall over if you touched it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Goblin King&#39;s vineyard. There&#39;s a wine tasting today.&#34; He smiled. Their magic kept this place looking like that on the outside. The moment I got out the car, I could see that the collapsing barn was actually a 3 story, brick building. He opened the door for me like a gentleman and I took hold of his elbow A man with blue skin took his keys and parked the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grapes were ripe on vines, and large blue goblins picked them. Some of them were examining them like they were judging where to put their bounty, since there were multiple bins. I couldn&#39;t read the language, but to my understanding, all the different races had their own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goblins speak their own dialect of Elvish. I learned that language while in the Royal Court. The Elf King and Unicorn Queen worked together closely with Tyson.&#34; He said nodding his head at a servant who bowed to him. They were all in a row, coming out holding trays.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside were tables with white cloth on them, and it seemed all kinds of peoples were here they were already chatting, and a little card with our name on it had us at our own couple&#39;s table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled the chair out for me, and ordered a bottle. &#34;Try this.&#34; He said with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wine had two tones. The top layer was clear, but it faded to a deep, almost black red as he poured it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow.&#34; I smiled. I took a sip and I couldn&#39;t taste any alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s called Angel&#39;s Kiss. Tamriel won a battle on this land thousands of years ago, and the magic of both angels and demons fertilize the land to this day. &#34;It&#39;s only made here, once every 20 years, but today is just a regular party.&#34; He said happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lord and Lady Charred, lunch today is Angel&#39;s Kiss braised beef with hand harvested, baked wheat bread, toasted in our brick oven.&#34; Said a blue skinned waiter. &#34;This variety of wheat is suitable for someone such as yourself sire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. I&#39;d like another bottle.&#34; He said raising the empty one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen if you get drunk, I&#39;m driving.&#34; I warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way little wife.&#34; He said handing me his keys I didn&#39;t expect that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away.&#34; Said the waiter with a bow, coming back swiftly. He said nothing, putting a hundred year old bottle on the table old enough to be my great grandpa but to be fair, so was Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snorted a laugh. &#34;Stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; I giggled, knowing full well I&#39;d &#39;said&#39; that on purpose. The plates were presented next, and everyone seemed to be having a great time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We dug in, and honestly I think Kaizen did this as More than Just an apology He wanted to take me on this date &#34;This is nice.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to give you the world little mate That you smile gives me real pride. One day, when this is over I&#39;ll make it up to you.&#34; He said taking my hand and kissing it I felt his love, but also his hurt. &#34;I wish I wish I wasn&#39;t a Rogue&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care.&#34; I said leaning over, and kissing him on the cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen before he could say anything else, on a big wooden box, was Wix&#39;Lek. He had a fork and an empty glass, tapping it lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d show!&#34; He yelled loudly, motioning us with a wide smile. Kaizen was handed a cigar from a black box by a servant, and he cut it with his claw, and lit it with the tip of his finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I almost didn&#39;t, but I couldn&#39;t see myself denying the man who gave me some semblance of fucking peace.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We goblins only want peace. You&#39;re safe with us your highness.&#34; He bowed. &#34;Well. So long as you stay on our lands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kings shouldn&#39;t bow to fallen princes.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fallen princes shouldn&#39;t be downing bottles of wine that can get even dragons drunk.&#34; He countered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were chuckles, and Wix continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know all of you know my titles and crown yada-yada. I wanted this party to celebrate my old man Finally getting some sleep!&#34; He yelled and the goblins cheered. &#34;My old man always traded fair, even when we were doing dirty. I intend on keeping his legacy true. I want us to have integrity loyalty, and safety. I hope Lord Kaizen can aid me in the last part.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will.&#34; He stood. &#34;I recognize the scent of a few of you. All who live in Misfit Estates, know that I have the wolves and even some of the other creatures organized to make MisfitMoon function like a Real pack. He said raising his glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew I made the right choice.&#34; Wix chuckled. &#34;My nuclear deterrent everyone.&#34; He motioned Kaizen and they clapped I had no idea what he meant by that, but I could guess</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were old, crazy creatures out there, and denial of it or not Kaizen was a demigod. His bloodline would keep riffraff away, and his strength would do what his reputation didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right.&#34; He whispered.</p>
