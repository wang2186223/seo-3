                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My husband looked pretty happy for the people, but I could feel his stress as we sat on the couch in the living room... I could do that before my powers but now it seemed like like Kaizen was another piece of me. The bond is so strong that if he got a papercut, I&#39;d probably feel it yet he&#39;d told me about blocking that kind of stuff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss!&#34; Yelled Yuka.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not my problem.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t hear a &#39;no&#39;.&#34; Said Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were doing shots, though to be more interesting, Jack threw knives at a dart board. While Yuka initially volunteered to be in front of it. He thought they were just going to throw darts and it *wasn&#39;t* going to be Jack of all people throwing anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack whistled a tune I&#39;d never heard before. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh shut up, I&#39;m not going to kill you.&#34; He grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Said Kaizen like a parent to a kid who wanted something they weren&#39;t supposed to have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See.&#34; Jack tossed it, missing Yuka&#39;s left ear by literally a hair. The next one perfectly pinned the loose parts of his hoodie and pants with the third and fourth. &#34;Be still.&#34; He complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yuka screamed. &#34;BOSS!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jack only darts.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. &#34;I swear I won&#39;t hurt you too much.&#34; He picked up a dart, but stopped with my mate&#39;s disapproving grunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No blood.&#34; Said Kaizen before he could toss the metal tipped, old fashioned dart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well damn it. This got boring.&#34; He huffed walking away. The look on his face told me he was still up to no good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jack has a lot of enthusiasm.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, he does, but don&#39;t worry about him. He needs permission and I won&#39;t give it.&#34; Said my mate drinking a Miller Heavy. He said they were piss water, and he&#39;d had quite a few. There was a little pile of them in a trash can that was placed near us, and all around the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to go get some water.&#34; I said leaving the safety of my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen was in the living room, and I&#39;d only gone into the kitchen. I didn&#39;t expect to bump into anyone. I&#39;d blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was outside probably with my magic that I didn&#39;t know how to use. I didn&#39;t Want to be out here, but it wasn&#39;t a bad thing either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have fun!&#34; Said Kaizen. I could see him getting up through the open front door. He&#39;d sat there for my sake, but once he saw that I was being kidnapped by &#39;she wolves&#39;, he likely went to get actually drunk. It was a party after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gilbert stood alone, while women came to speak with me. He looked pretty lonely, and there was a small circle around him. It seemed no one wanted anything to do with the lycan. I was told that they were dangerous even to other werewolves since they were loners, and had no sense of pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My goddess. I haven&#39;t spoken to you yet, but welcome Luna.&#34; Said one of the women. She had blonde hair and nearly orange eyes. They damn near glowed in the waning moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; I smiled. &#34;What&#39;s your names.&#34; I asked and they all excitedly squealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Debbie, that&#39;s Artha, and Felicity is, or rather *was* Misfit&#39;s unofficial Den Mother. Mom&#39;s a bear shifter.&#34; She whispered the last part. Debbie smelled like werewolf, but not I didn&#39;t know what creature she was. Now that I thought of it, Artha smelled like a bear but not really?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all shook wrists. &#34;Hopefully when everything gets situated, you can show me the ropes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile was a small one I could tell she was the serious kind of person. She also held an aura about herself that told me she was used to running things and being in charge. Her grizzly brown hair, no pun intended, was to the nape of her neck, yet her eyes were a strange mix of more orange than red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My daughters Debbie and Artha told me to come see you. I don&#39;t have official MoonPack notes, but I was thinking in the morning, that I can give Alpha what I have. We can&#39;t make real ID&#39;s, but our fakes looked pretty good&#34; She mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good. I think I&#39;m going to go see what Gilbert&#39;s up to.&#34; I smiled but they looked worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t trust him. He&#39;ll turn on you.&#34; Warned Felicity. They both looked like their mother, except they were shorter, with felicity being the taller sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen shared his blood and bound him. He, nor jack will turn on us.&#34; I said firmly, and she still looked suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you go to him, we will watch. I have no problem rallying the bears.&#34; She said with a bearlike growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be safe.&#34; I said a little glad that everyone was ready to protect me but I still felt bad for Gilbert. They didn&#39;t want to get any closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could get it though. He smelled kind of unstable and intimidating. I think my instincts went off with Gilbert, as there was a part of me that wanted nothing to do with him, but he&#39;d done nothing to warrant that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi Luna.&#34; He said with a soft smile. He handed me a fresh bottle of water. It seemed he didn&#39;t drink either. &#34;I don&#39;t like the way alcohol makes me feel.&#34; He said to answer my forming question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. It reminds me of old, terrible memories.&#34; I said as he nodded. He knew about what happened, and I chose to change the subject before he asked anything. I was fine, but I didn&#39;t think it right to be so casual about it. &#34;Are you alright out here?&#34; I asked a little concerned for his wellbeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; He smiled. &#34;Lycans do not feel loneliness. We are solitary Luna.&#34; He said shaking his head. &#34;I heard them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, sorry.&#34; I said sheepishly. He laughed a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I think it good that you&#39;re checking on everyone, even we unsavory lot. I even got to find out where I&#39;m from. Ronitus texted me more about not only my father, but my mother&#39;s side, and grandparents.&#34; He said this as I followed him to a cooler, and he got another bottled water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m happy for you, and I know the pack will warm up to you.&#34; I said taking a sip. I was thirsty from all the meat and I had no idea how I managed to eat so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It always bothered me that I didn&#39;t know about my bloodline, because neither of my parents spoke of the old times. I think it hurt them too much Yet here I am now, a relative of a Lower Prince, pardoned and serving his majesty.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And in the morning, my name is legally going to be Ace. Hutchenson.&#34; Ace smiled, coming over for water too. &#34;I was going to originally pick one that started with an &#39;A&#39; but that&#39;s tacky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ironic that I wished to find my family, yet you run from it.&#34; Said Gilbert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your people didn&#39;t fuck over the original Third Seat, try to kill the King, and blackmail the Forth. They left a sour taste in the royal houses&#39; mouths. With me as the last survivor, if not for his majesty, I&#39;d likely already have been tortured because they can&#39;t get their hands on them now and killed to end my line.&#34; He grumbled. &#34;To be fair, I don&#39;t think I Want to have kids, or anything</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Kaizen-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes seeing my grandfather hang out with Jack. They laughed, and I believe it was because he belonged to me. The Horned One didn&#39;t deal with the unredeemable at least not like this. They both had Tarteron Burbon, discussing suggestions for the Layer of Murder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think grandfather intended on keeping him bound to me when I became a General.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I let them have there fun. With the Below King here, no one else would be here. Well, maybe grandma, but if she was here, she&#39;d likely be with-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was trying to share her food. Holy Shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to stop this. Grandfather would probably destroy the entire pack because of a single one of her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on!&#34; I yelled, running, then teleporting to take the plate of the. The?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what they were.burned cupcakes? There were 8 of the small &#39;cakes&#39; on a plate with black frosting. And red sprinkles. They looked homemade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh my Lord and Lady. They *were* homemade..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who&#39;s sick, cruel joke was this!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one was here to save me now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She resisted the urge to blow her cover and hug me, but I gave her a small hug instead. Her visage this time was an old woman looking like a mortal grandma. People probably assumed that she was related to Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at them the frosting covered the burned tops and the frosting looked homemade. Lord. It was *all* . Homemade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmm They&#39;re so good. I&#39;ll take these.&#34;  I said &#39;happily&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clapped. &#34;I should have made more! I&#39;m *really* getting the hang of this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You *really* are grandma..&#34; I said taking a bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My dear god.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They tasted like slime on the inside. Hard as rocks on the outside Was this supposed to be *chocolate*? There was no flavor that I could detect other than &#39;no&#39;. That was its flavor. *torment*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zuviel said his demon lords like them.&#34; She beamed innocently. &#34;They give them to the recovering souls, the ones they really like!&#34; She said this with a smile ear to ear</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/I threaten my Layer Lords with that one. Even my power cannot save you. Be *grateful* that I block your thoughts you little shit. / linked grandfather His link seemed to encompass my entire mind. If I tried to think a thought at that moment, I doubt I&#39;d have been able to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh my god. They smelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wretched a little, managing to hide that from her. How I got all 8 down, I think I blacked that part out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So good. Mm-mmmm-mmmmmm.&#34; I said with a smile. The frosting tasted like Hellfire Why did she add sulfur to the sugar?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Alpha, we need you./ Linked a Warrior. In the morning, they&#39;d have a payroll, but for now we documented who did patrol tonight on paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh! I&#39;m Saved!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/I&#39;LL BE RIGHT THERE!!!/ I said way more excitedly than I should have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/. The minotaur is back. And hunters are camping but we don&#39;t know what to do./ he linked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandmother, thank you for the meal. I need to go protect my people.&#34; I said being handed another plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take those to Zuzu.&#34; She beamed innocently. &#34;I knew essence of suffering was a good idea. Demons like that.&#34; She smiled. She waved and he shyly, fearfully waved back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really, I couldn&#39;t tell.&#34; I grinned. He did this He HAS to tell her. I won&#39;t. Her innocent eyes broken would haunt my dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I handed those to grandfather. The look on his horrified face.the *regret* . Her skill put fear into the god who ruled half all there was and when I got into the forest I vomited as I shifted.</p>
