                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t follow how fast they were, just the red, and darker red flashes of both the first son of Aris, and the last son of Bryson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Birrai&#39;shivaal Your seed with a *mortal* made this level of quality?&#34; He asked in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isabelle is my mate. There is no other love in my heart greater.&#34; He said simply. He held her closer, and I could see them exchange links. The other hand had Vexterios, while Asanguis held Aristaeus. He said nothing, and didn&#39;t pay attention to the fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to be fair. They are Really cute He let Ari sit on top of his head, and my little boy wagged his tail up there</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Son, of all the gods, you will find the Lord of Justice non-participatory in our horse shit.&#34; Chuckled Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not mean to offend. I forget you were raised below.&#34; Aris said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re fine. You did not insult.&#34; Said Bryson stiffly. &#34;Be careful with Ari.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I *Am*&#34; Asanguis complained. &#34;Isn&#39;t that right little one? One day I will teach you to fly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t have wings.&#34; Huffed Bryson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh. Well maybe if he has the magic then. Your blood makes me rather excited.&#34; Asanguis gave Ari to Isabelle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then have one.&#34; Said Aris as if it were so simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um I don&#39;t know.&#34; Asanguis slowly turned red. &#34;Serpents are born without childhoods at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it&#39;s still going to be your kid.&#34; Said Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me wonder. Were they planning on kids now? That would make waves in the supernatural world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll give them a childhood if it means that much.&#34; Said the Horned One. &#34;Nobody ever asks for what they want.&#34; He huffed. &#34;The just *endure* for politeness, as if their father would punish them for a question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fucking tell me about it.&#34; Said Arviel. &#34;I have at least a trillion who suffer thinking I&#39;m going to say no to curing their ailments or whatever else have you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t even get me started. Apythmenos wore robes that gave him hives for so fucking long, being an idiot. I had to watch it *and* hear him bitch about it. Ugh.&#34; He rolled his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know how long Zumitas drowned at the bottom of the ocean...&#34; Arviel rolled his eyes too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Idiots.&#34; They both said shaking their head the same way at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The loud clang of Kaizen&#39;s bow smashing Rezair&#39;s shield. That I saw The shockwave was felt from up here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At any rateLady Lulliba, you have fine blood.&#34; Aris nodded his head. &#34;I would very much like your permission to take your bum son and turn him into a man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Horned One and Arviel chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have it.&#34; Said the Moon Goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*I&#39;ll* train my youngest brother, thank you.&#34; Said Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When?&#34; Asked Aris as if he were offended. &#34;You coddle him. Look at his son. Look at him Fucking Go!&#34; he stood. &#34;I want a turn!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fight me then.&#34; Said Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, and have to look for- regrow wings you fat, cheating bastard.&#34; Scoffed Aris</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could go for a rematch.&#34; Said Asanguis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gods, I took nothing!&#34; Xaxas laughed. &#34;You&#39;re fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Not. Look at me! My wings look like a bad taxidermy vulture.&#34; He laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas did too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did he lose? I wanted to know what he had to look for, and the Horned One patted my head with a chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is too entertaining for our own good. I almost stopped paying attention to my other tasks.&#34; Said the Horned One.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I stopped ages ago.&#34; Said Xaxas. &#34;I&#39;m still judging though. Well, kinda. The Line&#39;s backing up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xaxas!&#34; gasped Harmony. &#34;Do your job!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, they&#39;re fine!&#34; He complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean the dead are already dead.&#34; Said Asanguis. He had Vex now, so he could get a turn on his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Said Nixxia. He gave her my pup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t use him to shield you!&#34; me and Nixxia yelled at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow!&#34; Said the Moon Goddess in disbelief. &#34;Just Wow. What if they need you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, you&#39;re still paying attention?&#34; Asked the Lord of Light. &#34;My mortals are safe. I&#39;m still answering prayers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Horned One rocked one hand from side to side. So he was *Kind Of*. Or so/so. &#34;My children are resourceful.&#34; He said with a smile. I don&#39;t know if he was joking or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Husband!&#34; Chastised the Moon Goddess. He sank a bit in his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Husband you too!&#34; Shouted a tree bark skinned elf that had to be Lia. She looked kind of innocent and adorable, though legends of her make her out to be kind of a cruel, vindictive- NICE LADY.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Lia is a nice lady. There are no bad stories!*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got laughed at, while she pouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They all deserved for it pissing me off.&#34; She grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah, You&#39;re just a brat.&#34; Said Zuviel. He grinned at making her flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not a brat!&#34; she yelled defensively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are.&#34; Said Arviel. &#34;You&#39;re *my* brat.&#34; He petted her willow hair, and one of her vines lightly bopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry!&#34; I apologized, but I felt 2 feet tall with all the cackling from the Horned One. He laughed so hard he slapped his knee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, you owe me a gold piece.&#34; The Horned One teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crossed her arms and a gold coin appeared from nowhere. He gave it to me. &#34;You earned this. This is why I enjoy mortals. There&#39;s never a dull moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held the coin a tree was on one side, and her face was on the other I kind of wanted this for a necklace, and the next thing I knew, it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go Kaizen!&#34; Shouted Isabelle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go Rezair!&#34; shouted Aris. &#34;You know his mother is one of Posidion&#39;s daughters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Said Xaxas. &#34;That makes him eligible to be the new Leviathan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh. You&#39;re right. How&#39;s the ocean down there?&#34; Aris asked casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sour. I turn it around whenever I smell it, but I&#39;m all the way in Jentucky, so I catch it when it&#39;s terrible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I manage.&#34; Said Lia. &#34;I drink tea to aid my in purifying my blood, but you&#39;d be doing me a favor son.&#34; She smiled weakly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&#34; Asked Aris. &#34;You too father. I know we clash, but you should have said something too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wage, and monitor war on nearly every world now. You&#39;re busy.&#34; Lia admitted sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She made me swear not to.&#34; Said Arviel. &#34;I told her a closed mouth doesn&#39;t get fed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I told you that I wasn&#39;t hungry.&#34; Lia countered sassily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m never too busy for my mother&#34; Aris said shaking his head. &#34;Both of you are so stubborn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Servants with great trays of meat appeared. The food and wine was placed on little trays that floated midair. And I watched as best as I could, though I couldn&#39;t follow any of it. I don&#39;t think the others, even Isabelle, Nixxia, and Harmony could, but it honestly didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Kaizen-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were both sweaty and smelled of man, but he wouldn&#39;t give up. I wouldn&#39;t either. I wanted my mate to see that I was, in fact, at least *kinda* cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That and the boys. They&#39;ll remember this. I wanted them to be proud of their papa, little and distracted as they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ay! Pay attention!&#34; He yelled, though scales were on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rushed me, leaving a trail of water behind him. He lost his balance, surprised by his own actions, and tumbled across the ground to the edge of the arena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I&#39;ll be&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The arena filled with water, and I swam, seeing the leviathan before me. The great water dragon swam in a large circle, and hissed a language I don&#39;t know, nor could make out even the symbols.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough. There is a Draw!&#34; Shouted Aris. &#34;My son you did not win, so I will not make you Chaos, Wrath, or the one I&#39;ve been saving Hatred but I WILL give you honor You shall serve your grandfather, and bring honor to your mother. Be Rezair no longer. You are now Leviathan the Giant One.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rezair, or should I say Leviathan bowed his head. His scales were not precious metals and gems this time, like in the myths</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was struck by the magical lightning blessing from his father His scales looked like they were steel, titanium, or something else with the way they were blues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like what happens when you put a lighter to steel a shimmery blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He, and the water vanished, leaving me standing on dry ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you, noble wolf, You did not win, but you entertained me. You have earned a place in my arena whenever you wish, including training. Your swordsmanship is OK, but still shit.&#34; Aris grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bowed. &#34;I accept such an honor, and I thank you for the bath.&#34; I chuckled. &#34;I&#39;m sure my mate would have loved the stinky hug.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I imagine so.&#34; Aris Grinnned. &#34;come feast with us.&#34; He snapped his fingers, and a seat was made for me next to Willow. She hugged me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was so cool!&#34; She beamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t much.&#34; I tried playing it off, but I don&#39;t think I fooled anybody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh shush and be a bum like you wanted.&#34; Said the Horned One. &#34;Next is Aris and Asanguis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes and I am looking forward to this.&#34; Said Asanguis. &#34;Last time you defeated me completely, but now I am your equal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They really weren&#39;t. The lord of the Dead was higher than War, but they both teleported and shook wrists. I was excited to see him win. I heard he&#39;d got double in size since the last time I saw him, when he was still a cheated demigod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Originally, Lia was to make him from the Horned One&#39;s flesh, but she mixed blue clay in, which ruined his godhood. It wasn&#39;t until grandmother was freed, and adopted him that he gained the true form he was meant to have. Though he still has no arms and legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard she gave him two . *other* very long legs to apologize to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia spat out her water and I got laughed at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forgot about the fact that they can hear me as clearly as I hear Willow. I&#39;m an idiot.</p>
