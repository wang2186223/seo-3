                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wee!&#34; He said going faster. He dodged other cars as if they were in slow motion, but I didn&#39;t care. &#34;Come on!&#34; He said nudging me. &#34;Embrace it. Let loose!&#34; He laughed showing fangs. &#34;BE FREE!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m free!&#34; I said shaking my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Louder!&#34; He yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m FREE!&#34; I said rolling down the window so my hair flowed in the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the spirit!&#34; He growled. &#34;Woo!&#34; He ended it with a guttural howl it was deep, and soulful but it was also really cool</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WOO!&#34; I Screamed, grinning ear to ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowed down, but I knew both our hearts were racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You called me Kaizen I&#39;m happy.&#34; He beamed. &#34;I just thought of it, and I&#39;m glad it worked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me too Do you want to stop at a hotel or anything?&#34; I asked. He&#39;d been doing all the driving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;d rather not have to fight an entire pack of Rogues again So I figure I could try something more exclusive. There&#39;s a rest stop park off the road. Your phone is registered as supernatural, so here.&#34; He said reaching over, touching it with a clawed finger. It said &#39;searching&#39; before adding a rest stop off I-35, about 150 miles from Oklahomuh City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that?&#34; I asked, seeing the place was called &#34;Oklahomuh Hunting Grounds&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s exactly as it sounds.&#34; He said with a smile. &#34;Just deer though, humans are a protected species meaning I can&#39;t just say &#39;I&#39;m hungry, and go into someone&#39;s home, or in public places.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good to know.&#34; I said grabbing his hand, and proceeding to pretend to eat it. &#34;Nyam-nyam-nyam!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed, showing his fangs again. They were fully out now. &#34;That tickles. Stop.&#34; He complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assumed werewolves Were on the table.&#34; I grinned. He smelled like expensive cologne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You smell like&#34; He sniffed. &#34;Heat and oddly enough Willow trees.&#34; He said as if he were thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Heat Like how animals smell?&#34; I asked completely Mortified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup.&#34; He said popping the P. &#34;It&#39;s why I rolled the window down and why I have the full intention of having you ride me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slapped his arm. &#34;There will be no Riding.&#34; I hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awe but I thought you holding my horns while I gallop around would have been fun.&#34; He grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, ok Wait I take it back.&#34; I said shaking his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope.&#34; He popped the P again. &#34;Too late. You can Walk.&#34; He grinned Wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. &#34;Then I guess I&#39;ll go jump in a dragon&#39;s mouth.&#34; I said dramatically. &#34;It&#39;s not like I pay attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine you little shit.&#34; He said shaking his head, getting off the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all pine trees on the road it went from open sky and corn fields to forest. It was almost as if we went through a portal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Technically we did. Humans can&#39;t pass. To one Not riding with a supernatural, they see a dilapidated, broken bridge and warning signs.&#34; He said pulling into a parking spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked like a place time forgot the dark blue barked trees here were as big around as redwoods. How did they hide a place that looked like a redwood forest The single cabin looked more elegant than rustic too. There was graceful cursive of another language across the top of the large lodge. It looked as if it could hold two hundred people in their halls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What language is that?&#34; I asked as we walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elvish. They made a demi-realm, a kind of alternate reality that takes up physical space. Here they have their home, and a refuge for the Rogue, the debtor, and the fugitive all are welcome to visit, though only the elves may Stay.&#34; He said holding my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a little firmer than usual, as if he were afraid I&#39;d run away seeing wolves gallop, taking double takes at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He released his horns, and the smallest candle&#39;s flame flickered. He looked like a Greek statue pulling the handle, growing taller as he did so...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you get to see me be who I truly am.&#34; He said letting his red eyes glow I swear I could see a flash of red lightning pop off him too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would be lying if I said that that wasn&#39;t impressive</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Kaizen-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let the other Rogues know who I was without having to use violence. This place allowed for fights they even had a &#39;bring your own prey&#39; system, however I wanted to make that clear the She Wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good afternoon!&#34; Smiled an elf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nametag said &#39;Ahth&#39;Lillan&#39;, an old name. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she were an original caretaker. She had light blue hair, dark skin, and a bony figure, being as small as a mortal, though her bright pinkish, violet eyes would give her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good afternoon. Two guests please.&#34; I said handing her twelve hundred dollars across the counter. Six hundred was for the hunting grounds, the other six was for the hotel room. The room also gave access to the town. Wolves didn&#39;t like touching others, so I made sure not to. Yet I want to touch Willow. I want More than just her scent on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked doe eyed, innocent to that thought, and surprised at the price, but some were as much as a thousand a room and a thousand for the hunting grounds.. It was because they used their magic and resources to run this place, though they did have a village of their own walled off by an invisible barrier to the left. All who could enter that part had to pay an additional five hundred for admission to that and a night&#39;s stay. I figured that would be nice. It was why I paid so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave us two wristbands. &#34;The wristbands should NOT be taken off within Oak Village, or you Will be ejected magically out the sanctuary. It resists the changes of the shift, and all magical, as well as elemental damage. This especially goes for the lady, being mortal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, it&#39;ll let the others know you&#39;re here with me.&#34; I added to the warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will still have to pay for the pet deposit Lord Kaizen.&#34; She said tapping the sign with a grin and I growled. Willow held onto my arm, I think to try and calm me it kind of worked She didn&#39;t deserve to be treated like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is Not my pet.&#34; I said with crossed arms. I Know you see her mark.&#34; The second growl I made rattled their windows, as it was a low rumble of general displeasure and I was thankful that the mate bond prevented Willow from being nervous by it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately she was warming up to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh forgive me, well enjoy your stay with your mate&#34; She huffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will.&#34; Said Willow The feistiness was sexy, but I didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cupped her chin, and kissed her gently on the forehead. &#34;Come with me.&#34; I said as a half whisper. I tried being more tender. She was a Soft mortal I should be soft to her..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t leave your side.&#34; She said shyly, fumbling with her fingers I could feel the timidness from my actions, since neither of us were used to the sensations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take you outside.&#34; I said smiling like an idiot. Ahth&#39;Lillan looked jealous. It serves her right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took off my clothes, and handed them to her. I don&#39;t understand why Willow was so Amazed so was the elf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, my little mate&#39;s thoughts were so fast I couldn&#39;t interpret them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very good. Your room number is on your card. The elevator is behind you sir.&#34; She said with a frown, because she knew I&#39;d did this to let her see who she can Never have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear her thoughts, she was hoping that I would shift in front of the window, while Willow felt as embarrassed as she was excited for the &#39;pony ride&#39;. Both of them looked at my cock, which didn&#39;t bother me to be fair. well Willow anyway We can&#39;t shift with clothes; but I know for both their people, nudity wasn&#39;t common.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It also wasn&#39;t common to see a flaccid 12 inch cock either... Me and my brother were always the but-end of horse and centaur jokes. They were all light hearted though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my people it was normal at any time of day within the pack to just strip, shift, and run around with your friends, carry clothes in your mouth to head to school, and change when you got there, or even just skinny-dip in the lake. That&#39;s just how it was in deeply forested packs. I grew up so spoiled this is the longest I&#39;d Ever had to hide my true nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t understand me when I shift, but you should be able to hold on.&#34; I told her in front of the elf. I could hear her mind buzz with pure jealousy now. She was married, but she wanted a ride too. Hearing everyone all the time has its downsides. There&#39;s a difference between mates and spouses. She wasn&#39;t all the faithful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No wait hold on; do you have any bitless bridles?&#34; I asked, hiding my anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want her holding my horns pulling on them would probably be the fastest way to get. Excited. She wasn&#39;t ready for that yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes your majesty, here. They&#39;re complimentary. They also change to accommodate your  size.&#34; She said handing me the leather bridle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I strapped it on, putting it on the maximum leeway, and I put the reigns in her hand. She was beginning to piss me off, but I wouldn&#39;t let this ruin Willow&#39;s first time riding me. I knew it was something she Really Really wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No saddle?&#34; She joked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the door and shifted out of view of the little pervert, carefully making sure that it would fit around my snout. Willow looked Impressed, and I puffed my chest. I was nearly solid black, remaining the same height, just more intimidating. After all, a 7 and a half foot tall man was one thing, but a wolf that height was another altogether</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, compared to Even Grace, I was the leanest of the three. I believe the reason behind that though, was that I was also the only one who could make lightning crackle across my fur. My muscles could be seen through it. I shook my horns, letting the flame flicker. Was I showing off?. Yes but I bowed low to this small female, one that would be the first and Only being to ever get on my back</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The &#39;only&#39;... I let that roll around in my head a second</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feltlike. almost an affection for her when she sat atop me Beyond the mate bond. I was getting attached to her before the process was complete. I ran, not because of the realization, but because I Needed this. I needed this forest air in my lungs.</p>
