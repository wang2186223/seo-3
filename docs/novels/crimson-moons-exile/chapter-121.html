                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Oh my gods, Shut UP Little Creature!] Snarled Kaizen I didn&#39;t sleep hardly at all, nor him. I could understand the snappiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning came but there was chaos. We were woken by a trapped bird. It squawked I think it was a starling, as it *screamed* bloody murder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The bed&#39;s fine it&#39;s only the wall.&#34; I said trying to mentally make peace with the house being destroyed .. again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think Kaizen needs to learn Xaxas&#39;s magic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard that. I can&#39;t. What he does alters reality itself. Air becomes wood and stone, and glass is materialized from nothing. That kind of magic isn&#39;t permitted for mortals.&#34; He complained. &#34;And if I call him, he&#39;s going to probably say something like &#39;call a contractor&#39;.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True.&#34; I complained with him Gods the pups were angry this morning. They squeaked loudly at all the disturbance, as the bird still hadn&#39;t escaped despite the gaping hole it flew in to be in here in the first place!  &#34;Shoo!&#34; I growled, getting the bottles for the boys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You could see clear through the house Eternya had to have been outside, saw the flash of light, and did his dutyHerculian is a good guy but he is a little dense. If he did that to any of the trio, I&#39;m sure the reaction would have been the same with Tyson and Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He broke the window flying in here, and Eternya. Well At least the house didn&#39;t burn down</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The morning came quickly, but to be fair I had no real respite last night. The boom of the window breaking, Eternya&#39;s sword swinging, and the sudden breaking of the walls and windows made it hard to even think about closing my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully the boys slept some. Their schedules were off, but it&#39;ll work out and Kaizen if not for the chirping waking us up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If It Doesn&#39;t Shut Up, I&#39;m eating it.&#34; Growled Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t!&#34; I yelled, but he had the boys this time. His threat was empty with his hands full.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;ll take only One bite.&#34; He complained. &#34;Get out of here you little shit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried flapping my arms at it, and the bird flew out. The hole took up at least 8 feet of the wall. &#34;Gods damn it Eternya.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least I didn&#39;t fuck up the whole yard.&#34; He said coming up the stairs. His timing was good. He held his hand out, and the bird landed on his finger and bowed. &#34;Fly.&#34; He said letting it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The yard is toast, isn&#39;t it?&#34; Said Kaizen. He just sounded defeated. He wasn&#39;t even mad. We made our way to the office, and I put the milk in the microwave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Yeah. I finally got it out.&#34; He said rubbing the back of his neck. &#34;When I saw the flash Lord Kai-&#34; Eternya was cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did your job Flaming One. This house is replaceable, my wife and pups are not.&#34; My mate yawned. &#34;At least no one important is coming over for anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Goblin Lord.&#34; I reminded him. The milk was perfect now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awe shit.  I forgot about the nobles.&#34; The pups licked his face and he got Vex, while I gave Ari his bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think we should hold office at the security station until they fix all this&#34; I admitted. There was an office there a clean one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not a bad idea.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got the boys ready by wiping them down with a warm towel. They weren&#39;t dirty, and they went to the potty without any problem. I just threw on a dress with pockets and some sneakers. We went downstairs, and the ride wasn&#39;t that long, only 10 minutes with traffic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stuff that we needed was put in a box, and the boys could run around safely on the floor of the office at the intake, instead of worrying half to death that they put all that rubble in their mouths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to justify not wanting to work in the office.&#34; Kaizen chuckled. He pulled over, and when he parked, he got the heavy box and I had the boys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard about Lord Herculian.&#34; Said Sentinel shaking his head. &#34;You can use my office until your house is fixed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m waiting for the contractor to get back with us.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;So many walls were knocked out, I want to make sure it&#39;s safe to go back upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t even think of that!&#34; I yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He petted my head. &#34;Simmer down. I&#39;m sure we could bum off Flora, or Elinore. She&#39;s got a house too.&#34; He said thinking out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>----Kaizen-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The half angel&#39;s office  It was immaculate. There wasn&#39;t a paper out of place. Things were coded by color and name I almost felt out of place with my box of bullshit. It was my personal pc, since I still hadn&#39;t ordered a laptop from the MoonPack website, nor did I have my files organized. He cringed on seeing the box on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was my true height. I didn&#39;t feel like hiding myself today. Nobody should be *that* surprised by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you need me, I&#39;ll be with the humans. They wanted to learn cantrips, and I don&#39;t mind teaching them.&#34; Sentinel said honestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So long as they don&#39;t use that to escape, I don&#39;t care.&#34; I said truthfully. If they wanted a Church down there &#34;Say, could you request a priest? I figure if they want to worship their god, I have no issue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a good idea. We can use the library. Eskaal brought all his old academic material from his imprisonment. Let me call Rodrick. I bet he&#39;ll get a good candidate here by sundown.&#34; With that he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got the dreaded text Sixty Fucking Thousand Gods I may as well buy another house! I&#39;d already used homeowner&#39;s insurance too. What a headache. I didn&#39;t tell Willow. She knew it was expensive, but if she asks, I&#39;ll come clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a little time for everyone to figure out exactly what to do to patch the wall And the outer wall again At this rate the original house won&#39;t exist; it&#39;ll just be a mash of new patches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the boys playing on the floor, I got ready to meet with this noble. He&#39;s the new 4th seat for goblins. Before that, I believe he comes from the original line of goblins who ran Atlantis, their home country. It sank because they traded with humans, and it sent this world into the dark ages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Atlantis not blown up, flying cars would have been a thing, as I was told the technology was already invented, but they thought it best not to reintroduce it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came in Sentinel&#39;s office, wearing a suit An expensive one. I think he thought he was coming to meet a stuffy noble prince, not a casual Alpha in clean, but heavily stained clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We shook wrists, and he needed my box to sit above the angel&#39;s table. He was probably 3 feet tall He went to my thigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw the smoke. Sorry about your house blowing up.&#34; Mr. Porter said with a slight smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just glad everyone is alright. I can get more stuff.&#34; I told him, and he nodded, but I could tell he didn&#39;t get it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goblins were kind of like dragons in that regard. They have massive unimaginable amounts of wealth most times in physical form. For them, gold held a place in their heart about in the same spot as close family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get down to it. My cousin-in-law wanted me to give you a discount. 15 million; 800 acres. I think that&#39;s a deal if there ever was.&#34; Mr. Porter said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We did need that land All of it was undeveloped, which was also a plus. &#34;Does that include the connecting parcel?&#34; I asked. About 50 acres connected that parcel to my lands, well Wix&#39;s lands, but the houses being built were mine. I bought those plots for cheap, but this was damn near half my assets</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It does.&#34; He said showing me the marked land by a surveyor. It was in order. I sent it to my brother just in case. He literally has lawyers at his request, as they live in the castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My brother says that my counteroffer should be 10 and a wish.&#34; I said not sure if I could grant wishes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did a blessing last night; it was on the fly, but not impossible I remember that was what Asanguis used to buy his soulmate before he reached godhood But he was the Demigod of Death then</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know if I had a title like Herculian, the Demigod of Strength another example. I wondered did it make a difference, so out of curiosity, I offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; A wish from a child of the Horned One for my line of work that&#39;s worth the 5 million.&#34; He extended his hand, and we shook wrists. &#34;I wish I had 20 million dollars.&#34; He said with a cheeky grin</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A notification on my phone told me of the magical fucking withdrawal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You LITTLE SHIT!&#34; I got up and he *skedaddled*. He giggled as he did so, clicking his heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My pups chased him with me with their little tails up, but he used me needing to catch them to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you show your ass here again, I&#39;m gonna find out what goblin tastes like!&#34; I growled. His car was chased by Warriors, and Yuka managed to get his bumper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Ass!] Ari barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Ma Ass!] Vex did after him. They stood there in front of me when I put them down as if they were mighty wolves already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t stay mad. I picked them up and held them high in the air as grandpa Kaiden did me. [This one will be a Warrior!] I shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any who heard howled with me. I chuckled. Their father being cheated taught them a new word. Albeit a naughty one</p>
