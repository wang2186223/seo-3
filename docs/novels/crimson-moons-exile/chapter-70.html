                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The impact of his face hitting the ground made a satisfying boom, and I drew my bow. It crackled with buzzing lightning, and the sound of thunder rumbled when I let my arrow loose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was nailed in the ground with lightning so red it looked black, and I got him in the heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AH!&#34; He screamed, ripping it out, but I gave him no time to recover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I teleported to where he was, since he used his light powers to save himself. Zipping as light he tried to escape, but he was shot back by something wooden</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncle Jerold ran with Centaur at his left and right. He had only one arm and was missing his horns, but he snorted hot steam. He ran with a determined stomp. Nothing could stop the charge of the King of Halves</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ak-Arr!&#34; He shouted in his native tongue, and arrows bounced off Contradiction. Jerold held a club the size of a small tree, still fighting even though he was at a great distance and disadvantaged on the ground. &#34;El Ek mar Hak Eith, Ree Reth Rah-Tow!&#34; He shouted a threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what he said, but I knew my uncle well enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This again?!&#34; He yelled, teleporting to Jerold, but this time he dodged the same move that decapitated him last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerold hit him like a baseball, and he flew through the air unable to slow down as he spun. He teleported near the Unicorn King.  It was definitely an accident, since I believe he could nullify the powers of disorder and chaos that oozed from Contradiction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He neighed words that were responded too by Contradiction, and he shifted, holding Rodrick in one arm, and a white glowing sword in the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tossed Rodrick to me, and I caught him but we could only watch in awe as Uriel fought a 4-armed man with a single longsword.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi.&#34; He said sheepishly. &#34;Can I hire you to be my new steed?&#34; Rodrick joked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah, I&#39;m sure the Church wouldn&#39;t be too happy about it.&#34; I said shaking my head, putting him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of metal swords ringing as bells caught my attention. Uriel was fluid as liquid, holding a stern gaze with piercing ice blue eyes, and a sneer that told me he was so intent on this battle, that he saw nothing else</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Die.&#34; He said simply, striking him with a bolt of pure light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ground below became cracked dust before being covered with water again it was so hot the water boiled. The steam rose at least 40 feet in the air before it cooled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHAT IS THIS?!&#34; Contradiction screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The trivial blessing of my angered master.&#34; Said Uriel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why does it not turn to darkness?!&#34; He shouted confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That which is truly pure cannot be tainted.&#34; He said with a horse snort. &#34;Purify the water.&#34; Uriel commanded, looking at Rodrick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye old friend. Sorry to drag you into all this.&#34; He said sheepishly, becoming covered in robes like you see on the Holy Seat, though his big hat had a glowing halo around the top of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one hand was a big metal ball that had smoke coming out of it, and the other a large wet paintbrush that made the water smell holy Rodrick swung the chain on the smoke ball, and sprinkled water on my brother, who burned. &#34;Sorry.&#34; He mumbled</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holy water burns; that couldn&#39;t be helped. Tyson was too out of it to say anything either, but he did need to have his wound likely purified being so large.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get to see my kids.&#34; Uriel said swinging his sword, and a beam of light flowed with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The beam was so bright that being under it blinded me when it swooshed overhead. I don&#39;t think in battle I&#39;d ever been truly afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Hell I was surrounded by Grandfather&#39;s chosen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On Urth, I was usually the biggest thing in the forest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a Prince, none questioned my words but there was a silent awe to seeing the Unicorn King, the only man to ever last days in continuous battle with Uncle Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt so holy, that his aura burned me a bit just enough to warn me not to get closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amazing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know how Contradiction dodged it, but he held a cauterized arm I struck it with red lightning, and it exploded. When I caught the sword, I knew it was one of his brothers</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; Said Amphian.. He was a small white ball of light fuck</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll send him to his father.&#34; Said a female angel sweetly. &#34;Oh, forgive me, I am Titafia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Kaizen.&#34; I said surprised at her kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When did She get here?! My guard was up, yet I did not sense her until she said something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sounded like auditory candy It&#39;s hard to imagine someone who looked and sounded so sweet was in white shining armor with a sword on her side almost as long as her.  I doubt she could even land with that thing strapped on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; She said happily, reaching out, and I passed her the sword.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anytime.&#34; I said burning a bit as her hand grazed mine I kind of felt bad for some reason for Amphian. She apologized and flew off, but it was an honest accident. I held no grudge for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my focus back to the fight, shooting Contradiction in the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You Little Shit! Why did it not become sharp rubber?!&#34; He screamed. &#34;He&#39;s not pure!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was punched in the face by Uriel, and this time it was Aureus who had a turn. He raced through the air, leaving a small streak of light from the glint of his fan&#39;s blades.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angels came to watch as well, and Titafia flapped next to me again. I knew Uriel had children with a female angel His twin sons resided on the Realm King&#39;s private island. This had to be their mother She was light blue haired with white wings. Her hair went to her ankles, and her blue eyes matched the sky</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aureus&#39;s fan was basically a sword that could flap open, and the gust gave him more momentum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slit Contradiction&#39;s throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By order of My God, you are to Die.&#34; Said Uriel Icily. &#34;May his light hold the smallest taste of mercy, **for I will show this world but a Fraction of his might** .&#34; his sneer made us silent even the wind held no breezy audio</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck you!&#34; Contradiction screamed, getting desperate, trying to turn to slime to escape again, but he was slammed to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You slay my master&#39;s people. You bring Torment to his wife. I will not show mercy, for even his Brother has told me to have not a shred of compassion.&#34; Said Uriel. His eyes were fire. He began to charge an attack</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything went black for a moment, while the angels chanted a song I&#39;d heard before Something told me it was called Aurora.The very one that could sometimes be heard in holy places all its own each their own pastel yellow light like candles in the artificial darkness..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rodrick.&#34; Said Uriel like a commander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Light&#39;s Hands Bless you.&#34; Said Rodrick stoically. He tossed him something that glowed, emitting light himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha! I caught it.&#34; Said Contradiction happily, but I knew better. I landed to stand in the barrier of Diana, and the domed light of Rodrick. It was my instincts that took me there, along with the Dragon King and Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Light&#39;s Hands Smite.&#34; Said Uriel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t see anything, but I could feel the power that temporarily blinded me. The heat from the light obliterated Contradiction&#39;s Second arm to Dust while he screamed, still holding whatever it was that was pried from that hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He now had only two right hands, and one still held the torch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will burn this World Asunder!&#34; He shouted angrily, shooting white lightning at the horse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uriel dodged it with his blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He must lose his arms before he can be slain!&#34; I shouted, making my aim true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed to get faster as he fought Uriel, but I summoned everything I had for this one. I wouldn&#39;t miss I don&#39;t know how I knew that, but I did I could almost feel someone holding my arm as I drew it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me help.&#34; Said Areus, charging his fan I knew what he was trying to do, and I closed my eyes. His wind is from his mother, the Air Goddess Freeya, and it should rocket my arrow farther.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shoot this.&#34; Said Grace, putting her staff on top of the magic arrow I materialized, and it kind of fused together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Mine too.] Said Tyson. He summoned his sword that pulsed with his life force. It would shatter if he died, but he was stable enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father Below Give my aim truth, and my magic wonder to show this world your might.&#34; I said letting go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind it was pure darkness, and its outline was red lightning It made no sound as it hit him, launching him high above what few clouds were left. I got him in the back of the head, which knocked him out, and he fell from the sky slowly His magic of defying gravity was gone with the third arm, but the torch arm was last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body was burned and smoldering</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boom of thunder rumbled the water and split the earth when he landed slowly.. All the water was gone now and so was his torch holding arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since his arms had to be removed, he did not die but those who saw the might of us working together looked with genuine concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uriel landed, and he shook his glittering hair. &#34;Die.&#34; He said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He plunged his sword into the neck of Contradiction, and the blade was so hot, that it did not bleed. He held the head high in the air. And the angels bowed their heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We weep for the Sons of the Sun, but this world is his wife. Forgive us for the pain we bring you, Lady Lia.&#34; He said tossing the head to an angel. Someone else took his body, but they made sure to keep them separate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Black as well as white flowers grew, and cactus&#39;s made fruit instantly, radiating from Contradiction&#39;s dying place.for miles as far as the eye could see, the petals rained like a piano&#39;s tears in the slightest breeze but this time the wind whistled. The air was sweet and holy, but one could also smell the scent of Tarteron itself from my last arrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of us said anything, because we&#39;d never seen anything like that. The original Kings did... they lived it but as Uriel approached me, I could feel every fiber of my being cringe. He was a warrior only my Uncle could best..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why Xaxas murdered him so thoroughly, that he couldn&#39;t come back with the Champion&#39;s blessing It took the God of Judgment to slay him, a man made of literal purity.</p>
