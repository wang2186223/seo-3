                <p>A/N: Yall I didn&#39;t know that I didn&#39;t post this!!!!! I have had this ready since maybe last year! I&#39;ve been so busy trying to get the Bull&#39;s Beloved up! SORRY!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shamelessly enjoyed my ham sandwich. It was country ham-steak, chicken fried  It was juicier than elk, but savory like bacon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34; Asked Grandpa Kaiden. &#34;. And Why are you *slightly* wet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow won&#39;t let me take her Below.&#34; I grumbled. &#34;. and she used Flora&#39;s squirt bottle on me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandpa got a good laugh at my expense, but grandma looked stern. So I *did* fuck up. Damn it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harmony said something about some kind of ritual. I&#39;d be against that too.&#34; Glared grandma So they *knew* that much. &#34;Stop trying to pry too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her glares sting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It almost physically hurts to disappoint her, I swear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; Wolves saw me dip my head to the smallest wolf I&#39;ve ever met. Even Willow&#39;s fox form is bigger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Snooping is Tyson&#39;s thing. What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Asked grandpa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like the prying was curiosity. I know if y&#39;all talked to Harmony, you know where she is. I just wanted to try and make sure she&#39;s alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She only visited, but stop stalling dear.&#34; Said grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well.I honestly wanted to take Willlow on a date. The ritual stuff sounds fun, since I have a cabin Below out in the country .&#34; I huffed. &#34;This shit is hard grandma. I&#39;ve never had someone I cared about this much. I want her to feel special. That she isn&#39;t just, I don&#39;t know, some kind of pup factory. This was an event that likely won&#39;t happen again, and the cabin has a scenic view of the countryside Like There&#39;re crops and everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I understand now.&#34; Said grandpa. &#34;You&#39;re only the wolf, but you&#39;re fine son.&#34; He put a hand on my shoulder, and took the last bite of my ham! &#34;If you want her to feel special, just tell her. Take her on a date proper.&#34; He said with his mouth full. &#34;One Not in Hell!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Shit . Willow was human. You don&#39;t think she&#39;s mad at me for real, do you?&#34; I asked. &#34;I was just messin&#39; around, but I think she got honestly upset&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night she was pretty upset too. But this morning she played along with me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she was trying to make me feel better about it, when she&#39;s the one who needs consoling?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hope I didn&#39;t offend her, that she thought the sexy time was the Only part of that vacation. Once time slowed down again, I was going to arrange for us to have a nice, long get away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take her out to eat.&#34; Said grandma with a little understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I&#39;ll take her somewhere expensive, supernaturals only..&#34; I thought out loud</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere where she can Relax where she doesn&#39;t have to be stuffed in a human shape if she doesn&#39;t want to There&#39;s a Café like that in Bison, but I wanted something fancier</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xaxas never stops talking about The Epicurean.&#34; Said Uncle Connor, coming to greet me with a hearty slap on the back. &#34;Sup kid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey uncle. That&#39;s a Great Idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is, but you won&#39;t be able to buy admission with money. There&#39;s a 10 year waitlist.&#34; Connor warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. Willow&#39;s trainer owns that place They wanted to be added to the fold.and honestly, two more magic users would be good.&#34; I mumbled. They&#39;ll still live their lives, just answer to me if I ever summon them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t want her to think that my interest in Below is the *only* reason I want to hang out with her I don&#39;t even know what sparked this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll watch the pups.&#34; Grandpa shifted. He probably goes to my elbows. \[Follow.\] He barked and my pups got into a V Formation with Bagel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you teach them pack formation?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\[I never did. They were born like that. You were too.\] he chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes, trying to remember He was right. I was more of a soldier than I realized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks Grandpa. I think taking her on a date today will help her feel special. It&#39;s been Kids-kids-kids since they&#39;ve been born- Get Bagel&#39;s Paw OUT Of Your Mouth!&#34; I boomed at my boys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scared them so good they scrambled to grandma for safety, since they *knew* they were in trouble!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck I made some of the adults flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; I said sheepishly. That wasn&#39;t my intention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Sorry.&#34; Said my boys at the same time.Me and Tyson still do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We must be careful how we touch others no biting mortals, ok?&#34; I kneeled low, letting them look me in the eyes with So Much puppy appeasement, but I stood firm I tried imitating my father when I cut up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They understood my wording, and they put their paws on my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; &#39;Kay.&#34; They said looking guilty. Even Bagel learned the damn puppy pout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bet mom taught her that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck they&#39;re cute and I know all three of them know it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our conversation distracted both my boys, and Bagel, but I didn&#39;t want them to be too rough with their fire breath and needle teeth. It&#39;s instinct to be gentle, but they&#39;re still incredibly young. Bagel is Just a mortal, but they haven&#39;t played with her, or any true mortal roughly That&#39;s an accident waiting to happen if I&#39;m not careful as their father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The minute or so of &#39;stern&#39; face was pretty much over, and they already forgot they were being cheeky. I texted the Kitsune Lord, having to pay in blood for this date.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This place is so extravagant, money cannot buy you a seat, not if it&#39;s not years in advance. I must apologize and make this right. My mate&#39;s smile is worth any wish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\----Willow----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took the boys to their grandpa&#39;s house . They had a nice little playdate with Bagel, and we&#39;ll get them tomorrow But today we had a date.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, it was one that all the upper crust frothed for. I was complimented more for getting a table at The Epicurean than the multi-million dollar ring I wore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the rich, influential members of the pack were jealous once I said where we were going to The Rotted One, our temporary guardian, in passingKaizen promised me that it wasn&#39;t anywhere near the Paradice Island blessings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still felt guilty that we aren&#39;t going because of *me*. Yet I value that he respects my wishes. I bet that&#39;s what this is all about too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put on a short, sparkly black dress since my hair was so red. It&#39;s dull glow made the sequins shine Not quite a blood red, but these past few days I&#39;d become more fox colored, and my eyes become fox shaped when I&#39;m angry, excited, or nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Angry&#39; wasn&#39;t the right word, but I was upset Embarrassed. I don&#39;t Know!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..Trillions of people watched them have sex!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made the News!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were shots of ALL the Generals on HNN Down there!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Multiple realms talked about it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haven And Hell all talk about this stupid ritual that still has 5 days left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would DIE if everyone, *Everyone* saw me naked doing the deed with my mate!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get that there&#39;re *some things Xaxas won&#39;t get* being so important, but I don&#39;t want that to be ME!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know Harmony is going to HIDE forever! I would!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re cute when you&#39;re flustered little mate.&#34; Said Kaizen from behind, holding my shoulders gently, kissing my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We aren&#39;t going anywhere if you keep that up.&#34; I giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fangs grazed my skin Kaizen did this with controlled precision A hair more and he&#39;d bite my mark spot, and that sensation made me want him too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked good in such a formal suit, the crimson initialed cufflinks, black tie and dark cherry shirt  but I wanted to rip it off.. He kneaded my breasts, and I arched my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re even sexier when you&#39;re horny.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;Let&#39;s go before I rip that dress off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take me to my surprise before I let you.&#34; I giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.He&#39;d worked me up, and I knew my cheeks were as red as my hair. Now I knew why he was so frisky but before I could say anything about it, we were in I think Doobai.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a top floor, exclusive restaurant. I could see the desert stretch for miles, but below was a modern city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had to be at least a hundred stories up, in an elegant Michileen Star Restaurant, probably all Ten. Even though some of the patrons were shifted, I felt underdressed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see the individual weave-work of likely elvish tablecloths. The swirl pattern at the bottom was black, while the tablecloths were white. The floor was white marble, but there wasn&#39;t a single stain in sight Many of the staff had out bull horns, or satyr legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me wonder were they treated fairly, but their people are hard to read if they don&#39;t know someone. They don&#39;t trust others easily either, so if I asked I might not get a truthful answer. I also didn&#39;t want Kaizen to use his abilities. He even had his flames put away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many supernaturals were also in their suits, but in their true forms, even werewolves. They weren&#39;t in clothes, but there was a section dedicated for this. The ceiling was also at least 100 feet high to accommodate maybe a small dragon? There had to be at least a thousand feet of floorspace dedicated to such a large, ridiculous pocket realm</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this a pocket realm?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very perceptive. It&#39;s designed to fit a dragon lord.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cooks were in their true forms, with the head chef . Most were elves, or dwarves I&#39;d never seen those people before. Well, I have on TV,  however the head chef was a 6&#39;5 fox on two legs. He had nine tails, being pure black. Purple flame balls were around his head in an arch, while his mate was pure white, with normal fire above hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.so in the words of the family group chat, they were hot shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike Pergatory&#39;s Plate with Gabin Ramzy, the chefs were quiet. They chopped and fried or whatever in professional silence, with only the occasional announcement at normal speaking volume</p>
