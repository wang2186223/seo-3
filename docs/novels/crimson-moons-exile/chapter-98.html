                <p>A/N: I was wondering should I put Tyson&#39;s book here, or wait for an application and whatnot? It shouldn&#39;t take too long, but posting it here will be Faster but the trade off is that I would have to rewind quite a bit. AND Kaizen would no longer be the focus. I&#39;m leaning toward Tyson having his own</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boys&#39; were scooting now. They were only two weeks old, with their eyes still closed, but if you weren&#39;t looking, they&#39;d be in the hall, making a break for I think the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was where the milk was I made racecar noises as I scooped up my fat pup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see you.&#34; I smiled. I picked up Aristaeus, who squealed and wiggled to no end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was almost as if Vexterios knew he was next, but he was too slow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got you.&#34; I giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I twirled with them gently in my arms, and they seemed to like it. I kind of got caught by some of the Warriors they saw. I sheepishly waved cradling my pups There was a line outside the office, but I think it was because of who was inside. Kaizen was only a few steps away, but when I carried them to the office, he looked a little stern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha I wish to join.&#34; Said a werewolf. &#34;I know we will be safe here, but-&#34; Kaizen&#39;s stern gaze reminded me of Bryson, his true stature too His eyes were that strange black and red; it intimidated this new, potential pack member.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the while, his battle-scarred chest and loose ponytail draping down his right shoulder showed he was in peak condition. I had to get a special, almost throne for him to fit. The chair was made for supernaturals, while mine was just a black gaming chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Explain the murder of pack on your record.&#34; He said leaning back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen was his true height That was imposing for someone who didn&#39;t know him personally. My mate&#39;s strength could damn near be tasted. I might have triggered his hostility by being in here with a stranger. I wasn&#39;t anywhere near him, being at the threshold of the door. I was going to leave, but he reached over and pulled my chair next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something as simple as Kaizen holding the end of my seat showed his muscles. I paid no mind as best as I could people were watching. The best thing I could do was to act neutral. I held my little ones close, and I didn&#39;t hesitate. I was Luna. I showed any who saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked around behind his desk, and sat holding our babies. No one moved a single muscle. I think they knew if they did, he&#39;d kill them. I was casual about all this. I knew his hostility wasn&#39;t for me, and he&#39;d only do something if it was warranted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t some dumb beast lashing out at random people He was a General, one with honed skills and ample proof of his ability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see the screen of Kaizen&#39;s computer now. Mr. Oswald Mapmaker was from YellowMoon, a pack north of BeastMoon, his father&#39;s enormous pack. He was a 6&#39;2, stocky man with caramel skin and green eyes. His wolf&#39;s name was Target, and his status was one of a Border Warrior. He could be useful, but for Kaizen to interrogate him so firmly, something was up with his &#39;banished&#39; status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak up.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s not much to explain. I didn&#39;t like Warrior Torry, we&#39;d been feuding for 90 years. Petty junk, like stealing hours, or making sure I got border patrol on the busy nights. He did it one too many times. He paid some dirty Rogues to stab me in the middle of a turf fight. Who does that?! Alpha Ryan didn&#39;t want to hear it. He said I wasn&#39;t justified, because I was supposed to report him, not kill him outright after the fact.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It says the murder happened 3 days after. Plenty of time to report. I could understand if this was in the heat of the moment, but the report also says you broke into his home, and stabbed him 12 times in the chest in his sleep.&#34; Kaizen typed up the other file of the deceased Warrior too That sounded like he killed him out of hatred. There wasn&#39;t any harassment on file either</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t lie and say I&#39;m not guilty. Please give me a chance.&#34; Oswald begged. &#34;I can&#39;t go anywhere else, I&#39;m a Rogue now My mate doesn&#39;t deserve that. I&#39;ll leave her here if you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would not split up mates. The only thing it&#39;ll do is make you linger in the forest.&#34; Said Kaizen. The intense glare he gave made the man submit. I knew that look, he was reading his mind, and likely didn&#39;t like what he&#39;d heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were just a lower wolf tired of being treated poorly, but there&#39;s Old Ones and Angels on this land. Shadow Wolves, witches, half-dragons and such too. &#34; Kaizen scratched his chin. &#34;I cannot trust your words. What would you do to quell that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could drink your blood sir.&#34; Oswald bowed his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen&#39;s wicked grin looked almost demonic. The flame lit between his horns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There it is. *That&#39;s* what you really want, isn&#39;t it?&#34; Asked my mate. Kaizen interlaced his fingers, though his claws were at least as long as a damn soda can &#34;Do you want *power* little wolf? Power so you can *prove* you&#39;re no pushover?&#34; He asked this bluntly. &#34;You would give your freedom for something as trivial as being my underling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only if you deem that I&#39;m-&#34; Oswald was cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;Mr. Oswald, I have read you, and deemed you unworthy of Misfit. You hid it well, but I see your intentions. You wanted More than your station, and you thought killing pack would attain it. I cannot trust you. I will not have you make problems here. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please Alpha-&#34; He was cut off again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see your files And your heart. You do this everywhere you go. Jack.&#34; Barked Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes boss?&#34; Said Jack Directly behind that man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit!&#34; Mr. Oswald screamed. It was nice to see that for once he wasn&#39;t doing that to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give him a thirty-minute head start.If you live, tell the other Rogues that I do not allow All misfits entry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck you.&#34; He grumbled, and there were growls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen raised his hand. &#34;Make it 15. Starting.. *now*. Go shoo.&#34; He waved his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifted and ran down the stairs, and Jack sat now in front of Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, why didn&#39;t you keep that one? He was a Warrior.&#34; Asked Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, one who thinks he&#39;s justified to kill pack because he was crossed. That murder was premeditated. Planned. Had he obeyed the law, the Warrior that harassed him would likely have been reprimanded or banished. Yet, I find no reports regarding that particular Warrior. It doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s innocent, but I have kids. Too many people have little ones running around for unaccounted, unstable wolves. What&#39;s to say that he does it again? I&#39;ll call Alpha Ryan myself. You can never be too sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dismissed Jack, and I think this was the second time I&#39;d ever seen his black wolf. He was like a living shadow. His eyes were a deep purplish red, and he left out the office by phasing through the wall... I think he did that to show off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s developing well.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;Good morning beautiful.&#34; He smiled, kissing me on the head. The Warriors who remained in the hall smiled, or chuckled. I enjoyed the warm tingle of his touch</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning.&#34; I smiled. I made Aristaeus wave by taking his little paw and waving</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m supposed to be Alpha right now.&#34; He complained. It didn&#39;t stop him from putting his pups on his chest. Their little feet were no bigger than maybe a dime. They were so impossibly tiny, and thankfully their little claws didn&#39;t scratch him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha. There&#39;s another who wishes your mercy.&#34; Said Yuka. He was in a Warrior&#39;s uniform, so I guess that he chose to serve, even though he was rich enough that he didn&#39;t have to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next person that came in was another man no older than 30, but this one was pretty ragged. He was pale as me, and shorter than the average werewolf, but not by much. His hair was spiked and brown, while his eyes were a dull greenish-brown. His scent told me that he was an Omega, and the sealed letter in his hand looked important The seal on it was a wolf breathing fire, the royal crest. He also smelled a little of motor oil, but it could have been that his car broke down at some point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only wish passage. My car broke down about 10 miles before MisfitMoon popped up on the map. I knew when I saw Alpha Charred as the leader, it was safe.&#34;  Said the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eric why are you so formal? It&#39;s weird...&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;What brings you from Jentucky? This is Eric, my aunt Shelly&#39;s mate. Shelly is my grandpa Kaiden&#39;s older sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d remember me.&#34; Eric admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nonsense! How could I forget you? I remember the *bribes* of meat whenever we visited.&#34; Kaizen smiled. &#34;I also remember you were the only one who&#39;d let us chase squirrels.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They were *gifts*!&#34; Eric protested with a light chuckle. Kaizen handed him our babies, and that was when I think I mentally relaxed. He wouldn&#39;t do that if he wasn&#39;t sure &#34;They look so much like you. Vexterios and Aristaeus, right?&#34; he mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They still slept, and hummed lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, it was a little harder to name our first born.&#34; I smiled. He handed them to me. They still slept soundly, and I was grateful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nice to meet you too Willow.&#34; We shook wrists. &#34;I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t name Aristaeus Sinister, another word for &#39;left&#39; in Latin, the root of wolfspeach. Interesting how in almost every language, &#39;left&#39; is almost a play on &#39;bad&#39; or &#39;evil&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never thought of that. I just wanted them to have Good names. One day they will work with their father, even kings too.. I doubt &#39;cuddles and fluffy&#39; would sit well.&#34; I joked, getting a good giggles out of them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak your troubles neighbor. Grandfather would not send you on a mission to the castle for no reason. Leave us.&#34; He commanded the Warriors, and they closed the door behind themselves.</p>
