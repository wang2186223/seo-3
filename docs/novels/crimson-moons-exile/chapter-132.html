                <p>chapters I&#39;m throwing down. His first surgery is supposed to be at 6am to fix the port and stent, and I think July 9th is surgery 2 of many</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This scroll was unlike any I&#39;d ever seen. Half was white with gold writing, the other was the usual black paper with red. Neat. I&#39;m surprised the paper didn&#39;t blow the fuck up since their powers are so opposing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see why Arviel was done with this world. The scroll showed me in the form of a vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world felt. Sinister.. The air was stale as week old breadThick with smog, demonic energy, and sulfur spewed out as a strange mix of red and yellow out the roof of every building..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wrong Off Yet for some reason It made me hunger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This place reeked The entire planet stunk specifically of defiled purity They sullied and corrupted their world it was long dead. No gods came to intercept. They&#39;d heard Xaxas, and I believe they trembled in their realms, because after today.. Their energy will be my father&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people tapped into powers that they did not understand, nor could control *and of Course it&#39;s demonic in nature. *</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got rich off the energy they generated, but at the cost of their morality. Every generation that used the technology they invented, the more corrupt the world became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The technology they coveted turned on them, as it became possessed by the increasing amounts of Hell channeled energies they summoned. Even knowing that it was the source of all their problems, they didn&#39;t stop their greedThey could not handle the negative forces that were never meant to flood their world, but no one tried stopping it, even when it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when their children began being born with additional eyes or limbs Even when those mutated turned on the normal, healthy people. Those babies once old enough to try would kill their families, and lay ruin to the land They did that by creating more contraptions, or aided in summoning more of Hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They drown in the extasy of power they can&#39;t even control Of course, I know at least a few will be good, but they&#39;ll end up as father&#39;s food. That was woven into this scroll, so that was always the plan by both parties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There are no supernaturals, but there&#39;s definitely going to be a malevolent presence there. One that will kneel to me, but still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell it might even help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to do this.&#34; Said father, breaking me from seeing more. I know father He doesn&#39;t want to do this, but he&#39;d sacrifice himself to keep us out of the gods&#39; affairs. I respected that, but I did want to do this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already said I would. Grace cares for her babe, and Tyson is going to work the other half of the planet. For the Glory of the Night Court. This is my duty.&#34; I said standing proudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All except father seemed satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I will allow you to be the man you wish to become.&#34; He said putting his hands on my shoulders. &#34;So long as this is *your* choice, I don&#39;t care. We of the Night Court respect autonomy.&#34; He said this firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My relatives also agreed with him by nodding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34; Said Xaxas. &#34;The planet&#39;s only 11 billion. That should take no longer than. 30 minutes with both of you working on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be back before Typhinn Vs Zueus. This should be interesting.&#34; Said the Horned One.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zueus is going to cheat like the last one of his damn kids.&#34; Said Xaxas, pointing with a thumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey I don&#39;t control them. I let them be free.&#34; Said Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, free to be a pain in the ass. Let&#39;s Go.&#34; Xaxas snapped his fingers, a little annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were Fucking Free Falling!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is your fault.&#34; Xaxas huffed. He cleared his throat. &#34;Mortals, you have offended your god. I, Xaxas, First Prince of Hell have Come with the Third, and Two Generals, Death, and Decay. Domination is not present. You Will Rot, Lament, and Die for your gluttonous ways!&#34; He roared. &#34;Do not pray; you had your chances!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did *I* DO?!&#34; I complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You Moved during my teleport!&#34; Xaxas roared. &#34;Use your lightning to fly, you little asshole!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HOW?!&#34; I yelled, falling to my death if not for me teleporting myself higher in the air before I hit the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;FIGURE IT OUT!&#34; He sang, then laughed. He sizzled through the sky, and snapped his fingers. Whatever continent was below us was gone. &#34;There, now you both only have two to deal with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was on fire It took him no effort to do that. Just the snap of his fingers and I could sense the endless sea of dark red souls zip north.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I guess we just start?&#34; I yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the idea kiddo. Bryson&#39;s at the north pole of this planet. All the energy is going to go to him, and they will become residents of his realm IF they don&#39;t have X&#39;s. Use your bow. I need to check Tyson. He should be done with this planet&#39;s Europe.&#34; He vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Teleporting around and seeing the planet was already in ruin that gave me a little comfort I wasn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t killing innocents. They all, even the little kids, had X&#39;s. Their souls were red. I could see it while shooting across the sky, but I still hadn&#39;t used my powers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their screams were a bit much Even though they deserved what they got, when I drew my bow, I did so with all my strength. There was no holding back. To do that would make them suffer I don&#39;t want that either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I figured out how to float as I charged my bow One red light appeared. Then another until there were 13. I assumed that meant that was as much as I could put into the one shot It took 13 seconds. Incredibly slow for a supernatural fight but perfect for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they were going to die anyway it may as well be from my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let loose my arrow, and watched an entire country explodeThere was no more continentWith that arrow followed a bolt of lightning, and anything that didn&#39;t burn rotted away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Holy shit.&#34; I said letting myself fall a bit. I watched it burn. I don&#39;t know if I was alright with how I felt</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indifferent This *is* my actual job after all I didn&#39;t feel *anything* I had a random thought about lunch</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could I be thinking about lunch?! If Willow asks I don&#39;t want to be honest about this, but I will. It isn&#39;t right that I lie to her, but fuck I KNOW she&#39;ll think I&#39;m a monster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What will she think of our children? They won&#39;t even be *able* to feel pain There will be *no* regret in their hearts And with me the only regret I had was that there were still another 2 continents here. This world had originally 4 continents. on this side, and 3 on the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ganada was what Xaxas destroyed, Amurika, I just got the continent of Canada. How I knew the names I didn&#39;t know, maybe the scroll did that. I had a general sense of what major stuff was where.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their machines kneeled as I killed them. Espanola fell It was shaped like Ausrailia. I could tell at some point the entire island was originally lush, but all that was there before I destroyed it where factories pumping the demonic energy directly from the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last continent, South Amerika, was the smallest, about half the size of my world&#39;s. They knew who we were or rather, the energy of this place refused to aid anyone in escaping the Judgment of the Realm King</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I landed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew I shouldn&#39;t, as everyone scrambled. Their flying cars would not budge, I had not destroyed anything here, yet their machines only worked if they could share the fate they held I felt like I had whiplash Yet I could not feel any magic here. I couldn&#39;t feel anything other than the dark energies that poisoned the cement under my feet Not a real tree in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This place was meant to be a lush savannah, yet gas-guzzling machines made to look *kind of* like trees, though instead of leaves, they belched thick oxygenated smoke. The air on this planet it is stale. There were no animals that I saw either. Fuck This world even without our appearance would have died anyway</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The breaking news was on holographic billboards. Tyson was already done He showed no mercy. This was the last continent. They saw my face on the screen, and many fled, but an even mix of 40 men and women kneeled at my feet, begging for mercy. I could hear them some were scientists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t take the men There are no females in my realm to offset Arviel&#39;s distaste in the human area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also had to be honest with myself. I should only get as many as I need. Young intact females, but they would have to be willing to agree to this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods I felt like a monster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should a full-blooded pair of mortals from this world happen, that child *won&#39;t* be blessed. They need to be half from this world, and half from the other</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were silent until a ginger stood Holy shit She looked *exactly* like Willow Her sniffles even sounded like her.I pet her head. &#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34; I asked.</p>
