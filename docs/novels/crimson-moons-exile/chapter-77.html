                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two days passed, but something was off with Kaizen... I couldn&#39;t put my finger on it, but as I slept in bed, I couldn&#39;t shake wanting to know. But to be fair, whatever terrible thing that happened probably shouldn&#39;t be prodded. If he wouldn&#39;t talk about it, it had to be awful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smell of cake wafted upstairs and woke me up fully. The alarm clock by the bed said 4am. But I mean, what was wrong with an early morning snack? I slowly creeped out of bed Kaizen was snoring, but it stopped abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go back to bed.&#34; Said Kaizen sleepily reaching for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d been up here since about 12:30. The trio returned at the same time, but they came back different Friday Kaizen didn&#39;t quite feel like the man I knew. He came back looking as if he&#39;d seen the horrors of the end or something. Maybe he did.?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know how I dodged his slightly clawed reach to get me to sleep, but I needed some air. I&#39;d tried since we went upstairs to lay in this bed, and settle down, but my mind ran in circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m getting some of whoever&#39;s cooking downstairs...&#34; I said seeing him relax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t leave the pack.&#34; He said going back to sleep Why would I do that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t.&#34; I said shaking my head, and he sighed happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left him to rest, and went downstairs. The Realm King spoke with someone who Had to be another general. He was shirtless, with a pair of eagle wings tattooed on his back, as well as the Scales of the Judge on his top left shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They said they accept the negotiation.&#34; Said the man. He bowed until Xaxas told him to rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Kenriel, I want you to accompany Tyson, with Samira as the priority. Should they be killed before giving birth, obviously the child won&#39;t be revived with them.&#34;  He said firmly. &#34;If you fail in your task, I will punish you until there is nothing left, soul and all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye sir.&#34; Kenriel said stiffly. He had faintly glowing white hair, looking almost like Herculian but he was pale as paper, with freckles like me He looked like an angel if not for the reddish tint to his orange eyes &#34;Is that her?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, that&#39;s Willow, Eternya&#39;s charge.&#34; He said looking at me sternly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bowed my head. He looked so serious, I figured he&#39;d want a King&#39;s greeting, rather than casual waving, but he shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re fine little niece.&#34; He smiled slightly. &#34;Come, share drink with me.&#34; He offered. &#34;I hope you like milk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I kind of just kept making cookies&#34; Said Flora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flora was also up it seemed, while her sons were more or less passed out on the couch. Her sons snored loudly, including Alavastros. The five of them made a herd, but I knew that wasn&#39;t what she worried about. She worried likely about their futures. She hid here for Ellio, and picked up the rest over time. It was only natural she cared about them like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She bribes me.&#34; He teleported to a chair in the kitchen. &#34;I do admit. It works, not that I&#39;d deploy them anyway, nor father.&#34; Xaxas said being served at the dining table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put a large tray in the center of the table, and Xaxas summoned a gallon of milk to go with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat across from him. &#34;Then I&#39;ll help you polish off such a large bribe.&#34; I said taking a sugar cookie she made quite a few, all different kinds as well at least 5 batches of 20, since one tray was still cooling on the counter and this had to be at least 80 cookies</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, maybe you can stop worrying about everything.&#34; He smiled 10 cookies were levitated to my plate, and he summoned a gallon of milk for me too like I could finish That much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We chowed down though. Warriors in passing also shared in the bounty while Flora still seemed stressed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a question.&#34; I asked while he contently chewed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My peace efforts have solidified that this world is now protected. You&#39;d think Arviel would have done that YEARS ago since this place is his wife.&#34; He said licking his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I have another question.&#34; I said seeing him look pretty neutral. I was worried at first that I was annoying him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen has been ranked High General. None are above him in father&#39;s army, except the Herald in Title. They have to grow into positions so grand He got to see me make an example of another solar system because of the squabbling.&#34; He said simply. &#34;It&#39;s why they looked so disturbed Why they speak so little of their last stent in hell. Do you have any more questions?&#34; he asked simply, getting another cookie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I said in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I left, I made an example of a solar system that had 3 planets filled with life. I sliced through all three with my blade. Now father and Arviel are busy processing 17 billion souls Early, and all at once.&#34; He said as if he were talking about the weather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But all those people&#34; I said looking at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.I felt terrible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you rather it everyone?&#34; Xaxas asked with a raised brow. &#34;Did you make any more frosted cookies?&#34; He asked this genuinely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sir.&#34; Said Flora. They weren&#39;t ready, but she started frosting the ones on the counter early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I have to destroy worlds to prove a point I will. I have no qualms about taking life. What irks me is that I had to settle a dispute for grown ass men. that my nephews and niece feel responsible is something I can&#39;t help. They will no matter what I say.&#34; He said this sipping some milk, being handed freshly baked, still piping hot frosted oatmeal raisin cookies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I I was just flabbergasted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all died on a whim. He didn&#39;t look like it took him any effort or anything There was no remorse or sorrow or hesitation</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the point.&#34; Said Xaxas. &#34;Those are mortal feelings. Those who sit above forgot I&#39;m down here for Harmony. An entire pantheon lay dying at their masters&#39; feet, and there&#39;s nothing either of them can do about it. There are souls who died in the instant destruction of their planets, billions confused and afraid. They will be busy for some time. I have attention on myself now But if it means there is peace, I will detonate another. One by one, world by world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; Asked Eternya. &#34;You look paler than usual.&#34; He reached for a cookie, and Flora slapped his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t take out the trash yet.&#34; She hissed. &#34;Sorry Willow I found out at the party, but don&#39;t look so distraught. There&#39;s nothing we can do about it, just hope our world doesn&#39;t&#39; suffer the same fate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It won&#39;t unless they&#39;re ready to lose their wives.&#34; Said Xaxas having another one</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood. This was too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not hungry anymore.&#34; I said going back upstairs, and getting in bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see you know.&#34; He said rolling over. Kaizen snatched me and held me tight, rubbing my mark in little circles with his thumb. &#34;There is nothing to do about it Willow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34; I said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the morning, we are to sign another addendum into the treaty. This world will officially be considered a sanctuary, thus, excluded from altercation.&#34; He said with a yawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that still didn&#39;t stop me from thinking about what his uncle said that with his sword he cut 3 worlds in half.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>----Kaizen----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sunny sky was half dim, with the Layer Lords as well as The High Angels present in my front yard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Between us stood Xaxas in his true form 12 feet tall, with a blazing crown between his horns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mortals watched inside their homes, fearful that this was it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow Finally passed out from running herself in circles about all this There was nothing to be done, and nothing to say other than condolences to those who died, and relief that it was no one we knew</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she slept, while she dreamed of her mother, and telling her about our pup I was living my title.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood before Uriel as a general now, not just a King&#39;s brother or nephew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I, Uriel, with all my titles, Vow on pure blood and purer intention that none shall lay a hand to smite. That we as angels and demons may war, but NOT on this world This is the first world to be claimed as a sanctuary for both parties. That my people will not start war unless it is the Horned who strike first. May Rodrick hold witness, and add another addendum to the Treaty of 1605.&#34; He bowed to Xaxas first, then to me. &#34;May it be seen by the Realm King that as a representative, and as a messenger, we of the Light honor a cease fire on Urth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bowed to him, and then to Rodrick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I, Kaizen, Also vow this. I vow with Horned Blood, that there is no war, unless the angels strike first. That none create tension purposefully, and that unless war is officially declared, that none make it.&#34; I said firmly. &#34;Of course, as creatures of opposing factions may duel and do battle, but it may not involve any who the Kings would be angered by. Those skirmishes on this realm end with the drawing a drop of blood, or surrender.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As the Realm King, I accept and acknowledge these terms. As the Judge I have my own addendum. Should any disobey, I will deliver you to the offended party myself before I kill this world. That you may have whatever horrors inflicted on you by the angered gods before they raze this universe into nonexistence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A giant scroll the width of a small car appeared, and it was sighed by me, Uriel, my siblings, Herculian, and a few others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So it was set. As a sanctuary, no fighting beyond duels were permitted. It meant Uriel could see his grandkids without worry of killing them later It meant I could rest easy with Tamriel and Sentinel living here and that they didn&#39;t have to worry about me.</p>
