                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left with a photo of my nephew holding Snow. One day he will be a strong, fearsome dragon. But for now, he was incredibly small, maybe 6 pounds if I had to guess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d put it on my desk, along with the ones I have of my kids. This was fun other than being reminded of the horrors of the Moon Goddess She doesn&#39;t know it but even the 300 foot behimoth demons are terrified of her cupcakes more than they are of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They are draconic in appearance with kind of the shape of a bull. Technically they are a mishmash of animals. They have the head of a dragon, and their black iron scales look like a crocodile&#39;s. They also have eagle&#39;s talons, and a stocky body like a bull, along with serrated bull&#39;s horns that are ribbed, like a ram&#39;s. Their dragon tail ends in a spiked club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These creatures are gigantic, designed to topple castles and melt the earth with lava breath</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some even have wings During the war they were sent to bring terror from on the ground and in the sky. Hajroomond, the largest of them, is about 2,000 feet tall, and holds a mortal visage of an old, 100 year old cloaked man while off duty even he trembles at the *mention* of her red velvet cake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to be fair if they upset her, they upset Hell&#39;s king.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless I did want to visit, but it was best that I didn&#39;t. I half expect my paternity leave would be brought into question if I went down there too much. I rather enjoy being able to dart around and do as I please. I was only gone about an hour anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ended up in the human area of town, though I was wondering could this actually be a viable place for them to live. They have Sentinel watching over them, so it scares the undead away. But the issue isn&#39;t husbandry or safety it&#39;s more of an ethical one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They broke the law as hunters, so I technically could do as I pleased with them, but should we find others, I don&#39;t want them to have a den of vipers underground.  Real hunters by now would have escaped and plotted revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw the leader of the hunters, Lt. Daniel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!&#34; He waved to flag me down. I didn&#39;t know if I was going to talk to him, since I could have asked Sentinel, but whatever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey. Any issues down here?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Other than the sausage fest, no.&#34; He joked. &#34;I do thank you though my men and me, we kind of knew the risks and gambled back then. If this is the best we get, then it isn&#39;t all that bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you mis your families, but they all live good lives.&#34; I pulled my phone out my back pocket, and found Jack&#39;s texts. Sending him, and ordering him to return without killing anyone, nor shedding blood was a purposeful challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you give me printouts of these? We don&#39;t have phones anymore.&#34; He complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. You all do me a service by being down here. As hunters, your lives are forfeit even by the Church&#39;s order. But the angels only reside here because of human habitation. The Realm King has ordered this world Sanctuary. It means that angels and demons are not to fight on this world, and Hunters are hunted by everyone Even the Lords of Light and Night agreed that their wives do not suffer.&#34; He looked at me in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow then we *really* fucked up&#34; He looked at the dirt. &#34;Well, we have beer and bbq night. We got room for one more.&#34; He said casually. &#34;Come join us and watch some WWF.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bet Ace wouldn&#39;t mind the break too. He&#39;s been working hard making sure all the new arrivals are good fits.&#34; I said thinking out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I helped everyone make peace with our situation I bet seeing these photos will help too.&#34; Said Daniel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They will. Everyone is safe.&#34; I said walking with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I texted Ace. I also Followed Daniel to their house. There were about 10 down here. 5 on either side of a street that was made. It took a lot of magic to get this done, but they likely didn&#39;t know that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I went into their home, I had to bend my head down to enter their doorway. This house was made for humans, not me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jake, get Kaizen a chair.&#34; Said Daniel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright boss.&#34; He said already drunk. He slurred his words. Jake originally was the defiant one I was glad to see that he came &#39;round.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We do this every weekend. It&#39;s fun. During the week, we keep the place up. The mini town down here is pleasant, and the unicorns are really nice.&#34; Said Dan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t trust anyone else.&#34; I said firmly. &#34;The fucked up part is that if you weren&#39;t imprisoned for hunting, I could have released you.&#34; I complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We heard about the law through Sentinel.&#34; Said Dan. &#34;What sucks most is that I know my kids by now hate me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They don&#39;t hate you.&#34; I said shaking my head. I kind of wanted to return them, but then I&#39;d still have to find more. The only humans who would be eligible are hunters. More competent ones</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Their mother has to work now. I was lucky enough to have a good job before this &#39;one last job&#39; you know My life insurance won&#39;t pay out-&#34; I cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on.&#34; I said pulling out my phone. &#34;Do you all have a popular insurance? I can have that arranged through Wix. And if he can&#39;t I can personally wire about a half million each to your families.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would you do that?&#34; Asked I believe his name was Tony. He was the one who argued with Jack back then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I can, and I want to.&#34; I said simply. &#34;Also I don&#39;t think it right that I literally made a town down here for you all, yet your families who have done nothing struggle.&#34; I also didn&#39;t admit that I didn&#39;t think too much of the repercussions of taking humans from their homes. These men were major breadwinners. Some of their wives and girlfriends had jobs of course, but taking away the other half of someone&#39;s income would hurt financially AND emotionally</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Willow------</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You better not fucking lose Eternya.&#34; Growled Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I WON&#39;T! GO LITTLE ONE!&#34; He screamed excitedly He was winning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living room was full, and bets were placed. Even the Realm King was here to witness this. The God of the Dead was here to reap the loser just in case. I would not lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not leaving from up here until I see someone eat a slice.&#34; Said the Herold of the Horned One. He was so powerful that he was only allowed to be on Urth for no longer than 3 hours a week, but he said he&#39;d waste all of it to see the face of the loser</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;GO Vex!&#34; I held a dollar bill in my hand while my boys wiggled to me. I flapped it around and the pack enjoyed Eternya&#39;s idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go Ari!&#34; yelled Eternya. &#34;My taste buds are riding on you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My little ones were put on the floor, and meant to wiggle across the living room carpet to me. If Vexterios &#39;won&#39;, Eternya and Xaxas had to try the cake delivered to us by Apythmenos., if Aristaeus won, he got the day off, and *I* had to do it with the Herald.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The &#39;red velvet&#39; cake was. was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a cake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The damn thing held an aura to it that activated my instincts. It *WASN&#39;T* food it was torture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t know what was happening, but I hoped this would end before my mate got home. I doubt he&#39;d appreciate our sons being used this way and I was too competitive to let this go. I was not going to eat that if I could help it Even Xaxas didn&#39;t want it. I&#39;ve seen that man eat a whole wrack of beef ribs in one go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They squeaked as they wiggled to me, but they also kind of just piled onto each other. I took pictures and Gilbert filmed it for me, but it wasn&#39;t enough. They were my boys. One day I&#39;ll show them this ridiculousness, and I know they&#39;ll probably get a good laugh out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Ari won. He bumped into my leg while his brother had hold of his tail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO!&#34; screamed the Herold. &#34;FUCK!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled my hair my little ones licked my hands when I picked them both up. &#34;Give me a slice!&#34; I said dramatically. &#34;I am a girl no longer. Today I am a Warrior!&#34; I stood like this was a cheesy anime. Everyone cheered, chanting &#39;eat it&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;May the gods have mercy, for the Slice of Suffering will not.&#34; Said Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a cake knife and sliced into it It rusted the metal. &#34;You *sure* you want this Willow?&#34; He asked. &#34;I don&#39;t think it counts as oath breaking if the thing isn&#39;t edible for mortals. Plus, Harmony would kill me if something happened to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agreed. Pass me the slice!&#34; I said dramatically. &#34;The Slice of Suffering!&#34; I said like a wrestler. I know it would be bad. But I put on a show for the pups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still think you cheated.&#34; Huffed Apythmenos. Both of us sat cross legged on the floor while the boys were in my lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t.&#34; Xaxas said firmly. &#34;No one interfered, now eat it!&#34; He laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I die, I&#39;m haunting you.&#34; He hissed. &#34;OH, that&#39;s AWFUL!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a bite and there was an explosion of flavor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flavor I don&#39;t think I&#39;d forget What was this? It was as nasty as the Moon Goddess was sweet and kind did she know? She has to. There&#39;s no way she doesn&#39;t know her food tastes like panda shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, that&#39;s an insult I&#39;ve never heard before.&#34; Said Xaxas with a laugh. &#34;Does it taste good widdle Willow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck you!&#34; I said taking another bite. &#34;AH! It&#39;s so bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were laughs and I was passed a beer. I didn&#39;t even taste it. My tongue was numb and my insides were angry. The Herold passed out. He literally keeled over on the floor and died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he alright?&#34; Asked Eternya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s being dramatic.&#34; Huffed Xaxas. &#34;Get up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to die so I can haunt you.&#34; He said with his eyes closed. &#34;That way I don&#39;t have to take another bite. I Quit. I resign. I forfeit. Reap Me,&#34; He complained. &#34;Excommunicate me. I refuse to worship a god so cruel.&#34; He shed tears. &#34;It&#39;s so bad I can&#39;t stop my body from doing this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it&#39;s demon repellant.&#34; I said chugging a second beer. I kind of tasted it. I lied only to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s god repellant.&#34; Said Xaxas taking the plate. &#34;How is something made with so much love, yet she thought behimoth stomach bile was a good addition?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;THERE&#39;S BASICALLY LITERAL SHIT IN THERE?!!! I QUIT! I FUCKING QUIT RIGHT NOW!&#34; He stomped on the ground. &#34;Get up here and eat this too! HOW Did you let me deliver this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d rather not.&#34; Said the Horned One. He wasn&#39;t up here just his voice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he did. &#34;Give me that. It can&#39;t taste-Oh my god.&#34; He spat it out. &#34;I have to talk to her. I have to. oh my god That&#39;s bile from one of my behimoths. How did she even *get* that *and* think that would go well in cake?! *She got me to exclaim myself as the mortals do*. I should give her a place in my army.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She toppled the Half King of All there is.&#34; Said Xaxas. &#34;Will you talk to her *now* before next time she uses vulture meat or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For the sake of the universe I must do this I feel unwell.&#34; The Horned One admitted. &#34;She made something that made *me* wretch.&#34; The Horned One laughed. &#34;Oh Willow you&#39;re green. I&#39;m so sorry.&#34; He waved his hand over me, and I held my hand over my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to give my pups to Xaxas so I could go throw up in the toilet, while Apythmenos used the tub.</p>
