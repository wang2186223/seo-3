                <p>chapters, however, I think the hunting was universal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I I drove around</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m a coward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know the difference between cowardice and courageousness?&#34; Said Gulteer casually. I shook my head &#34;Cowards run and keep running. Courageous men do what needs to be done despite their fears.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad used to say that I guess I needed to hear it.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am a father too&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have had manymany children by my mate.Unfortunately many were lost in the war, or some were disobedient, but I love them all the same.&#34; He was quiet a moment, and I let him get his thoughts out. Despite his appearance, I knew he was an old man.  &#34;I thank you. One of the things that I appreciate most about the master is that he values blood-ties. Ties made through battle ties made through service through pleasing him. One can *earn* this right He sees even a lowly High Priest as a child. I have never been mistreated, and I have never been forgotten, or pushed aside for another project.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started heading to the house</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;ve done nothing&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You birthed the very gifts who encouraged his eldest to Finally make godkin. It&#39;s what the master has wanted since the Realm King&#39;s return, yet he would never voice it, being King.&#34; Chuckled Gulteer. &#34;You know he saw you cry. He wanted me to come because many of the other generals and upper ranks, like Haru for example, have children, but not from a *mate* You, daughter of the Horned One, may come to me, and ask anything of me. I&#39;m never too busy, nor am I ever too far away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered me a peppermint hard candy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Such a soft heart filled with kindness I can see why your parents lament your passing so. Is that your father?&#34; He pointed at dad mowing the lawn</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom was reading a book with the curtains open holding my sister</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I don&#39;t talk to them they won&#39;t have to die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you&#39;ll never get closure, and you&#39;ll never be allowed to see them again not even when they die.&#34; He mumbled. &#34;I think it best tactically, to move them to Misfit Your presence here marks them. All it will take is a disgruntled reject Rogue wolf to kill them, a half angel or demon who wants to make a name for themselves. A witch looking to change gods a zealot who finds out his daughter is married to one of the Dukes of Demons. that one is closer than you think with a boss like Father Macky hmm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you know so much. We just met.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I&#39;ve seen your entire life story, from first memory until yesterday. I&#39;m the Hight Priest of your master. I have access to spells that would literally make your mind jelly if you knew they existed.&#34; He said getting out the car as Soon as I parked!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed more time!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was TOO FAST!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dad turned his head from the sound, not seeing Gulteer literally radiating darkness</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and dad looked older He had more gray in his hair, and mom did too Worrying about me, and mourning me aged them And  and.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t hear me either, not until they all say yes.&#34; Said Gulteer. &#34;What parent wouldn&#39;t mourn the loss of their child dear? You&#39;d have aged too if you were still human.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to watch.&#34; Said Asanguis. &#34;I won&#39;t let you shred them. You will kill them, and nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes master.&#34; He bowed his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, your family holds my direct protection. Should any figure it out without them talking, I will handle it myself.&#34; He hissed. &#34;I dare a mortal to lay hands on my niece&#39;s pets.&#34; They aren&#39;t my pets, but I&#39;ll take what I can get</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That glare could cut steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Asanguis.&#34; I said wiping my eyes. He looked at my old car I could see the garage was open... It was originally there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow?&#34; He said turning off the mower. &#34;WILLOW!&#34; he ran to the car, and mom&#39;s head snapped from her book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncle Clarence, dad&#39;s twin, ran too. He smoked, so he was about three inches shorter, though they are identical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still in priest clothes since it was Saturday It was noon. Saturday mornings he cleans the church for Sunday and gets the lesson plans I made printed and ready if anyone needs any..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t I couldn&#39;t look at them as I cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if they say no</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d done this awful thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care how you&#39;re here. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s another dream.&#34; Dad hugged me. &#34;I missed you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t real.&#34; Said mom, holding my sister. She was really cute, having half black hair, half white.one green eye on the white side, and the other was obsidian. Xaxas did that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Arviel.&#34; Added Asanguis. &#34;Sorry.&#34; I think he apologized to Arviel. He said his name, so he appeared. I tried to ignore them. Looking at them or talking to them is going to make me seem insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She can&#39;t respond, and I won&#39;t let them see me.&#34; Said the Lord of Light. &#34;You bring light to my mortals. You have my blessing to do whatever this is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gulteer bowed his head. &#34;She wishes merely to visit sire. As the High Priest of the Night Court, I am here to see this through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I&#39;m here to make sure if they die, they&#39;re taken to you. Father doesn&#39;t want them..&#34; Said Asanguis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I missed you too.&#34; I said being herded inside. Asanguis and Gulteer walked behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;..Willow what happened?&#34; Asked Uncle Clarence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here. Hold Angelica while I make us some tea.&#34; Mom put my little sister in my arms a human baby a normal, healthy one</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.But I know my family. They&#39;ll be shocked but I doubt they will judge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had an idea.</p>
