                <p>*Mature*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kneaded each breast as he slowly kissed his way down I knew what he was planning but I felt more aroused than usual. My core already burned with desire, and we hadn&#39;t really done anything yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to have my way with you.&#34; He hummed. He massaged my sides now, and it made me moan he chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen.&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm?&#34; He said dragging me to him roughly, and flipping me around so my hands were on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34; I couldn&#39;t even remember what it was I was going to say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t cum too fast.&#34; He said with a small growl to it He was so assertive There was no room to deny his instructions. Even that made me aroused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted my body, and held me by my legs while he was on his knees. And he licked my button. He snarled, putting his tongue inside me and I gasped. He swirled it around in circles, putting it between my folds and on my button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was rhythmic with them, and I gripped the sheets. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d Ever felt so wanting I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever been this wet. I could only moan with his actions All I could think about was what he was doing to me. In and out. Then up to my button, sliding between my folds and aggressively penetrating my entrance</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did this slowly, but there was force behind his tongue it made me want him inside me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah.&#34; I groaned arching my back. I was unable to do anything more than feel the pleasure he was giving me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled, getting off the bed so he could stand, and he dragged me with him. He did this like I weighed nothing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen inserted three fingers, ramming them into me while one hand held me in the air I could feel myself clamp around them as he had his way with me.I began to climb faster, gripping the sheets as hard as I could. He attacked every spot that gave pleasure. He licked my button while he fingered me with his large hands. It was pure bliss</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck me.&#34; I said with a wanting pant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you wish.&#34; He said, lowering me, but he held my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen thrust in his cock into me roughly. It was what sent me over the edge. I came so hard, that I pulsed while he used his strength to ram me. He did so with inhuman speed, having his fill. He almost pulled out, then pushed with what felt like all his might each explosion of pleasure made me climb again Each pound slapped him against me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god.&#34; I moaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re so fucking tight.&#34; He snarled. The smack of his impact could probably be heard downstairs I know his snarls could. I was no better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moaned when he went faster still, outright fucking me hard and fast. There was no gentle mating as he put it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snarled, flipping me around, and now his cock grazed my button with every motion. His eyes were strained, and his horns were out. He picked me up, and I wrapped my legs around his waist. I grabbed his horns, and a demonic snarl I&#39;d never heard before emitted from his throat it vibrated my hands, and he grew taller.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bit my mark, thrusting into me so hard that I came again. I didn&#39;t climb this time He marked me with a snarl, cumming, but not stopping. He roared, still going the same speed. He pounded into me like I was going to vanish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned over, putting me on the bed, still marking me, still mating me Sucking my neck He licked my mark, moving to my lips, and he kissed me. I could feel his fangs, and I could only strain my eyes closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like this was magic.. I wanted him to keep going like this Hell if we could stay like this all day, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d mind. I climbed the proverbial mountain with him. I felt almost depraved. I don&#39;t know How, but I wanted more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harder.&#34; I begged I&#39;d never felt so aroused  &#34;Fuck me as hard as you can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He obliged, grabbing my hips harder, and showing me he was a prince. I moaned more Each time he pounded into me, I grunted, getting tighter. I hung onto his horns as best as I could, while he had to lean forward a bit to accommodate the fact that I was short. His grip was iron, but I could tell he was trying his best not to go too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t get enough of you.&#34; He rasped He almost sounded like a different person, and his eyes were a deep red the whites of his eyes were gone, but I didn&#39;t care. I pulled his horns, and he bucked, cumming so hard I could feel it spill onto the sheets.. He pumped in me, taking me by the throat, with his thumb resting on my mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grunted and I came a third time It was the most intense of them I felt like I skydived off a mountain. And Kaizen was so big, that I could feel every inch as he pulled out He was still cumming thick ropes He came on my stomach too. And I was so tired all I could do was just let him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; He said sheepishly. He picked me up and went to the shower he barely fit in there, but I found myself still horny</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the water was hot, he got the sponge and washed me, yet his flagpole didn&#39;t lower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You smell almost like you&#39;re in heat.&#34; He grumbled. It felt good to have his touch I needed more, but he seemed almost innocent to the fact that I was more than Just smelling like I was in &#39;heat&#39;.  I debated on showing him, then I did. I grabbed his cock and pumped it slowly he was still hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you-&#34; He cut off his comment, moaning when I leaned down and licked it. I&#39;d never done this before, but I imitated what he did to my button. The only thing that fit in my mouth was his tip, and I swirled it around</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was depraved dirty but he was my husband I could tell he wasn&#39;t done, but thought I was. His cock tingled in my mouth. He put his hand on the top of my head, but I could see his muscles strain He was trying not to take me here and now</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to be a deviant I wanted to make him as depraved as I was I was so wet that I could feel the hot water take my wetness I was dripping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh baby do you want more?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to keep breeding me like a damn goat.&#34; I said seductively. I didn&#39;t know what I was saying, but he picked me up, and put himself in me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was pressed against the shower, and he put my legs above my head, resting them on his shoulders He leaned in and kissed me, this time going slow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gods.&#34; I shouted slow felt just as good as fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time his cock almost left a trail of arousal with it. This time he pulled it just shy of all the way out, and plunged into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a bad girl.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is torture.&#34; I said holding onto his wrists I was at his mercy I wanted him to ram into me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s meant to be. Your heat was not truly sated the first time It&#39;s come back because I didn&#39;t Fuck you like your body wanted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But we had safe sex&#34; I said as he inserted himself a little rougher I was so wet it slid in. He kissed me roughly, keeping his cock inside me, moving it around in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wore a condom and fucked you like a human Today you&#39;re being Bred.&#34; He said this as his true visage &#34;I&#39;m not going to stop until you Can&#39;t walk.&#34; He warned. &#34;That&#39;s what your body wants I can&#39;t leave my Luna wanting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rammed into me again I felt myself encase his cock so tightly, I thought I was about to go over the edge again, but I didn&#39;t I kept climbing higher and higher until I thought there was nowhere to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was damn near seeing stars</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally came like I wanted It was an explosion of sensation. I screamed his name,, bucking as I did so, and he had to hold me tightly while he finished. He held me like that until his cock became soft, sliding out on its own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Holy shit.&#34; I panted looking at him grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have *No* idea how much I&#39;ve wanted to do that.&#34; He smiled. He kissed me softly, having to hold me since he was so tall and I don&#39;t think I could stand if I wanted to anyway.</p>
