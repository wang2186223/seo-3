                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This shit made the base of my horns itch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe if it would have escalated, or there was a whistle blower in his office. Maybe a sympathetic Beta or years later his son killing him for his pack? Possibly something like that would reach my brother&#39;s ears, but that would be decades from now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you banishing me like Alpha Wisp?&#34; She asked quietly. She was bitter about this, anyone would be, but I wouldn&#39;t throw her on the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew of the Wisps. The patriarch of their family, Esmond Wisp is the Fourth Seat, though I knew one of his family took over SalmonMoon before I was born. Either way, both Alphas had mates, and kids She&#39;s already proven she was after the Luna spot. Her file, and her actions have blacklisted her. Most won&#39;t let her enter for fear of her disruption of she wolf hierarchy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I linked my mate. I let her know my decision before I&#39;d say it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I won&#39;t chastise you about it either, but I will let you live here with a warning. You did this for power not allotted to you If you make trouble here, you will lose more than your life, but other than that, welcome.&#34; I shooed her away. &#34;Warrior Yuka, get her a place to stay off the bottom shelf. You can stay in the Omega house, and here&#39;s the number for the clinic.&#34; I said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not an Omega.&#34; She complained. &#34;I was entitled to that position. I&#39;m the strong-&#34; I cut her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MisfitMoon does not care about your status, strength, or bloodline. You&#39;re here because you gambled on Alpha Green leaving his mark mate and you *lost*. You&#39;re not blacklisted by him putting your name in red lettering either. He has the events a little skewed in his favor, but it is the truth. There&#39;s no exile status on here.&#34; I turned the screen around.  &#34;He made your file like every other wolf Until the file on your charges appear, along with photos of texts, images of his safe and other things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at her crimes. They were legitimate. Each one had photo evidence The attempt/ plot of Mutiny and Usurp attempt of Luna Status, Luna Threatening, Slander, Theft of Property over $20,000 Stealing from an Alpha ranked officer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any Alpha, not just one with a mark mate, won&#39;t let you in if they have any respect for their Luna, or better yet peace of mind. This file screams drama maker. So, I feel like it would do you good to be somewhere quiet. The positions here are merit based, and officer&#39;s positions are filled... Rewards here are not for the strong, it&#39;s for those who make this place less shitty Also, I do think it&#39;s unfair that he could have gotten away with banishing you.&#34; He didn&#39;t on paper, but I know he wouldn&#39;t allow her in if she went back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There also isn&#39;t a such thing as child support or alimony with supernaturals There&#39;s still shame on women for not being virgins There&#39;s still a stigma that will mark her and her child as a bastard and her a harlot</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew BOTH Alpha Wisps were in their thousands. They probably didn&#39;t even indulge her rejection into their pack in person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scoffed in disbelief that I&#39;d put it so bluntly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take what you can get, and be grateful you even have a place. Be thankful he didn&#39;t issue a warrant  Back home I&#39;m sure his mark mate would want to make an example of you. But most of all, be thankful that I accepted you into Misfit. Any other Alpha would have let you birth that pup in a field somewhere.&#34; I growled at her disrespectful attitude. She bared her teeth at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I admit, I said this more harshly than I really wanted, but it got the point across.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d get help, but no sympathy here. This is the result of poor life choices. Had she come here from a lost mate or had Alpha Green taken advantage of her, of course I&#39;d have personally teleported to his front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was mutualShe was young, but not so young that she didn&#39;t understand what she did had risks. They both played adult games and won an adult prize. Her pup will be in a safe environment though  The job, should she take it, will pay enough for her to live comfortably. That I can fix I can help her financially.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I also wanted to passively let her know that her behavior won&#39;t be accepted. She carries a high nosed attitude, one that most will find unsavory. That&#39;s something I can&#39;t fix. If she tries anything to harass my she wolves, especially Willow, she probably won&#39;t breathe a breath longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ace, are the water tower people here yet?&#34; I shouted downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already texted Igor the address.&#34; He yelled. &#34;.Yeah.. Look at the estimate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>2 million. The pipe work involves advanced magic, and they wanted to be compensated for the large project. The town was double what it was, but I would spare no expense for water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus I knew the little shits saw my name, and thought to themselves that this Old One was loaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that I teleported.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I NEEDED a fucking BREAK.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m so sick of being Alpha! I&#39;m so sick of dealing with fucking morons who won&#39;t honor the goddess&#39;s wishes. It&#39;s frustrating to see the fallout from their actions. I don&#39;t know or care if he ever had his true mate The issue is that this is common. I&#39;ve also have to deal with a few Rogues who graffitied the entrance gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my magic, I went to the one person that I knew could help me out. The issue is that he has an office, but he&#39;s never in it. The fastest way to find my uncles, are to visit their realms. There&#39;s always a piece of them sitting on their thrones, even father now I think He doesn&#39;t talk much of his godhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You&#39;d think the Fourth strongest being in existence would flaunt it, or the Third, Uncle Xaxas But those bums just like to drink and be homebodies. I&#39;m one to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard that you little shit.&#34; Said Xaxas on his throne. His true stature does make him intimidating, but I ignored the hair bristling on my neck. &#34;Next time try my house.&#34; He snapped his fingers, and I was blinded by how bright Harmony keeps their condo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerold commissioned this high rise and renovated the neighborhood before Xaxas woke. They&#39;d lived here for decades, but the way it was so perfect, was that no one would ever notice that. The color choice was a neutral light gray, white, and blue for all the décor and furniture. He sat in the only thing that didn&#39;t match, a black leather recliner made for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His passive resting height was 7ft, but at home he was larger. The ceilings here were high to accommodate that, and the door to their patio was open, as Harmony grew houseplants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now what do you want?&#34; He asked forcing me to sit across from him with magic. I felt like a ragdoll with how much force he put into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did I interrupt?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, but I am annoyed.&#34; He grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He lost a dice game to Posidion.&#34; Shouted Harmony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I lost my fucking Jeep!&#34; He growled. &#34;What the fuck is he going to do with my car in the Fucking Ocean?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xaxas let it go.&#34; She huffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was *mine*&#34; He complained It was hard to imagine him being millions of years old He was born a god; but right now even shifted in his true form, it&#39;s hard to tell. He was too focused on complaining to hear me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could snap your fingers and make one!&#34; She laughed. &#34;You could buy another one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snorted steam. &#34;That&#39;s not the point;. Just whatever!&#34; he pulled his horns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think he told me that was the car he picked up Harmony .? It was his first or second car, so it was sentimental. I still have my SHIT Pontiac at my father&#39;s house if he didn&#39;t get rid of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It Was.&#34; He growled. &#34;That little metal box grew on me. I know what she likes He better not scuff her up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you liked it so much, you shouldn&#39;t have bet it.&#34; Harmony chastised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know but-&#34; He huffed as she gently cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop moping and help Kaizen. He didn&#39;t come for your sassy attitude.&#34; She giggled. I did with her. It pissed him off, but she was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever. Here.&#34; He tossed me keys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s this?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My southern island home.&#34; He said casually. &#34;I have no intention to, ever again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to!&#34; She complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way in hell.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;We were there a month. It was Amazing. Peaceful but we&#39;ll never return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34; I asked. He texted me the coordinates to see It was off the coast of southern Africa. Isolated I didn&#39;t like that he pried me, but I was grateful. The blue, two story house was on an island that looked lush and perfect. It was so far from the coast, that you couldn&#39;t see the mainland</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Island of Paradice is maintained by my servants. The problem is that. You know what. You&#39;ll see.&#34; He said cryptically. &#34;Just bring ice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why-&#34; I got cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was sent to my mate. Jack &#39;watched&#39; her while wrapped in a blanket, knocked out at my feet. He mumbled a &#39;welcome boss&#39; but didn&#39;t stir otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She happily sang The Wheels On the Bus to the pups while flying them around like little airplanes. They really liked the loops she did by gently holding them in the air, and this was precious. Why is she so damn cute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shined Her red hair glittered, and her smile reached her eyes I stood by the tree and watched her, as she was so preoccupied with this, that she didn&#39;t notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is what I saved this world for. I didn&#39;t give a fuck about the pantheon or whatever My home is Urth. Everything and everyone I want to be around is right here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wee!&#34; She giggled Jack was *asleep* so good that he didn&#39;t eve movie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow!&#34; I shouted like an Alpha just to be a little shit. She squealed, and we both laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m putting bells on all of you!&#34; She said making airplane noises. She handed them to me, and the pack got to see a 7&#39;5 demigod zoom his kids around. She rode my back by hopping on and I let it. Why not?</p>
