                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It really isn&#39;t.&#34; Said Eternya. &#34;We don&#39;t care about sex like mortals do. And The Moon Goddess was *Very* specific about us attending too for some reason.Oh, and when the reporters asked, I made sure to blur you dear. I don&#39;t mind if anyone sees my bits.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;I&#39;m sure at least a third of hell already has.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh stop.&#34; She giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It surprised me that Eternya didn&#39;t catch on. So I wouldn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was probably meant to be a surprise. So was my cousin on the front page</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. Harmony made Hell&#39;s news..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Hell York Times had the photo and headline in color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least they obscured Harmony&#39;s part of the photo with heavy censoring; she was asleep under a black satin blanket, but my Uncle sat but ass naked smoking a long pipe on the edge. He looked so casual about this too, waving his left hand to cast an enormous circle, but I can&#39;t read High Godspeach, only lower. Xaxas watched the rest of the entirety of hell get down with him, though his face looked bored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. And Why Was His Flaccid Cock Out? It&#39;s bad enough Tyson has ours flapping around on the internet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at the same time, who&#39;d heckle *him* for anything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know why they printed it in color, but I saw Eternya and Elinore, along with any other generals that had girlfriends or mates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s whatever. As the demons say, &#39;it&#39;s only flesh&#39;, but there&#39;s no sweeter flesh than the taste of one&#39;s mate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was entirely over the top. Typical Uncle Xaxas I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t pull this stunt on Urth too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh then humans on this world would have a breeding season I bet that could be interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t expect to see his new drakes and vampyr.&#34; I said referring to the island guardians on my uncle&#39;s island, bedding their mates. They protect the altar on Urth with Gulteer, the First Witch, and his familiar. Zeh&#39;Kahrraam, the First Demon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What were their names? Randy and Bandy? It doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;ll ask if I run into them. I handed them back the paper. At least this morning Willow&#39;s in a better mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How am I going to talk to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also, about half of hell is pregnant, since half are female So Eternya was right. But more importantly, jokes aside it isn&#39;t what she wants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wondered why so many were born when my boys were</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby Look!&#34; Pointed Eternya. &#34;Ah yeah that was our fourth go too, the one where you yanked my blood feathers out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted up his silken hair, and indeed there was a quarter sized bald spot there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OH-MY-GODS-SHUTUP!&#34; Elinore ran to the bathroom red as a tomato, and me and Eternya fist bumped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The master used primordial magic. You two need, no you Have to try it. It&#39;s still ringing through all hell&#34; He hummed, which ended with a satisfied growl. &#34;Kaizen you have to.&#34; He said looking me in the eyes, leaving out all the &#39;master&#39; shit</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d *never* agree to that!&#34; Complained Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be a stick in the mud my lady.&#34; Said Eternya. &#34;It&#39;s the vacation I&#39;m sure you both need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but I don&#39;t want to be On The NEWS!&#34; she yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to stop Eternya from actually agitating her, but he held his hand up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only suggest it because there&#39;s so much fun to be had.&#34; He said with a soft smile. &#34;Not only does All Hell watch, but we participate. Everything&#39;s on sale, everyone&#39;s in a good mood, well on Layer 1.&#34; Said Eternya. &#34;Isn&#39;t that right Elinore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SHUT UP!!!!&#34; She squealed from the bathroom. &#34;I&#39;m going back to the Judgment Realm!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My love, if you go down there, I&#39;m going to be bald.&#34; Laughed Eternya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can hide in your wing of the master&#39;s castle!&#34; She said as he went into the bathroom with her, and there were giggles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My personal room within the General&#39;s Chambers is at grandfather&#39;s castle, however I plan on taking my mate to our private cottage a nice, peaceful get away for us for like a month or two. Maybe three since time flows differently we could really have some time off</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We could go on the last day, and stay a while after I&#39;ll swing it by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I dare say that you&#39;ll even be having an entire clutch, not just a baby like mammals. Come on, let me fly you Below.&#34; He said that seductively. &#34;Let&#39;s make a sister for our first son hmm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One more time.&#34; She giggled. &#34;I Will Only Have One At A Time! And That&#39;s Final-Ooh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was giving me memories of Paradice Island.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could tell by the flaming whoosh of teleportation. And the lingering of full blown heat, that Eternya was about to have the best time of his fucking lif-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see your face Kaizen.&#34; She held a squirt bottle. The boys hid behind me; they hate water like I did as a pup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But *When* did she get that?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was labeled &#39;Flora&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Figures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put it down baby. I don&#39;t bite.&#34; I chuckled taking a single step. I accidently teleported two steps away from her.messing with her was fun. And I guess subconsciously I wanted to test the limit before she got me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay back! Stop Stop *That*!&#34; She yelled with a laugh, but how could I *not* gain a boner around my mate, who&#39;s starting to smell aroused It made me growl a little. She shook the squirt bottle as if it would stop me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rise in her arousal meant that I wasn&#39;t going to far. So I advanced a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can drop off the boys.&#34; I sang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook it again, grinning evilly. &#34;Last Warning Buddy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wouldn&#39;t. I know she won&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t you *Love* m-AH!&#34; I complained. She got me with water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Back! Back I say!&#34; She pelted the three of us while we ran. &#34;I Banish You Demon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Banished, I&#39;m Banished!&#34; I joked with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the boys with me, going to Grandpa Kaiden&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her &#39;banishing&#39; actually pushed me a LITTLE bit  I&#39;ll be sure to tell her trainer. It may be her ability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\[Papa! Pups!\] Yelled Bagel while he tossed a ball. Grandpa Kaiden was the kind of man to say &#39;we aren&#39;t getting a dog&#39; and actually not keep it but he loved *that* dog like his actual pup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sleeps in their bed and has her own *Labeled Chair* at the table. She does not eat dog food, and she does have wolfish manners, and has the intelligence of I Think a 4 year old? I&#39;m not here enough, and if I ask. Grandpa will show me all her photos again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You&#39;d think it&#39;s grandma that spoils my little &#39;auntie&#39;. It&#39;s grandpa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That little pup even has *Arviel&#39;s* favor it&#39;s almost not fair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing to indicate that she&#39;d died was a fur patch that was missing in the form of the Horned One, and a golden blond patch on her forehead before her lil&#39; nose stripe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to trade his own dog for her but they don&#39;t need to know that. A life was taken for the lives of the dogs on Urth because without that sacrifice *none* of them would have come back. It is because at the time of death, Humblon&#39;s focus was on Urth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gwran&#39;pa! Gwran&#39;ma!&#34; they squealed, running to their grandparents the Second their paws touched dirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, let me get the Fried H.A.M.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fried Ham?&#34; I asked I even wiggled my ears in my human form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit. I felt a little embarrassed about being *that* excited but Grandma Eclipse can cook! She learned from Nancy, this pack&#39;s Clementine</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clemintine works in Tyson&#39;s kitchens, though through our stomachs, even the Horned One poses as the family doctor as an excuse for a taste  She cooks with love, something we can savor.  I can&#39;t describe what passion or love tastes like emotions the flavors of those are akin to MSG. Hamburger Royalty just *Wouldn&#39;t* taste the Same without it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Made with love.&#34; Said grandma..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Umami, savory, or sweet emotions... good ones enhance flavors. I could taste that with her food. It made that ham, even cold, taste like  fresh bacon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom&#39;s like that at Dad&#39;s pack. She learned from the best: Gabby, Libby&#39;s mother taught mom With grandma AND Nancy, uncle Connor&#39;s mate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I thought about my pack honestly probably either Willow, Flora, or Chelsea would &#39;win&#39;. Chelsea makes bacon wrapped croissants from scratch, being from France. I&#39;d say baking or pasta is Flora&#39;s best, meat dishes would be Willow&#39;s, and breads, and soups are Chelsea&#39;s. That&#39;s fair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seems like every pack has at least one person who can really make good food but some of them have been cooking since before the 1605 Treaty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HAM!&#34; yelled the boys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see their souls It reminded me of Tyson and myself, but because of my wish, they won&#39;t have to go through what I did. The littermate bond forged, but it was made brittle enough to brake when they receive their mates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked a little harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vex and Ari&#39;s litter bond was strong that&#39;s * very good*. Once the sibling bonds break, they will still be close, but not connected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By our blood-ties, the Horned Wolves serve I could not imagine a world where I sided with the light or something</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe if Arviel got his hands on Willow. Maybe if my claws were forced, but as it stood I remembered being here. We lived here even for a time. The old country home had to be 6 or even 700 years old, since it was commissioned by my great grandfather Kejh&#39;Kaizo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And being the only living family member to have met him besides grandpa&#39;s generation, I can rightly say of all of us If not for Tyson, he would be a mighty king.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, most of the best leaders are capable ones who Don&#39;t Want the power, just to help their people.</p>
