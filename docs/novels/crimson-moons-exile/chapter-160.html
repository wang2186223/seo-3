                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They looked. Pretty shocked. They were being thrown into this like I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>:Oh by the way, everything you know is a half lie, and supernatural creatures and Roman gods just walk around and have demigods *everywhere.* Don&#39;t sneeze, you&#39;ll run into a love child of Arviel.;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought this sarcastically, and Gulteer snorted a laugh. Asanguis remained professional. And honestly, I&#39;m sure a goat horned, red eyed snake man that&#39;s 11 feet tall is pretty scary. He sat cross legged on the floor, relaxing his small form and visage to be true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re *Asanguis?*&#34; asked my uncle. &#34;Her husband is Death&#39;s nephew?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked them more to himself than Asanguis, but he did smile a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; He said with reptilian eyes. He was in his full outfit, scythe included It couldn&#39;t be denied that he&#39;s sculpted on the walls, and in paintings. Anywhere you could imagine imagery for hell. Xaxas standing on Asanguis&#39;s nose, or Asanguis in mortal form is standing in front of them. So I could get the double-take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And again, I am the High Priest of the Night Court. Drink of my blood, and you will become a witch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is unauthorized; you will make trouble with father and Arviel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only offer my lord.&#34; Bowed Gulteer. Asanguis sighed. That was enough to make Gulteer bow a little lower before rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He already said he didn&#39;t *want* to give up *more* of this bloodline.&#34; Hissed Asanguis. &#34;Sorry.&#34; He summoned a purple Alligatoraid. &#34;Your house&#39;s holy protection is making my throat dry.&#34; He complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow *what* did you get into?!&#34; Dad asked with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you it was weird!&#34; I yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m only here to ensure my father&#39;s High Priest brings you no harm.&#34; Said Asanguis casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would have culled them painlessly! I wouldn&#39;t spark the little master&#39;s wrath!&#34; Gulteer complained. &#34;Plus if he&#39;s anything like lord Tyson, I&#39;ll *kindly* pass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both snorted a laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Little Uriel.&#34; Giggled Asanguis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HA! Master that&#39;s *really-Really mean.* I&#39;m telling the master.&#34; He said like a little kid about to tattle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just came up with that one too. I&#39;m texting Bryson.&#34; Asanguis excitedly did so, and there was a message back. &#34;He&#39;s mad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But the youngest master is *always* mad.&#34; Complained Gulteer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what makes it funny.&#34; Said Asanguis with a light smile. &#34;I only do it for the giggles, as you mortals say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Tyson just a stick in the mud All The Time?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s a boulder in a trench.&#34; Said Gulteer with a light smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn I&#39;m using that one too.&#34; Said Asanguis. &#34;And I thought &#39;The Great Zealot&#39; was bad&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or &#39;The Mighty Jackass&#39;.&#34; Chuckled Gulteer. &#34;Lady Grace&#39;s words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Figures.&#34; Me and Asanguis said at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s Tyson?&#34; Asked mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My husband&#39;s identical twin.&#34; I beamed. &#34;Tyson he&#39;s really a stickler for rules because he&#39;s the King of Shifters, but Kaizen is a prince.&#34; I say as if that&#39;s something normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three looked at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. conditions are met.&#34; Said Xaxas Directly behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all screamed except Asanguis and Gulteer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas revealed himself. He was so large he had to sit on the floor cross legged in the living room next to Asanguis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Xaxas, Eldest Son of the Horned One.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Now they looked Extra concerned.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s also Kaizen&#39;s uncle.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HOW MANY KIDS DOES THE HORNED ONE HAVE?&#34; Screamed Clarence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three.&#34; Said Xaxas grinning. &#34;Damn, wait &#39;til they find out all of us have kids too.&#34; He snickered. &#34;It used to be just me, now father has 3 children, and 9 grandchildren.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They won&#39;t know about Bryson.&#34; Said Asanguis. &#34;Brother you miss this.&#34; He reached out, and pulled Bryson out from nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the Fuck?! Why are her parents here,? Willow what are these bums up to?&#34; He asked with crossed arms. &#34;Do you need me to make them leave?&#34; He hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t even *DO* nothing!&#34; Yelled Xaxas like a little kid, and I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah yeah, you Will.&#34; He complained. &#34;I&#39;m Bryson, Lord of Justice.&#34; He shook my father&#39;s wrist. &#34;I&#39;m the one responsible for the group dreams.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assume then that this was never going to happen.&#34; Said dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No; you wished for this didn&#39;t you?&#34; Said Bryson to be fair he feels like dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did.&#34; I said honestly, while my uncle still trying to wrap his head around all this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Who Wouldn&#39;t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were having a normal day, and their dead kid comes back from the grave with gods and the Witch King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh ok, we&#39;re just summoning gods now like Pickamon. &#34; Mumbled Uncle Clarance, and he got a chortle out of the God of Judgment. &#34;Like there goes the planet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awe man, I *just* got caught up with Two Pieces.&#34; I said sarcastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did my parents look at Clarance like *he* could stop the Realm King singlehandedly?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck do you expect *me* to do?!&#34; my uncle motioned Xaxas. &#34;We&#39;re *fucked*.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean no harm mortal.&#34; He said holding a laugh by putting his fist to his lips. &#34;She&#39;s my niece; I&#39;ll not lay claws on her blood, provided that you don&#39;t blab.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.So do I need my holy water?&#34; Uncle Clarance fumbled in his robes and Xaxas rolled his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not a ride you&#39;re tall enough for. Sit down.&#34; Xaxas waggled a finger, and my uncle was seated with magic... &#34;I get it, I get it. I *am* the villain mortals paint on your walls and I *have* *allegedly* destroyed the realm.&#34; He said that as a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Allegedly?&#34; Said Bryson with a raised brow. &#34;You&#39;ve cursed people for not grilling your grilled cheese long enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You Said you Wouldn&#39;t Snitch!&#34; He hissed. &#34; and I replaced their stupid teeth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh-huh *allegedly* young master.&#34; Giggled Gulteer. &#34;I&#39;m using that the first chance I get.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s your right as a Sovereign Citizen.&#34; Chimed in Asanguis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha, so I&#39;m above the law now? Let me go on ahead and crank my broom&#39;s speed to 850mph.&#34; He giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh stop.&#34; I giggled. &#34;It can&#39;t go *that* fast! They max out at 250!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I only knew that from Elinore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to break the sound barrier while playing the loudest song I can find.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We four snickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see why I have pardoned this world.&#34; He said that part seriously. &#34;This world pleases me too much to part with it. Through the protection of Sanctuary, the protection of the Night Court, AND the permission from the Light Court, I hereby deem this house a supernatural waypoint.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you!&#34; I jumped and hugged his neck. It wasn&#39;t official until he said so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch the merchandise.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;Because of You I have my whelplings. Because of my nephew this world is Sanctuary the War is over. There is Peace.&#34; He let that sink in. &#34;My mother is free, and my father as a gift takes his claws off this world. This visit wouldn&#39;t be possible until now.&#34; He picked me up under my armpits and put me on the couch. &#34;Now where was I? Oh yeah. Her visitation is one way because the other side holds man eaters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34; Said mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s partly why she was turned. If you want to live over there, I mean, I&#39;m not *against* turning you, but I&#39;m sure you Want to stay Light marked.&#34; Said Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arviel even denied mother the right to make Angelica a mate.&#34; Said Bryson. &#34;And he&#39;s right, taking that many for nothing is cheating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is, but I didn&#39;t say that I wouldn&#39;t trade him someone like. Hmm Tamriel&#39;s wife? I&#39;m sure the wife of an angel should be enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haven and Hell almost went to war for my eldest.&#34; Said Bryson. &#34;Things are too fresh for fuck ups.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all more or less agreed to that statement. Honestly, I did too. I know I&#39;ll see them age and die but death is just the beginning of their journey Above. It&#39;s Selfish to Force them to be in my world Below They won&#39;t get the favor and fortune I have *I&#39;m* the one mated to a general.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only those of supernatural blood, or those mated to a supernatural may go through that door., IF you manage to get to her, you&#39;re human she&#39;s *not*. The ghouls will rip you apart after the vampires drain you, or the witches use you for experimentation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pointed to the little closet by the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put the sticker on the back of the wall. She can visit whenever she likes. If you want her to come, knock three times on the sticker.&#34; He said smiling. &#34;And I won&#39;t be taking your ability to talk about this, not even the child. Blab and the lot of you will break your oath, and belong to Hell. Well except the baby; she&#39;ll get *once* freebie. She&#39;s young; she&#39;ll be the one to likely talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We won&#39;t tell anyone if it means I get to see my daughter and my grandchildren.&#34; Said mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We already agreed to it&#34; Said dad, while my uncle nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead dear.&#34; Said mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, but it didn&#39;t take any effort. The moment I put that sticker in the wood, it burned into the wall. I could see the packhouse living room but no one seemed to notice me looking. It only activates with supernatural hands though</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Xaxas!&#34; I resisted the urge to hug him. I&#39;m pretty sure he won&#39;t like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If not for you, I wouldn&#39;t have children of my own. I cannot allow one who holds my favor to shed tears.&#34; He said softly. He also made a portal. &#34;Kaizen what the fuck are you doing? Hurry up and console your mate!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With magic, I was put into the loving embrace of my mate and pups. The tears of joy were wiped by Kaizen, and he kissed my forehead softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; He said looking me in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mama!&#34; Beamed Vex, jumping up as high as he could to lick the bottom of my chin. Both now wiggled like little goldfish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They talk.&#34; Mumbled dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, they also chew everything too.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;Sorry. I was going to get their baby bag and stuff, but I can just walk through the closet later right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup.&#34; Said Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I hold them?&#34; Asked dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t see why not.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;If you want to pupsit, I need to hellfire-proof the house.&#34; He snapped his fingers. &#34;My magic is Shit BUT. Wait that *is* right right?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s right.&#34; Said the Three Princes at the same time.</p>
