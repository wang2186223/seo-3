                <p>A/n: It dawned on me that you&#39;re right Victoria. When I wrote Kaiden&#39;s book, the year was 2020, and this is I think almost 160 years or so after that, but the time period didn&#39;t change (pre-pandemic 2000&#39;s) so the year I think is 2180? That sounds about right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also, I was gone bc of stress. My pipes burst, my online degree (the Phd) is invalid.. I resigned my old job (NDA), Thankfully,  I&#39;m alright financially.  The degree part of this is especially stressful, but I&#39;ve been assured I did all I can.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also I wasn&#39;t doing anything important lol. It sounds like I was out here with the FBI-CIA-Mega Ultra Force, Unit A. At least I went to &#39;normal&#39; school for the master&#39;s. I should have just stayed in my damn old school instead of being cheap!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lightning flashed, the rain poured while the boys were with Herculian and Elinore. Diana and Eternya were in the human village below our feet. She wanted to see Eskaal&#39;s work, and Eternya went to make sure she didn&#39;t rip down any magic to rebuild it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Diana and Eskaal are natural enemies. No matter how accomplished, each thought their work was better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[When I find you, I&#39;m beating your ass!] Yelled Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/I&#39;d like to see you try./ I sang in a link. /You&#39;re getting colder. Cold as ice./</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Damn you!] She growled. [Ew! I stepped In Mud!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I covered my mouth to laugh. It was just a puddle, but according to her, she was climbing mountains. That was probably the first time she&#39;d gotten mud between her toes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was raining, but a little water didn&#39;t stop my mate on her exam. She had to find me, but I was literally right behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stalked Willow like a Rogue looking to mug her in the street. She asked me to, and I was planning on committing to the bit. Scaring her was my goal if she failed, if only to just mess with my mate a little. She was shifted, and sniffing around but I could tell she was overwhelmed. She knew my scent, but she didn&#39;t know anything about how to actually find me with it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She circled me, completely oblivious that I was a nose length away I was crouched in a bush, silent as a mouse. I was impressed that she did technically locate me, but that wasn&#39;t enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she didn&#39;t find me by 9, she&#39;d fail her exam too However, I must be firm. She won&#39;t learn anything if I pop up prematurely, or make noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/You&#39;re getting warm./ I half lied. She was closer, but still facing the wrong direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[There you are!] She bit a leaf I was still behind her, and her Warrior friends were snickering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll get him Luna.&#34; Said Warrior Captain Lu.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Ugh! It&#39;s so hard. It&#39;s like he&#39;s right behind me!] She yelled, then whipped around. [You. Dick.] She hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You pass.&#34; Said Lu. He laughed with her friends, and she had her tail in the air like the Luna she was it made me proud, but I would keep messing with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[What? No fight?] She complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t fight me.&#34; I said with crossed arms. To be honest That sounded kind of hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[I totally could!] She barked at me. She was threatening to bite me with her posture, and I *should* have shifted and made her submit and all the things that come with being an Alpha, but I honestly would let her have this. I knew she was messing around, and even if she was serious, I&#39;d let her win. Fuck I&#39;d even roll on my belly if it kept her smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not shifting.&#34; I sang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried nipping me, and I was going to dodge. But then I let her. To be an ass, I yelped. I was so high pitched I think even the men bought it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shifted. &#34;Oh no! you&#39;re not bleeding, are you?!&#34; She tried checking my arm, and I used the excuse to pick her up and kiss her in the rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blushed a ruby red, but I had her in my arms now. As corny as it was, I walked home with her like this. The pups were at Flora&#39;s, but I was sure she wanted to freshen up a bit before we went over there. I let her have my wet t-shirt; she was still modest about the nudity part of shifting. No one looked at her like that but I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought I was helping my sweet little foxy mate, not a shark.&#34; I chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m supposed to show you I&#39;m in charge!&#34; She shouted still a little upset that she thought she harmed me, but also upset that I tricked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmhmm. You&#39;re in charge.&#34; I relented. Any other Alpha would die before they admitted defeat, but if she wants to be Alpha and 1st General, be my fucking guest. We changed upstairs, and I found an umbrella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s so funny?&#34; She whined with a small smile. Her tail would be wagging if it were out. Inside, it seemed everyone who was from the last Warrior patrol were also soaked, and to a non-shifter, the house would stink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That you get to deal with *ALL* the shit on our desk while I get to play with the boys.&#34; I smiled. &#34;I&#39;ll gladly be your Lune.&#34; I chuckled. &#34;That is the male noun for &#39;Luna&#39;.&#34; I said this as we entered our room. With my natural heat, I dried the wet wolf scent off myself, while Willow took a really quick shower. She put on my tshirt and some loose shorts. I had just some sweats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like a break?&#34; She asked honestly. &#34;Tomorrow is just I think a civil court day, right?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t mind dealing with the contractor elves too.&#34; I said thinking out loud. I trusted her; she&#39;d do fine. &#34;And if they try to re-negotiate, you can link me.&#34; I said kissing her on the forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can do that. Tomorrow, take the pups with you on a vacation.&#34; She smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boys were already out when we went to Flora&#39;sShe went right to sleep too. The room here looked a lot like ours, though the guest bed was designed for a mortal. I dangled off it, and that added to the insomnia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t Sleep. I had time off and I knew *exactly* were to go. But I couldn&#39;t take the pups to hell, they&#39;d come back teenagers</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m sure she&#39;d actually kill me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell, the Horned One and the Pale Lady would help, even though they would be the ones who dote on them. That gave me an idea Grandfather controls even the time passage in his realm I&#39;ll try that first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then there&#39;s father; he&#39;ll be plan B. I&#39;m sure mom would love to have the boys, or maybe uncle Asanguis, Plan C. He doesn&#39;t talk much but I know he has a soft spot for the young. He reaps us all, but he&#39;s spoken with me about how he hates reaping so much potential, that the young have as of yet to actually experience life. He&#39;s told me that he&#39;s reaped at least 10 who were supposed to be curers of major mortal diseases or mass peace, yet, they typically don&#39;t make it past 3.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gossip is that the interference is on purpose, but he also told me not to repeat that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas is Plan: Nobody Else Wants Them... They&#39;re cute, but he won&#39;t want to care for them, just play and I can&#39;t do that to Harmony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eternya played with the ring he wore on his pinky. &#34;My lord you seem excited.&#34; He chuckled, holding a sleeping Elinore in his arms. &#34;I&#39;m surprised you aren&#39;t &#39;talking&#39; with her again.&#34; He made air quotes. Herculian scoffed a laugh with Diana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eskaal snored on the couch like an old man, well. Technically he *was* an old man. To be fair though he worked a lot of magic into the ground to make sure the human area was safe and thriving There was still the issue of how I&#39;d *keep* that area populated, but maybe I could buy them females and let nature take its course?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s a little cruel but if I bought 5 or 6 women, they&#39;d either be culled or made into &#39;breeders&#39; anyway But I&#39;d also be kind of supporting the system by buying so many mortals. They&#39;re expensive too, and rightly so with all the regulations. It isn&#39;t that I&#39;m against the farm, but I don&#39;t want to directly be the cause of mortal suffering. Not if I can help it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But would they suffer? They&#39;d be technically freed with the condition of bondage to a man. Maybe I could ask for their opinion first? If they willingly choose to come that&#39;s different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m not buying some horses to make my pasture look nice. I&#39;d be buying a living mortal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You better not be like Ash.&#34; Warned Diana, halting such a serious internal debate. &#34;Your grandparents would make the rest of us jealous with their shameless escapades.&#34; She looked *so* tired, but she also looked genuinely happy...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gross.&#34; I said rolling my eyes. &#34;How&#39;d the playdate go?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine as always.&#34; Said Diana. She held her sleeping son. He did so with his eyes open. One eye was red now, while the other was blue. &#34;Hillius doesn&#39;t see them as &#39;pups&#39; but rather people. He also thinks it isn&#39;t fair that other children aren&#39;t born learned as he was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was *seventeen* pounds. I&#39;m pretty sure no woman anywhere wants to go through *that*&#34; I outwardly smiled, but that fantastical bullshit is why I&#39;m glad our pups were born this way, if you could call how violent it was better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He should have been 25.&#34; She said with a light smile. &#34;I know it sounds fantastical, but my people are designed to do this. Our hips are wider, but more importantly our magic aids us. It&#39;s why our magicless women birth less often, or need C-section.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, my half-brother helped.&#34; Said Herculian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which one?&#34; I asked not actually caring, just glad that they got help in general.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aris. He also wants you to summon him.&#34; Said Herculian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not a chance.&#34; I said finishing my soda. Diana didn&#39;t chill it with her magic, but her hands were full.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can put in a good word for him. He may be my father&#39;s favorite son. But the God of War is honorable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll summon him while on vacation then. I&#39;ll be on an adventure tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re going to hell, that&#39;s just mean.&#34; Said Diana. &#34;You know the Lord of Judgment and the Lord of War have beef.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And that&#39;s *exactly* why I plan to go somewhere where I will have backup that *can* aid me if you&#39;re wrong.&#34; I said seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The God of War when I was in my 20&#39;s tried to kill Queen Harmony, my little cousin. I don&#39;t know if they still have beef or did they figure something out, but I would make sure my wife doesn&#39;t end up a single parent. There&#39;s always a bigger fish, but it just so happened that I was the grandson of one of the biggest. I&#39;d use that for my pups, without hesitation.</p>
