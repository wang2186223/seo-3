                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked twice Grace was pretty forward</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What would happen?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re already marked by grandfather so I was going to try and turn you into a Horned Wolf.&#34; she smiled. &#34;You won&#39;t be a demigoddess, but you&#39;d be like us, only the wolf.&#34; She smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then I&#39;d be like Kaizen I would probably have to learn how to be a wolf without losing my mind</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For them to ask it so casually That meant they were really confident about this.But I&#39;d no longer be human. I&#39;d be a werewolf. I wouldn&#39;t be powerless, but I would no longer be myself either I accepted Kaizen, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d accept this. I can&#39;t risk it. I&#39;m already linked to Kaizen, that should be enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I said firmly. &#34;I&#39;m happy with what I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And we respect that.&#34; Said Harmony. &#34;Sorry if us asking was awkward We all felt that if you were stronger, you&#39;d be safer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Plus, you already carry the Horned One&#39;s mark on your neck So we know the transformation would have been a success.&#34; Said Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleep on it.&#34; Said Isabelle. &#34;If you want to be something else, we might be able to arrange it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother I think it more that she is proud of her mortality, and remains to stay herself Being a Horned Wolf does have its moments were you lack controlbut that feeling is few and far between.&#34; Said Grace</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re spot on It Sounds cool, but that&#39;s the kind of magic that might have some kind of side affect...&#34; I said eating a pancake They brought bacon and other sides to the table as well, but it didn&#39;t hold any flavor. &#34;I figured you guys wanted to talk to me about something serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, that&#39;s only half true.&#34; Said Harmony. &#34;We wanted to socialize with you too, have coffee, tea, or whatever.&#34; She smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m being such a Brat too.&#34; I said looking at the table. I still felt like it was my right to feel like this yet the more I hung onto it. The more guilt and shame I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you&#39;re allowed to be hurt.&#34; Said Harmony, she put her hand on mine. And it felt like she was honestly trying to make me feel better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel like an ass.&#34; I mumbled. &#34;I feel like like I ate a lemon rind.&#34; I said feeling dirty</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the mate bond. Your soul searches for confirmation that your mate&#39;s ok.&#34; Said Isabelle. &#34;We can help you if you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would like that.&#34; I said eating my last pancake I almost felt guilty that I had something so good while Kaizen likely had unspeakable horrors happen to and around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now not only did my food taste like cardboard, but I also lost my appetite</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They held my hand, and we got in the car. We drove back, and I was taken to the Queen&#39;s chambers. Inside, there were black cushions everywhere, at least 14 or 15. Servants were in there, though they stood. The gold trim on all the black fabric looked almost like real gold. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was, seeing as how everything was so lavishly decorated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samira walked to a fountain it had glowing blue water. It came out a howling wolf&#39;s mouth, and on the lip of the base were cups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to drink this and sit on a cushion.&#34; She said taking a sip as well. &#34;You will have peace of mind. The original Wolf Queen, Gweneth, taught me how to use this thing It is the Moon Goddess&#39;s blessed waters.  She told me this wolf is of her father-in-law, Grendel the First Wolf.&#34; She smiled. &#34;Drink and you won&#39;t feel like you do and it won&#39;t turn you either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; I said taking the porcelain tea cup from her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t taste like water, it tasted kind of like chalk. It was slightly sweet, smelling like daisies I did fell calmer, kind of like I&#39;d had chamomile tea</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found myself closing my eyes while they sat next to me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I felt really hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I then felt as if I had been picked up and taken somewhere. I opened my eyes. I felt weird</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then calm</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that supposed to happen?&#34; Asked one of them. How much time had passed I had no idea</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Said Harmony, freaking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>------Kaizen-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked as my wolf into the grand colosseum arena it was black stone, and large enough for small ship battles. They even had levers around the arena to close to trap water overtop dark garnet sand my grandparents this time were the ones who would view this demonstration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted, being clothed in a robe similar, but not as fancy as the Horned One. I believe he made these himself. He was weird, but the last 50 days or so, he watched</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d finished my penance, with a day left to spare. They thought it best to show hell but most importantly my victims. Every person I&#39;d ever killed, murder or not, now belonged to the Horned One.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They did not look as pitiful as I thought they&#39;d be. They looked healthy in clean clothes, as most of the souls here were. The Repentant Layer was nothing like the others This layer had a city that looked like ancient Rome, though the stone here was black, as well as the dirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slah-hesh&#39;Rrah was his true form. &#34;Master,&#34; He bowed to the viewing booth. &#34;I, your humble Lord of Murder, have rehabilitated your grandson, the young master Kaizen, the Horned Wolf, The Charred One. May this demonstration give you closure, little souls maimed by my lord.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Continue.&#34; Said grandfather stoically from the booth though no one had any problem hearing him. His voice reverberated through the air. It seeped into the soul, that even if somehow you didn&#39;t have ears, you&#39;d know what he said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve had dummies and surrogates to practice with This time it will be your Real mate.&#34; He said snapping his fingers. &#34;That was *Really* easy&#34; He mumbled.  He cleared his throat. &#34;This time the demons will be real. This time should you lose your mind, you will lose your mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You go too far Lord Slah-Hesh&#39;Rra.&#34; I sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see the thin red line that linked us That really was Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I&#39;m proving a point.&#34; He said summoning then pulling a lever while still in the middle of the arena. Willow was on a cushion from the palace. She looked so peaceful in her sleep. &#34;3,2,1, Go.&#34; He said as there were clicks. The sand around her became lava</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was around her in a ring that seemed to be growing. So this was timed too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit!&#34; I said deciding that I should use my abilities to teleport to her, then defend her with my bow would be best. In mortal form I had the most control For 24 years and 364 days my life was me and my bow If I wasn&#39;t in torment, I was being tested</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here.&#34; I was tossed a bucket of white tennis balls.  I put them on my arrows, and shot each demon individually</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They came at me from all directions, multiple shapes and sizes. All species. I shot them one at a time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using lightning under my feet to move, then taking my shot became as second nature as breathing This was easy. I even got the little imp that tried sneaking behind me. Him I felt bad about imps are only 3 feet tall or so I broke his collarbone, and he squealed like a stuck pig.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no pity for him from his kin though. He earned chuckles. Even grandfather looked amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t let my guard down though; I knew this would keep going until I had to fight the Lord of Murder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And indeed, he charged at me, dodging my arrows. I used lightning to teleport, and he wielded two 4 foot long meat cleavers, swinging them wildly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dodged as the crowd went wild, and I blocked both his massive swings with my bow. He was trying to shove me away from Willow and into the lava, but I wouldn&#39;t let him. At his true height, he was massive, but he wasn&#39;t as strong as me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young master you fight well.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;But you forget I have a hard head.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not a good ide-&#34; I was cut off by the loud smack of his skull forehead against my horns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. and he cracked his skull-face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bowed to me in surrender and there were claps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve seen enough.&#34; Said the Horned One. &#34;Be Proud my son.&#34; He said using his magic to put Willow in my arms. He put both his hands on my shoulders. &#34;Go be with your mate.&#34;</p>
