                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was pretty tired, but I really did need to make sure a wolf like him was under my control. There was no way I&#39;d just assume he was alright with the mate I have. Lycans are NOT like normal werewolves since they too have no inner wolf, the Crave affects them differently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With wolves, they can at least attempt to fight the urge Lycanthropes Seek out human flesh. They are often cast out of packs, as they really do attract the Church and Hunters by their appetites, unruly, disobedience, and worst of all, their Alpha Strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They are sometimes called bulls because they are so stubborn, rude, and think differently. They don&#39;t have a pack mentality They prefer being loners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I invited the Worst possible candidate into this pack, but I didn&#39;t want to kill him, so I should stop complaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked to the Homeowner&#39;s Association, and right at the door, was a half angel. Those were so rare I only knew of Just two, a pair of twins who monitor my Uncle Xaxas&#39;s palace island for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If there were more, I wouldn&#39;t know, but by his badge he was likely the one in charge of security.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you the Idiot who let this mongrel in?!&#34; He shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They have no fear, being made from the Sun God, the Lord of Light. They were the protectors of man, and now that there was a &#39;man&#39; here in the form of my mate, I Knew anything I said would only make more yelling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about the same height as me, with curly blonde hair that literally glowed. It was pulled into a warrior&#39;s manbun, so I could guess it was pretty long. Universally, long hair indicated strength. I could also assume the saturated color of his wings also indicated he was the child of a high ranking angel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also held wings of black that reflected blue. That was the indication that he was half. True angels only had vibrant, light colors. They also had a full glow, not just the hair and eyes. He had golden honey eyes and skin like mine. He wasn&#39;t a demigod, but angels are my opposite. A Real fight with him would be one Actually to the death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had on sterling silver armor with the stomp of his foot, and I could only assume his longsword may have been the same. As a wolf. Silver stops healing, and attacks the cells in our bodies In the blood, it can turn a healthy person into nearly an Omega, as too much can also prevent the shift in those who have the double faceted soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All supernaturals had Some aversion to it, but that didn&#39;t scare me. So long as the Lord of Light didn&#39;t mark him as grandfather did me, I should be fine. That didn&#39;t mean I&#39;d be a dick though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will not argue with you. I Am an Idiot.&#34; I said putting my head to my temples. &#34;And on top of it, all the supernaturals that have a culture similar to werewolves kneeled to me this morning, giving oaths in blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked pretty shocked that I wasn&#39;t belligerent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard.&#34; He took his hand off the pommel of his sword He came and shook my wristbut I did get a little burned. &#34;. Child of the Horned One. Please tell me you protect this world.&#34; He said seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So long as I am not commanded, I am not. Plus, grandfather promised grandma he wouldn&#39;t smite this world so long as their blood lives on it.&#34; I smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let a small smile crease his perfect face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Sentinel, Servant of Arviel, Son of General Tamriel of the Raven Wing and Vivian Lancaster.&#34; He said seriously. &#34;I was made to protect this quadrant with my father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh? I am Kaizen, son of Birrai&#39;shivaal God of Retribution, and Third Wolf&#39;s Seat Isabelle, the Charred One, the Risen One.&#34; I said seeing him look surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have your file I didn&#39;t believe the Royal family would hunt one of their own, but you did kill over 25 of your own men.&#34; He said scratching his chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked twice. I killed 5 *Units*not 5 wolves I didn&#39;t even remember their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not remember beyond the unit that ran with me. Yet those nameless hurt just as bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stole the lives of multiple families mates were not to be in the same unit so  The pack back home mourned</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That really wasn&#39;t my home anymore I could NEVER go back I could never have the heart to look them in the eyes and tell them &#39;sorry&#39; for stealing half their souls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assume by that look, you let your inner instinct get the better of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did for my mortal mate&#39;s sake.&#34; I said as a warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. &#34;Come with me. The prisoner is up and should he prove he&#39;s safe, I&#39;ll put him into your custody. To be honest I only came down here because my mother lives here. She&#39;s a vampire now, along with all the humans in this neighborhood but before the Night stole her from me, she was a good woman. She still is&#34; He said leading me to the basement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, you&#39;d never think such a generic place had such an old, dark, but dry cellar. No one was down there, but I knew why. There was a Solid Sterling Silver Ring with chains, and dry ash underneath. It was positioned in a way that all the silver barred cells would see they were next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Church was Brutal to those who broke the law, but to be fair they had to be someone like him could kill a mortal with just his grip For him to have been &#39;created&#39; I knew Sentinel was at least as old as the Goblin Crown Prince, Wix.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He Hid that he was the standing Goblin King. Likely because he knew I would have Left. I don&#39;t want anymore trouble but I didn&#39;t get something either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. Why are all these unknown old lines and men coming to ME? It&#39;s like the Less I want the More I receive but now that an angel was here, even though he was half, another worry was added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came here personally to deal with this because I might have alerted Arviel, the Lord of Light, that a literal child of the Lord of Night is making minions. Now that I was on his radar there may come a time where I have to explain my situation to the Sun God</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Willow-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew I was dreaming. There was no way I wasn&#39;t. I shed tears as I watched my funeral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s ok Art.&#34; Said my uncle to my dad. &#34;It&#39;ll be ok.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She Died on Her Birthday Clarence!&#34; Yelled my mom, being held by dad. &#34;Don&#39;t Tell Me It&#39;s Going to Be OK! IT&#39;S NOT!&#34; She screamed. &#34;My baby didn&#39;t Drink!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know dear there had to be some kind of mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from them was a man in almost black robes though in the light of the sun, I could tell it was blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. His scythe said Asanguis. And the hair on the back of my neck stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t run.&#34; The Grim Reaper commanded, and when I blinked, I fell over. I tripped on my fear, as he was Right in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to have been 9 feet tall His robe was pristine, but the face under the hood was not a scull like I saw in depictions of him it was young and angelic His blue hair peeked through his hood, since it was so long, I think it went to his belly button</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not dead!&#34; I yelled scooting away from him, and he laughed a hearty boom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. I wanted to see the scrawny woman that held me up for supper.&#34; He hissed like a snake with every &#39;s&#39;. He kneeled to my eye level, peering into my eyes. judging my soul. &#34;That is not my job, I merely am a bit curious why you&#39;re human.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still on the ground, but the hooded blue haired man his serpentine eyes were Cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He extended a long clawed hand to take. And I gently took it. There was no resistance I was unable to deny his nonverbal request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t take me, I&#39;m alive I promise.&#34; I mumbled, looking at my casket being lowered into the ground</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This Couldn&#39;t have all been a crazy dream I had while dying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I did die Maybe I killed us in that car crash maybe-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. *Maybe* you should say goodbye to your friends.&#34; He pointed with his free hand. He gently walked me to them They were bloody and mangled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran to hug them anyway. &#34;I&#39;m sorry!&#34; I screamed, shedding tears, but Drew laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t feel any of this.&#34; Said Amanda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Plus the trip was OUR idea not yours.&#34; Said Drew</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or the woods part. that was our idea too so&#34; Said Amanda, hugging me tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We shared that moment and I saw their graves were next to mine. But this would be the last time I saw them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their chests held golden rings mine held the symbol of the Horned One when we parted from our hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Holy shit.&#34; Said Drew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a mistake.&#34; Said Amanda. &#34;She literally taught Sunday school for Fun. What did you do? You weren&#39;t a serial killer or something right?&#34; Said Amanda as a joke, but tears streamed down her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no words I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever been more afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is married to my nephew, to say it in mortal terms. Father, should she die, will house her in his palace, or I, mine. As Death, I too have a pleasant place for the damned. She is safe with us, multiple gods favor her, and would Never allow harm to our blood.&#34; He said still hissing his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So this is it then.&#34; Said Drew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye mortal. I do this favor of my own accord, because I see the lives of every soul I ferry.&#34; He said putting his hand on the top of my head. &#34;And to those I touch. You three were as close as blood kin. I allowed you two to rest a few days before collecting you. Your families all mourn, but if they didn&#39;t, I would probably be throwing you lot into Hell.&#34; He joked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We hugged one more time. I felt peace Their rings on their chests glowed, feeling like the sun on a chilly day I could smell the grass and  purity from the light it made me tear up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where they were headed, I traded away I would never see them, nor any other good member of my friends and family again. But I still, even knowing that. feeling this I still did not regret my decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How strong was this bond, that even the touch of Haven&#39;s Light did not make me yearn to be there if Kaizen couldn&#39;t?</p>
