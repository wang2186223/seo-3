                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour had to pass before the King of Halves was alright. He shifted outside being at least 13 feet tall. He was covered in thick black Greek tattoos like the scrollwork on pottery.. It was around his tail, and on his back were three dots like his son, though they glowed red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I learned that was the birthmark passed from hiss father, and that his mother still lived. She ran an orphanage on the island of Antipaxas. Where his castle resided. I looked it up. That island was small and uninhabited for the most part on Doogle. Yet I knew better. That place was a sanctuary for his kind and it hurt him. It could not be denied that something like this wouldn&#39;t stress someone out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King walked in sporting an appendage that dangled to his knees It wasn&#39;t arousing, but it was  Surprising to say the least He had a pipe between those legs.. Holy Shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. &#34;I see you&#39;re still not used to the nudity part.&#34; He got his pants off the floor, and shimmied them on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boo.&#34; Said Noah with a thumbs down. &#39;Bring back the King of the Half Pipe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you understand him?&#34; Asked the King, and we both shook our heads. He ignored his mate&#39;s nonsense, while Alavastros hadn&#39;t said anything, nor had he touched his burger. He kept sniffing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t know English, Elvish, or Wolf.&#34; Said Kaizen, sharing his meal with me. Lunch was late, but we all wound up getting burgers from the grocery store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wall was being patched too, but what couldn&#39;t was how the King felt. He was rejected by someone he loved and found out that his child was abandoned on purpose Now that same son was Marked by Kaizen, but given a mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has horns I could share what I know.&#34; He offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You own him whatever you think is best.&#34; Said King Jerold stiffly. &#34;I mean no ill nephew this is just a lot.&#34; He said putting an ice pack to his head that was given to him by his mate. He translated Kaizen&#39;s offer, and Alavastros nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not see my fold as anything less than pack.&#34; Said Kaizen firmly. &#34;I know you know that, I just wanted to say it.&#34; He said getting up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kneeled and pressed his horns to our new pack member Jerold watched sternly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a way to meet. What&#39;s your name little vixen?&#34; The King asked gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow Charred sir.&#34; I said seeing him nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry about the news article.&#34; Said King Noah. &#34;We could have told the world of the way things truly work. But for the peace of free humans all over the world, and to prevent nuclear war, Xaxas deemed the world remain secret.&#34; He said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s probably the right thing. I saw one of the farms. I saw &#39;man meat&#39; in the grocery store. Nobody would be ok with that. They would likely lobby for the farm humans&#39; release, and I knew they have to eat or drink blood or whatever. So without farms I know creatures would go back to what they knew. Laws would be made to try and make them- no... us second class citizens.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No it would be that way for the mortals.&#34; Said Jerold. &#34;The master of this world He would be as he was in the old times Mortals in his eyes are meat. They would be treated like meat. This world under his rule would war itself into medieval times. His powers are absolute, that isn&#39;t an exaggeration either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could kind of feel that even before I was turned.&#34; I admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If he really wanted, he could let a broadcast be known and shut it all down, make the bombs and factories disappear, and plunge this world into dark times&#34;Said Noah, taking a cup of coffee from Warrior Hazi. &#34;But he does not because of Queen Harmony, her love for humans, and the sorrow it would bring his mother as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um.&#34; Said Alavastros. &#34;I know the language now.&#34; He said shyly. He was handed a fresher burger, but he looked confused. &#34;Can I eat this?&#34; He poked it gingerly. &#34;IS THIS COW?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;IT&#39;S PORK!!!&#34; yelled Kaizen lying, but the realization hit him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;IT&#39;S NOT!!! PEOPLE EAT COW! YOU&#39;RE ALL EATING COW!&#34; He streamed, and Jerold sheepishly slid his plate away from himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put mine down tooThis was bad planning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We only take a form that looks like a cow you&#39;re not a cow. Minotaur are our own people .&#34; Aditted Jerold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still Can&#39;t I just have grass?&#34; He asked looking at it suspiciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>----Kaizen----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw his memories They were mostly peaceful He ate grass with the Forest Guardians, spirit animals who protect wild, old areas, herding him across New England, ever westward, so he was hidden They used groves made by elves in the night, and portals made by fae for thousands of years Most who saw him thought he was a spirit too from a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They existed to keep the forests healthy and blessed. The death of one kills their lands to the point to where even wooden homes rot, and crops fail so his glittery white fur protected him from the supernaturalsWhite beasts are protected in every country, so he was protected from humans too. Though he was only Half bull. That protection left the moment he stands on two legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I had to deal with him freaking out about cows</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you wish to graze, we can arrange grain and hay but you&#39;re missing out.&#34; Said Uncle Jerold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It looks good and all, and smells it too. But some of my friends were cows. I knew they disappeared a lot but I thought it was because they just died not this.&#34; He said sadly. &#34;But just as the Great Moose told me.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;d he say?&#34; Asked my mate. She used her linking power for about the 4th time ever to ask them to round up some bread, rice, and tofu. Those grains would be too rich for him right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All that lives must die, and the dead feed the living.&#34; He said firmly. He even sounded like Jerold, though he was not as stern, being gentle spoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye.&#34; Said my Uncle Jerold. &#34;I know some of the centaur and unicorns might have some hay. But as a minotaur, you can eat meat too. If you want stuff like tofu and vegan human meals, you&#39;ll have to ween yourself onto it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alavastros nodded. &#34;I understand.&#34; He said being handed straw by a submissive centaur. He couldn&#39;t chew it in his human form. &#34;Bleh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About a half a bale was brought too, making the office smell like grass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerold chuckled. &#34;Do you have any tofu Equstin?&#34; He asked, knowing his name. The tall, milk chocolate-skinned man with mostly black wavy hair bowed, but I&#39;d seen his true form. The four white patches in his hair were actually the color of his lower legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sire.&#34; He bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the meantime, hay tastes better with a little salt, herbs and spices. You can cook it, fry it with other veggies, and fruits. If you don&#39;t mind Kaizen, I think I&#39;ll stay a bit to help him out.&#34; Said Jerold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. The only issue will be space. This house is big, but not the size of a true packhouse. The attic is mostly empty I bet a bed could fit up there until we truly convert it.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mind that at all, do you Noah.&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know my answer.&#34; He said shaking his head. He leaned on him like Willow does with me, and I know it calmed Jerold down to pet his soft, mortal hair Even now, Willow&#39;s hair was still soft, and her scent soothing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let&#39;s go downstairs hmm, my treat.&#34; He said getting up. He took the hay from his son, and we all followed him. I did out of curiosity, and to see that he got a pan from a cabinet. &#34;I&#39;m going to borrow some stuff. If it belongs to anybody, I&#39;ll replace it.&#34; He said but everyone offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all we were wolves. We would have heard even without the yelling. He put the grass in the pan with an onion he was given. It absorbed the oil and fried as he added garlic, some leftover rice, and some vegan protein supplements he&#39;d gotten from Elder Asmondi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alavastros looked intently as his stomach growled. He was handed a plate and sat at the table. All the while everything that was happening was a first for him Everything, even being inside a home, yet alone sitting like this, having a human form</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost felt bad for him, but he as a fellow Misfit would be fine. No one would mind his diet either, as we already had creatures here like unicorns who would have similar diets. My burger was cold, and we&#39;d left the food we waited for so long on our desk I sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The garlic was making me hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here Alpha.&#34; Said Jack. He&#39;d brought our food down without being asked to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry Alavastros, as you eat cud I need meat.&#34; I said glad that I didn&#39;t have any raw on my plate right now. That would be graphic for him. &#34;Oh, and I need to say this; most of us eat meat, even men. No one would lay a paw on you though.&#34; I said seeing him smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve had friends that were foxes. I know.&#34; He said taking a bite. &#34;This is good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s grass stir-fry. I used to make this during the war. With much less seasonings.&#34; Jerold&#39;s chair creaked under his weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the outside he shared a meal with his son I knew this hurt him. I knew as a son, and how I saw my father, I could not imagine being cast out by my own blood at birth His great sin was being born to a snobbish magic caster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were a strange lot They worry so much about the quality of their bloodline that they literally and figuratively stab each other in the back for a modicum of power Diana has that As Queen she could have changed the culture of her people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a Queen, they kneel to her. They were protected by her and her powers. She led them during the War of the Tyrant, yet. When it came down to it, she Wouldn&#39;t protect her own blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t look so glum.&#34; Said my uncle with a forkful of grass. &#34;The initial shock and stress is over let us make this troubling time joyful. You shared everything you could about wolves and your life, let me tell him mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would like that.&#34; He said bowing his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alavastros sensed the aura of his father. He was strong in his own right but Jerold held power that even I would have trouble besting He sat tall, being stoic, yet encouraging for his son&#39;s sake. After all, he found out the thing that a lot of half beasts do that they&#39;re unwanted a punishment shit.</p>
