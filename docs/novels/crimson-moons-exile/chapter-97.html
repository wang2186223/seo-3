                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At 11:30am, I had an appointment with &#39;Dr. Sampson&#39;. To be fair, I was glad that I chose to know who he was, since he was going to always be their doctor and mine. He inspected my incision, and hummed deeply. &#34;Such sloppy, rushed work. Forgive me small one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she alright?&#34; Asked Kaizen. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry Willow. I didn&#39;t realize birth was so complicated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay. Am I cleared to leave doctor?&#34; I asked the Horned One. He nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t see any reason why you should remain here unless you want.&#34; Said &#39;Dr. Sampson.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Kaizen, and the staff, I believe he had the appearance of a doctor but I knew better. I could see him in his black robes, horns, and flaming crown. He wore black sandals too. How did no one notice?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You&#39;d think Kaizen would figure it out by &#39;hearing&#39; me, but he was blissfully unaware.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Docktor is there anything I need to do for her, or the  pups?&#34; Asked Kaizen. He was overwhelmed as a new father, constantly driven to hunt, even though at this moment, he had a whole deer chopped up and in the hospital&#39;s fridge. The second one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. So long as she has fresh meat and plenty of water, She&#39;ll heal without issue.&#34; He said this with a knowing smile. He wrote on a clipboard, but I could see what it really was... it was a black scroll with red glowing ink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we&#39;ll take our leave sir. Thank you again for keeping my precious mate alive. If there&#39;s anything you could ask, so long as it doesn&#39;t conflict with my orders, I&#39;ll do it.&#34; Said Kaizen, shaking his wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The only thing I want, is that you continue to protect the Master&#39;s generals.&#34; He smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you know? Are you also marked by the Horned One? It&#39;s hard to see or feel anything off you other than you being a fae in general.&#34; He admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am just a typical doctor. When you live this long, you tend to simply know things.&#34; He said cryptically, but I don&#39;t think my mate caught his warning like I did. &#34;Let me see them, that I can give them a final once over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; Said Kaizen. He handed our squeaking babies to the Lord of Punishment, and he smiled. I don&#39;t think Kaizen saw or heard the words of the Void King, but I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marvelous work I have *outdone* myself indeed.&#34; He grinned. &#34;Splendid, themed names too I bless them with power. They will know their true strength as they grow. I will not hold back with this litter These pups, all four of them will be blessed without limitation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen seemed to be frozen in place, and I hesitated, but asked my questions anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All four?&#34; I asked. &#34;Do you bless all of them right now?&#34; I referred to Grace and Samira&#39;s pups too..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. &#34;This task is trivial little Willow. Everything in this world that is mine is Mine I Refuse to allow harm to come to them, after so much tension caused them in the first place.&#34; he said giving them to me. &#34;Love your children. Do not fear what they will become. They will only be &#39;monsters&#39; should you fail them.&#34; He warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t.&#34; I said confidently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is why I gave you two.&#34; He admitted. &#34;They are Swift And Powerful a combination that is not meant to exist, since I am to choose one or the other. Even great Layer Lords will tremble at their feet by the time they are of age to grow flesh But for now, they are adorable. So much so that I had to bribe their grandmother not to come and coddle them.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If she comes, I&#39;ll let her hold them.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good luck getting them back. She pouts now even as we speak. Anyway. Let me restart time. It isn&#39;t good for ones so little.&#34; He grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the snap of his fingers, Kaizen was handed the pups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love your children, and do not fear who they become. If they are poor, it is because you raised them poorly.&#34; He said disappearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ready to go?.... That was. Cryptic.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am.&#34; I said confidently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen texted for the car to be readied, and within a few minutes, it was here. They had car seats, even though the pups wouldn&#39;t fit in there. I happily put them in their little crate, and they complained. They didn&#39;t like being out of mommy or daddy&#39;s arms, but they would have to like it. They had to be safe while driving, and there was no greater joy in my heart that they were here I never thought I&#39;d have kids so soon, yet here they were, and I was happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was noon. The sun was out, and birds were chirping. I was so flippin&#39; happy. I was Done with appointments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finally!&#34; I shouted, holding the pups while Kaizen had the baby bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember, slow and steady.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will.&#34; I said showing the pups the living room..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t even have open eyes to see, but they sniffed the air. They could get to know what home smells like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was tired but excited, since now I was home! I ran-walked up the stairs while my mate was right behind me. He wanted to make sure that I wasn&#39;t overdoing it, and I was, but I Needed this. There was nothing like home! No more IV, no more checks, or uncomfortable hospital cot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put our pups on the soft bed we had, and they seemed to kind of melt into the thick comforter. They sniffed it, being too young to really do anything other than squeak</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can watch them if you want to go out.&#34; Smiled my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to do anything other than be here in this moment with you and our little ones.&#34; I said looking at my phone. I had to feed them every 4 hours, but I also needed to use my pump. After getting what I needed, I fed the pups, and they were no trouble at all</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat on the rocking chair put in our room, and Kaizen took his chance to nap. He slept with the pups on his chest, being a proud, but also tired parent. He looked so peaceful, blissfully grinning in his sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got on his laptop, and looked at pack duties. I had no idea what I was doing still, but I wanted to help. I saw he had an email from Tyson, and photos were attached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a picture of his pup on the throne, inside his gold crown. It read &#39;Ha,ha  look at little Lustros. Samira thought this would be a cute Solsticemas photo, what do you think? &#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His pup looked like mine gods damn it that was cute. He was a small black ball of fluff, though unlike my pups, he had a white stripe down his nose, and it ran between his horns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two could play that game. I sent him a photo of the twins on Kaizen, and he called. I answered the first ring, glad that nobody woke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not trying to make a fireman calendar.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can call it Hot Bods and Cute Boys.&#34;  I grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. He&#39;s a bad influence.&#34; Tyson chuckled. &#34;Do you know how to send me a copy of the pups birth certificates so I can place the Royal Seal on them?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t.&#34; I said truthfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;ll contact the hospital, and I&#39;ll send official copies by an Omega.&#34; He said hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a nap in the rocking chair I wasn&#39;t even meaning to do it, but it was really comfortable. My body ached. It really did. There was no compromise to my heavy eyelids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt unnaturally warm and I opened my eyes. It was night, and Kaizen was still asleep there was a note on my lap that said he&#39;d fed them at 4, and it was 7:45 That meant in about 15 minutes, they needed dinner. I pulled out my pump, and I managed to get a whole SIX Ounces! I was a cow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at me.&#34; I giggled, putting what they needed in their bottles. I saved the rest for later And they feasted to their little hearts&#39; content, and just like that, they were out like a light. Caring for them at this stage was easy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Granted they knew nothing and did nothing. I was kind of already warned about what they will become Like their father, but I wouldn&#39;t let it consume me. Fear and overcorrection will make them the very thing I Don&#39;t want them to be. monsters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were physically &#39;monsters&#39; already, but not mentally They were little sponges, and what we teach them will help mold them Since this world was Sanctuary, I will teach them to preserve and protect this world, not be part of the problem. Kaizen&#39;s scrolls that he received to snuff threats were nearly endless, with varying degrees of importance. I would make sure they didn&#39;t end up on one</p>
