                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed, nephew Kaiden tasked me to deliver this to Tyson, but I know now that I am compromised. I won&#39;t make it that far if I keep my package .&#34; He said sheepishly. &#34;I went this route after my car started acting up, and I was right to follow my gut I still don&#39;t know how I wound up here safely. I felt almost watched until I got to your border, and a Warrior offered me a lift on ATV.&#34;&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe they were waiting for the right moment, and it never came?&#34; I said thinking out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That could be it.&#34; Agreed Kaizen. &#34;That and you were likely guided here. Did you encounter any other troubles?&#34; Asked Kaizen with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thankfully no.&#34; Said Eric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s everybody?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha does well. Beta Connor lately has been hanging out with the humans in the prison, and Shelly can&#39;t get Hank to take her position as Gamma. He never will; he doesn&#39;t want it. And the best news I got; he finally found a surrogate to have a pup. I&#39;m going to be a grandpa too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wonderful.&#34; Said my mate. &#34;Hank and Keith have been married at least 75 years. I don&#39;t blame him on not changing positions. Hank has a Good job, and he&#39;s good at it, running Horizon Prison with Grandfather since he turned 18. He Should be a Beta somewhere to be fair, but he chose to help his mother, Aunt Shelly, Gamma of CharredMoon.&#34; Kaizen said this to inform me, and I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s going to help them?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Warrior Eunice has grown pups from her late mate, so they agreed she was the best fit. Him and his husband are super excited, and honestly, I am too.&#34; He beamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good. Tell him to call so we can visit.&#34; I said with a smile. That was some good news. I wished that was all he came for</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s the prison? I assume he&#39;s going to go on leave once his pup&#39;s born.&#34; Kaizen asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Horizon houses all races, and is now the largest supernatural prison in the country. &#34;I hope things are good with you guys.&#34; He said with a small bow. I think it was politeness, as Eric is an Omega. Things like that are normal in wolf conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eric smiled at the pups, who were asleep again. They made their father&#39;s arm and chest into a muscular bed. Kaizen volunteered to put the pups in the other room They were starting to snore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is. Now that I&#39;m Alpha, people are able to have peace and clean papers.&#34; Kaizen grinned. He shrank so that Eric could be more comfortable. &#34;I can secure safe passage, but once you leave my territory, the eyes and ears of those who are curious may end you. Word like this travels fast..&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;And I don&#39;t think I have anyone I can spare to ride with you Not with my boys so small.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I figured as much .. I was hoping I could leave it with you.&#34; He said handing him the black wax sealed letter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh? Let me see.&#34; Kaizen opened the letter with a claw, and sternly read the note. &#34;It says, Dear Tyson, I bet the first thing you&#39;ll do is tell Kaizen and Grace, but I believe you should wait. I have your traitor. He&#39;s in a cell waiting for you to come collect him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t get him to talk, but I can bet if you leave the castle, someone is going to try to break into the Vault again. I pray that does not happen. Just because our patriarch cannot die does not mean that he won&#39;t feel what they will do to him. It will prevent him from waking too, since he won&#39;t be whole if they steal an organ</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s why he trusted you as his protector. You&#39;re more capable than I. You and Kaizen. I don&#39;t want to ask him though; I don&#39;t think it fair I ask anything of my grandson. When he was a fugitive, I did not lend a claw to aid him. I do not consider Grace, because she rules another peoples. I also thought it best to leave her be, since she expressed that she wants to retire a bit to raise her lil&#39; boy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if I did not let you three be men and women, you wouldn&#39;t learn anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brutus may be dead, but his followers infect the Midwest like a disease It festers and rots like a freshly popped boil. Flush it out. If you need me, now that you have established yourself, and Kaizen is Pardoned by the Realm King, I know my aid will only be complementary for you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now if I approached the Charred Throne, they know I am there for business, and nothing else</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good luck. I still remember letting you ride on my head as a hat. Or the time I kidnapped you three while Izzy was asleep, so I could teach you to swim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You know she&#39;s *still* pissy about that?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, and send me pictures of my lil&#39; boy. I have Zolotos, Grace&#39;s lil gold pup, but you bums don&#39;t call or visit! How am I going to add to the family photo book without family photos?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With love</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Your grandpa, the Coolest Grandpa in fact. Don&#39;t forget it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That sounds pretty urgent.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is actually the first break I&#39;ve gotten since picking up the letter..&#34; Said Eric. &#34;Kaiden couldn&#39;t trust this with anyone else. Everything&#39;s fine *now* but earlier there was a bit of an issue with one of our Omegas. Treason is the short of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gods damn it.&#34; Said Kaizen shaking his head. &#34;I can take you with me to pick up, and deliver the traitor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My lord the only way you&#39;d get there as fast as you suggest, is with magic no thank you.&#34; Said Eric formally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;ll arrange Wix to lend his private jet, and you can go home in style AFTER you rest.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure?&#34; Asked Eric. &#34;I can just buy a commercial ticket&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d rather you use Wix&#39;s private airline. His pilot is a manticore. Decimus actually lives here if you want to talk to him too.&#34; Smiled Kaizen. &#34;I&#39;ll go ahead and leave. See you later.&#34; He kissed me on the forehead, and vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate it when they do that.&#34; Complained Eric. &#34;Grace does that too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Got the Rogue.&#34; Said Jack behind Eric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There is no sound when Jack appears He&#39;s just there. I hate it. I hate it so much, because no matter how many times I&#39;ve seen it, I&#39;m never prepared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah! Stop it!&#34; Eric growled, though his wolf was dormant so it sounded like a regular, human grumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry. I can&#39;t help it. Maybe I should click my tongue or something for you lot.&#34; He chuckled. Jack was also covered in that wolf&#39;s blood. I know he hadn&#39;t slashed anyone in a little while so that guy probably got a few days&#39; worth of Jack&#39;s pent-up aggression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Kaizen------</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shortcut through hell was the usual. The screams of the masses below The demons who loved their work, the stench of sulfur and tar Typical graphic penance for typical terrible people. Who knows, maybe some of them will learn their lesson. I&#39;d used this technique a few times now, and I figured it would be safer to materialize in the forest, than in the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I popped out the other side to the green lush forest. I was also shifted. I was faster, but the Warrior unit that saw me materialize out from the ground with black and red smoke stopped whatever horseplay they were doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was my wolf, imposing since I held the candle&#39;s flame between my horns. Right now, I would be the size of the original Wolf King, maybe a little bigger, though only to father&#39;s shoulder.Father, nor I *technically* count as werewolves now seeing as how my status changed that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the Fuck!&#34; Screamed Jason, my uncle Connor&#39;s son. He was beta of CrimsonMoon, the next pack over by only 25 miles. &#34;Kaisen is that *you?!*&#34; He yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the Wolf King&#39;s line looked like him. Jason was no exception. He looked like grandfather, except his eyes were green, not amber. Me and my siblings were the exception however we looked like father, since well He&#39;s the Lord of Justice. We take after him because he&#39;s higher than a king Plus father looks like the Horned one, and I doubt he&#39;d make us look like someone else to be fair</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. It seems I landed between Charred and Crimson. Is everything alright?&#34; I asked shifting to my true mortal form. I was leaner than Tyson, but much faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is now holy shit.&#34; Jason was flabbergasted to say the least. He&#39;d seen me before I was given my title officially. Now I was bigger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll meet you at CharredMoon then.&#34; I bolted across the sky as red lightning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did this as a man while they likely shifted. I had better control of my power in this shape, plus I figured wolves wouldn&#39;t feel as threatened by seeing my human form. Regular wolves went to my elbows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I landed, and walked in. The place looked the same The dark hardwood and light furniture was old, colonial style. Grandpa Kaiden was born around the Revolutionary War I think, but his mannerisms were more modern. Not his taste though This place looked like the cover of a Southern Cooking Magazine or something. The living room alone was probably twice the size of mine. It was built to house plenty of wolves, having at least 50 or 60 rooms, and about 5 stories high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody stopped me as I walked to the base of the stairs I&#39;m sure they knew they couldn&#39;t. the looks though from these wolves. It felt like I was being judged. They knew who I was The Packmate Killer that was the common thought rolling around in the airand the fear of my strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear their links, and scent their fear. Not a soul trusted me, nor did they agree with the sentence of the Realm King. That was the common theme I knew I would have to endure for the rest of my life Pack killings are serious almost always met with banishment or beheading</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held my head high. I was an Alpha now, and I would not make myself look as the vagabond that I was. I, no matter what, am a proud wolf. One fuck up does not define me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here!&#34; I shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait what happened?&#34; Asked grandpa Kaiden. He came and pressed his forehead to mine. Grandpa was 6&#39;8, yet I had to bend down since I&#39;m 7&#39;5. It&#39;s funny how supernaturals work. We&#39;re bigger than mortals by so much It&#39;s partly why we don&#39;t socialize in the mortal world I would stick out like a sore thumb, even when I shrink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eric made a detour and broke down at Misfit. Good thing he did. Where&#39;s the traitor?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got him in solitary. Hank can bring him here was that you?&#34; He asked, referring to the lightning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;m the only one that can outright do that.&#34; I said thinking out loud.</p>
