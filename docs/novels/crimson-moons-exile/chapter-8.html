                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I don&#39;t like this I want to honestly be away from you.&#34; I told him, and he shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless of my wishes, it wasn&#39;t like he could just let me out the car and I&#39;m off on my merry way. I didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t remember what I heard. I couldn&#39;t recall why the panda shifter freaked me out or why the vampires were so scary. All I knew was the last words the head one said but even the details on his &#39;order&#39;, the very thing that controlled me in the first place was distorted in my memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand. You saw the man&#39;s meat process. They leave nothing out. I bet you don&#39;t remember the assembly line, do you?&#34;  he looked me in the eyes briefly, knowing full well that I didn&#39;t but he was still trying to be polite about it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. Assembly line? Thinking about details made my head hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was a haze nothing seemed real, though the only injection I got I SAW my leg heal in real time. Maybe it was that that had me so out of it. Yet it could not be denied that in this mind fog, I was aware what was going on</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence spoke paragraphs it made me uncomfortable, seeing as how Kaizen&#39;s mouth was slightly covered in blood I wondered did he eat someone. The answer was obviously yes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no choice.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;Sorry I didn&#39;t mean to come off so rude about it, but I need Meatand they didn&#39;t have any cattle meat. This facility only processes men.&#34; He looked almost angry about that fact. Angry at himself for having to do what he Had to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get that but couldn&#39;t you have taken me somewhere anywhere else?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. But I think you&#39;re looking more for an explanation I need a higher calorie intake than my siblings because of my abilities, my metabolism is Much faster. Hospitals would call the Secret Police, and I honestly I don&#39;t want to kill any more people. I would to protect you though.&#34; He said looking at the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was an anger in his eyes some hatred of that statement</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But that&#39;s what you are as scary as that is I respect that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I fear the longer you stay with me.&#34; He trailed off, but I finished the statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The more I&#39;ll see&#34; I said looking out the passenger side window. I meant what I&#39;d said. He saved my life at the cost of his home. At the cost of having a regular supply of food, shelter, and his family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I lost all that because I knew too much</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The entire process is behind glass, so when they have an inspection, there&#39;s nothing they can hide. I understand you&#39;re scared, but don&#39;t be scared of me. I won&#39;t harm you. I literally swore I wouldn&#39;t but I understand. I&#39;m a monster.&#34; He said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t &#39;forget&#39; he read my mind and knew my feelings but I was human I was a woman who didn&#39;t know a Thing about self-defense next to a man eater</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yet even under this spell, I don&#39;t see myself without you.&#34; I said honestly. I couldn&#39;t see myself without my protector but this could be all the magic stuff they did to me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That makes me happier than you&#39;ll ever know.&#34; He looked like he debated on saying something, but chose to change the subject. &#34;But in the meantime, there&#39;s a hotel off the next exit. I know you&#39;d like to sleep in a bed rather than in the car.&#34; He said with a small smile When he looked like that, even knowing what he&#39;d done. One could momentarily forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would.&#34; I agreed. &#34;Plus, that gives me a chance to take a shower that place made me feel dirty.&#34; I said shedding tears, suddenly feeling sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you get some sleep, you should be free of both the vampire and unicorn effects.&#34; He said pulling off the road. He wiped the tears off my face as gently as he could. &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; He apologized, but honestly, he didn&#39;t have to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m alright.&#34; I lied, and he kissed me on the top of the head when pulled into a old dusty hotel it looked like an old truck stop time forgot, with all the doors to each room on the outside of the cracked, litter covered parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hummed gently, and it made me lean into him His touch took all the bad away I forgot all the worry I held if only for a moment. That was addictive</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They say love is a drug.&#34; Said Kaizen kissing me once more .It took my breath away this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It gave me goosebumps. I felt almost as if I were being shocked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed me on the lips. It was soft, yet forceful. I knew I was kissing a prince. I could feel it in his touch that he was a leader It aroused mehis grunt did too. &#34;I&#39;ll go inside. If you want, you can stay in the car.&#34; He said leaving, knowing Full well what he&#39;d done</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I silently nodded, and Really thought about his words. I was his mate That Kiss Proved that. I really did get the connection I wanted. When I got a chance, we would talk more about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as it was, now that he wasn&#39;t in here, the sadness of the unicorn magic came back. It was strange being like this for no reason. They used the magic in the first place because of Kaizen anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being his mate held a lot of power that I should have flexed at that Meat Market The vampire might not have bewitched me. The panda shifter might have been nicer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I also understand it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why be nice to someone who&#39;s going to die?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They also saw me as as food</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As cruel as a place like that was how Terrible that there were humans bred on farms to be turned to hamburgers. That if it wasn&#39;t there, I assume they would still need to get the meat somehow That meat kept the things that go bump in the night. Bumping somewhere else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of all the things that I didn&#39;t remember I remembered that the place was spotless. And the people were clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swear I saw enormous wolves in the trees. It stopped my train of thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was No way. But I also heard people talking. I couldn&#39;t understand the language, but I know one of them yelled at the other. I didn&#39;t See these men, but I knew they were here, probably at the crappy rest stop, arguing that they should have paid more money to be somewhere else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They left before Kaizen came back. As a monster to the other monsters, I assumed they were just scared off by him. He wasn&#39;t his full size or anything, but I&#39;m sure they knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got in the car and pulled around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t get a double-bedded room. So we&#39;ll have to share.&#34; He said nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re adults, we can just put a blanket between us.&#34; I said seeing him nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, that&#39;s not happening.&#34; He said getting out once we parked in front of 143, and he opened the door for me. There was a large king bed in there, a Tv, and a bathroom.. &#34;It&#39;ll help with your sadness.&#34; He said opening the door for me too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This place was a dump. I&#39;d had my fair share of cheap motels while traveling because I didn&#39;t have a lot. but this was by far the worst one. &#34;I assume they didn&#39;t ask for ID or anything.&#34; I said with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope.&#34; He said getting both our bags. I didn&#39;t know he had any luggage He also brought in the cooler too That was what made me kind of freak out. He plopped it on the floor, since there wasn&#39;t a fridge</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran into the shower after I snagged some stuff from my bag. I was in there at least an hour, washing my hair and scrubbing the memories away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t work, but it didn&#39;t stop me from trying. When I changed and got in bed, he went into the small bathroom... I&#39;d used the only towel, but if he needed one, I might have a clean one left. I had almost an anxiety about sharing a bed with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe we could go back and try to get a bigger room. They looked pretty sold out though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do bite, but not too hard.&#34; He grinned, wiggling his eyebrows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh shut it.&#34; I complained squealing when he leaned forward. &#34;Ah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook the bed with his weight, getting in with me. He was Too close but it felt nice. I found myself having my worries washed away. I should have resisted feeling this good from his company, but I hugged him. He pulled the sheets over top us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you never mark me if we are to stay in one moment, let it be this.&#34; He said flipping me around, so my face was on his bare chest He was in just sweats. I could see the Horned One&#39;s symbol on his belly button. A circle with horns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen&#34; I said sheepishly Why wasn&#39;t I resisting.? He was-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know I&#39;m hard, but let me have this.&#34; He hissed. &#34;It&#39;s hard not to be. A temptress is in my bed.&#34; He snickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re hot yourself.&#34; I said pushing him away playfully. I could tell he let me but I could Also tell that he never took his hands off my waist</p>
                
                
                
                <p>God his touch lit me on fire His playful gaze told me he&#39;d heard me.. but his loosened hold also told me he wouldn&#39;t try anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodnight little mate.&#34; He yawned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodnight big mate.&#34; I said relenting to this feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went to sleep with him being the big spoon I&#39;d never experienced that before True affection, not just a façade because they want to get with me. He said nothing. He was already asleep</p>
