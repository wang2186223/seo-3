                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited for Hank to bring the prisoner, but in the short hour that I waited gods I was spoiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why&#39;d I have to be here on business!&#34; I complained I was being spoiled *rotten*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were no pups here to puppy so I was grandma&#39;s little piggy-pig. She had steak to stuff me. And I was stuffed. I was a fatted cow ready for slaughter, but it did not stop her. And I could make room for the extra treats she pulled out the oven. The homemade cookies steamed. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d had peanut butter cookies before, but they smelled Amazing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got hugged by Grandma Eclipse, she was no bigger than Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know! It&#39;s always business Next time come with everybody.&#34;  She gave me cookies and made me sit on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got to hear about everything that happened since the last I visited. Uncle Connor learned the guitar, Aunt Shelly picked up, and became fluent in unicorn. Michelle, Hank&#39;s older sister, is now Beta of LemonMoon, the northern border of Charred. They&#39;re only about 50 miles away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That prison is the biggest in the country now for supernatural creatures. They used to just house wolves and stray humans, even the illegal HeadHunters, but now every race has at least a few of their ranks there. It was maximum security, with clean, state of the art cells for inmates, and apartments for regular humans. Mortals who resist mind erasing, or don&#39;t get it in time are sent here, and live their days out in peaceful captivity. Hunters are used for meat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That is how CharredMoon makes the majority of its money The former Crown Prince was said to rule with an iron fist, but I only knew him as &#39;the coolest grandpa&#39; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had to see him fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got the asswipe!&#34; Shouted Hank outside. He looked like the King as well, though his eyes were blue most of the time. When pissed, he could make them kind of purple, since his wolf&#39;s eyes are red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Congratulations on finding a female who you can trust./ I shot a quick link to him. Now wasn&#39;t the time to talk about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Thanks. Next year, Keith is going to have a pup too. They&#39;ll be technically half brothers. We&#39;ve adopted two pups, Warrior Gynni, and Warrior Ingrim are 25 now, what&#39;s two more./ He linked happily. I didn&#39;t know that. I need to keep up with family affairs more often.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless that was the only links we&#39;d share. I had to get back to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t mind my softening him up a bit do you?&#34; I asked grandma; she&#39;d probably be the only one upset by this. She was probably the smallest, sweetest wolf I&#39;d ever met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do what you have to.&#34; She said surprising me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; I grabbed the wolf by the scruff, and decided the back yard was better than the hardwood of the house. He wasn&#39;t shifted, in clean white inmate clothing, but now it was covered in grass stains, soon to be blood too if he didn&#39;t talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wolf was a Shadow Warrior That pack, every member, is born without the full moon on purpose. They use techniques to birth their pups without the Lady&#39;s grace, and it gives them the ability to step into the shadows easier than a normal werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was no different, sporting the signature mix-matched eye combination of one blue eye, and one brown. Heterochromia was only present in wolves who could use the pseudo magic and it seemed I gathered a bit of a crowd even the elders wanted to see this. It&#39;s rare wolves age, but for those that do, their long lives hold much value.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What were your orders?&#34; I asked. &#34;Only Council can employ Shadows, and I know you let yourself be caught.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will tell you nothing.&#34; He hissed. This one held pride in his heart</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled. It made some of the wolves&#39; hair bristle. &#34;Do you know how much time I have to extract this information?&#34; I asked this letting my claws sheath and unsheathe. I let one graze the top of his forehead as I knelt in front of him. I let our eyes meet. I let him see a vision of what the Layer of Murder looks like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked *Terrified*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I ask you again how much time do you think I have to get the information I want mortal.&#34; I growled. I let him have a Taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let him see my penance for the world around us, only a few seconds passed, about 25. But he got to see all 25 years Every death experience all the hurt. That was what was in store for him, being an assassin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. eternity sir.&#34; He mumbled. &#34;Eternity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; I patted his head. &#34;Ink and Tiptap, a strange name for man and wolf. Tell me or you *will* tell me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; the 13th seat sir When you killed the 14th Seat Lupe, Lord Cunnings&#34; He stopped himself. &#34;I have now broken my oath an additional crime.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m taking you to the castle. You will tell details but you seem useful.&#34; I said standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could teach Jack the secrets of ShadowMoon There were some Shadow Warriors in Misfit, but they didn&#39;t know what this one did His eyes weren&#39;t as blue and brown. This was a highly ranked one. A lieutenant.  His talents would be wasted in torment</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I disappeared with him, and I couldn&#39;t drag him through hell. Grandfather would want to keep him since he held the red X on his soul. So, I had to teleport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods I hated magic</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just kind of knew how to do it and I did. I wanted to vomit from the movement from one country to another, but I deemed this worth it. I played it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Court was not in session, so the throne room was empty since it was only about noon. But on seeing the Broken Shadow with me, the guards were stirred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lord Kaizen.&#34; Bowed Shakira. Now that I wasn&#39;t a fugitive, she, and all the royal gaurd gave me as much respect as she would the King. They kneeled on bended knee, almost afraid for my appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fetch my brother and the council who are here do not let Thad Cunnings leave the palace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course sir.&#34; Said Shakira, the Royal Hiena Guard Captain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In about three minutes, every council member was there, though the only one who looked nervous was Cunnings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then my brother came in the room I must say I could understand why they feared him so badly. He looked almost older than me with how stern he looked, holding an aura that radiated small balls of gold mixed with darkness. The lights were stolen by his aura, and his candle&#39;s flame between his horns was gold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was in only jeans, barefoot, and his true height. As he walked past me, I said nothing, but I gave the smallest nod. He returned it. &#34;Brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother. I bring information.&#34; I motioned the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way the throne room was made, was that there were 14 Seats, each throne held the family colors of each house, with Tyson&#39;s seat in the center. His was black and gold The long, black marble table in front of them had a brass nameplate of their names and rank. Above their heads was a mighty banner of each house&#39;s crest and the 14th seat was now permanently empty. It sat high on steps, that they looked down on us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Court is in session. I Tyson, King of the Wolves, acknowledge my dear brother. Speak.&#34; He waved his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Kaizen, 1st General of the Horned One present a traitor. He was ordered, and sworn to serve. Sworn to secrecy but he breaks his vow for his King.&#34; I motioned Ink to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no house nor last name I am simply known as Ink. I have lived too long, and know too much. I speak as a servant assigned to the 14th Seat With his words, I was ordered to sneak in to the nursery and steal the pup of his majesty. Though I allowed myself to be captured. The Crown Prince is the most precious thing in this castle more than gold, more than any gem, I could have stole the crown it sits on a pillow in the vault, and I have a key, yet instead I broke my oaths and ran like a dog. I will die like one too, but I will die, go to hell, and be punished without the prince&#39;s blood on my hands.&#34; He said this looking Tyson in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mother sat in the 3rd seat She looked stern, steeled like an Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did he make this plot.&#34; Asked Tyson, resting his knuckles on his cheek. His eyes were like mine, black and red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After Lupe was killed. Cunnings wanted revenge But they also wanted to get into the Vault, to steal the heart of the King, and give it to the 12th seat, Yul Thompson, that he may sleep forever. They were going to do all this at the same time, to force his majesty to forge a similar deal. A deal like the one Brutus had He gained that through kidnapping the original 3rd Seat&#39;s mate&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tyson the King, more like the Zealot!&#34; Yelled the 12th seat. &#34;You are so *good and righteous* yet we do what must be done without question!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Collect Cunnings and Thompson Shakira.&#34; Said Tyson. &#34;I will behead them myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! HE LIES!&#34; The 13th Seat screamed as the hyena shifters grabbed the arms of the two councilmen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were put in the center of the room, in front of the Shadow and myself. I said nothing, and watched. He got up slowly, with the flame flickering between his horns. It could not hide how livid he was If only his face could be seen one would think he was fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke as he walked from the center of the table. Not a head was lifted Our anger could likely be tasted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not like my grandfather. I do not have patience for traitors. Had you taken my son, as the 3rd General of Hell, I would have killed every wolf, every man, every woman, every child, every Cow, Every Horse, Every Blade of Grass, Every Fucking Fly that Buzzes around the Cow&#39;s SHIT on your farms. Then I would take my son, and we would watch what was left burn. Nothing would grow there ever again. Never again will you be allowed to live. That is my sentence: Death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He summoned a sword and shield. The sword was a black steel longsword, thin and wide, about 5 feet long. The runes on it were orange, as it was a mixture of red and gold. His shield was ornate. It showed the Horned One in all his glory, though the black iron also glowed orange..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were made to kneel The swing of his sword made a swoosh that could be felt as he beheaded the 13th Seat. There was no hesitation there was no mercy. His head rolled, and wasn&#39;t done rolling. He beheaded the 12th seat, and both their heads stopped once it hit the left wall of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you.&#34; He pointed his blade at Ink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want this mortal.&#34; I said stepping in front. &#34;He broke his oath for us, I think it fair I give him my blood, so he is forever bound.&#34;</p>
