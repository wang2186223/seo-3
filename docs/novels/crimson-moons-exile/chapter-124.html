                <p>a/n: lol this edit is brought to you by Man-O&#39;s, your choice for the best moral prefromance! Now containing 20% less keratin!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah yes, such a beneficial transaction.&#34; Said grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked much happier about this than he let on. &#34;I will be back come sunrise, and I have sent Apythmenos to ensure your wife is cared for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pups would only age a day the way grandmother adjusted her realm. This is probably the only way this would have worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let it be known that the King of Hell is fair.&#34; I said with a small bow. He&#39;d done me a favor, a double one at that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You aren&#39;t slick.&#34; He said with a grin. &#34;I see your heart, you little shit. Go have fun and get drunk. Waste your time alone when you could have her down here with you a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that he vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only was he taking the boys on a playdate with their grandmother, but time in her realm matched Urth He gave me 3 days of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were going to be in the Moon realm while I cracked open a beer. I gave the humans the day off. It came to my attention that they didn&#39;t know about the work regulations down here. They are legally required to have off time as employees of Tarteron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could get fined for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, to make sure they got paid, and they had off time, I pulled a favor from Slah-hesh&#39;Ra. He&#39;d make sure they got paid on time, and since he was a Layer Lord, he had permission to send me invoices. I could then pay said invoice through the Bank of Tarteron I also made a work schedule and salary designation for them, so that even if they took off personal days, their pay wouldn&#39;t suffer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though I&#39;m still fucked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually I will have my own unit down here, and their housing, pay, and training will be my responsibility. But until then, I would milk this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which reminded me Before I have fun I have to contact the Lord of War. What could he possibly want with me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----The Horned One----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get back here!&#34; yelled Lulliba. The moment I put them in her silver fields, they *ran* as *fast* as their little legs could go. It also helped that this is the spirit world; the gravity is a bit lighter. There&#39;s no flesh to push down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Ma!] They yipped happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s your big ma.&#34; I chuckled. I figured to teach them a new word, if only to have something to call us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Big ma!] they shouted, running around her in a big circle, then screaming, running behind me when they saw her Herold, Grindel their other grandfather. They&#39;d never seen wolves so big.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One day you will match his size.&#34; I said picking them both up. I held them to my chest Lulliba was *so* jealous I felt the smallest taste of guilt and let her hold them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[. May I?] Asked Grindel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need no permission from me.&#34; I said casually. His tail today was unsure, as he&#39;d raised his pups before, though these were different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were smaller, and already had their powers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sniffed them; now that they were in their grandmother&#39;s arms, and my presence, they were calm, bold even. That made me proud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[May they never know pain.] he said giving them such a powerful. Dangerous blessing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have not done a good thing Howling One.&#34; I said not wanting to, but ultimately leaving such a blessing on them, almost a curse. Mortals who do not feel pain with this much power It will be up to Kaizen to *really* keep them in check, or I will have to cull them myself should they prove disobedient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That is why we should not become attached to mortals. Their lives are Short. Fragile. I cannot stay even a day on the mortal plane, as my breath is enough to destabilize its rotation. I wouldn&#39;t do that on purpose, but I have as of yet to figure out how to fix it without stuffing myself in either flesh or piloting an avatar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[I do not understand master.] He bowed his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I petted it. Grindel was the softest wolf she ever made, because he used to keep her company Little Lulliba has always been afraid of the dark, and not being there for her on those nights still even now makes me feel less of a man That I should have just taken her back That I should have destroyed my half for her, all of it, as I threatened to do, but didn&#39;t because she begged me not to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is not good that mortals do not know pain. Pain, both emotional and physical hurt for a reason. It is needed. It teaches lessons no mortal would learn organically Fire is hot, ice is cold holy magic is *meant* to burn. Harsh words make few friends. You have blessed them, but it will not stop their injuries. So now I must add to your blessing.&#34; I grumbled this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Let me Zuzu.&#34; She smiled. I absolutely *adored* that nickname, but I wouldn&#39;t show it. I stoically nodded, bending low for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lulliba put her hands on my chest, resting it over my belly button. I was given the pups again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tiny flesh of mine. Hear the blessing of your grandmother. I bless you that even though you don&#39;t feel pain, you know and understand it&#39;s automatic, instinctual nature. That if you stub your toe, that if you touch a priest, that you understand that it should hurt, and you will be injured that if you play with someone&#39;s feelings, that you understand the gravity of them shunning you, or leaving. Is that right?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s good.&#34; I said with a nod. &#34;I bless them as well.&#34; I said waving my hand over them. I reinforced Lulliba&#39;s blessing, as she is much weaker than I. &#34;May they hold a virtuous heart, and wield their power with honor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Double blessings How I *cheated* but technically my mate&#39;s blessings had two parts so technically I needed to balance them. Words hold power, but none more than mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So much magic on children so small put them to sleep. I cleaned them with magic, and I would let them have their naptime. My mate finally had a small house built, a circular cabin in her woods. The house was silverwood, a kind of oak made of actual sterling silver. The wood grew, holding a grain pattern that couldn&#39;t be matched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The outside of the home was round, as the house was a wooden yurt instead of a canvas tent. It held no corners, and the roof was conical, being oxidized silver tiles. Her round windows and half-circle double doors were connected to a round covered porch that ringed the entire house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the full circle entrance with the two crescent handles I liked that touch as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I loved the dark rings and texture of the sterling wood I was thinking I&#39;d ask for a few leftover planks to make an end table in the throne room. It would match nothing, but I&#39;d always have a small part of her world on mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, it was made to look like a 90&#39;s style apartment, one of her favorite time periods. She liked the look of Victorian as well, but she flipped a coin. To be fair, I liked the almost ACQUAINTANCES aesthetic. Specifically Phebe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was made to be one big communal room as well, thus the description of a &#39;yurt&#39;. It was unique and unlike any of the other castles of the other gods that I&#39;d seen. It was homely, yet large enough to house 200 people easily. The silver and blue tapestries were accented by either oxidized or polished silver trim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each section of her home was its own &#39;room&#39;. Each carpet on the floor was a different pattern depending on the area. There was tile for the kitchen and bathroom; that section had a wall made for privacy. The furniture in here held her mortal clothes, and the TV on the nightstand had a blue flame fireplace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get why she did that. With magic, one could adjust the temperature of the house with it. It would eternally burn the silver logs in there, making no smoke since it isn&#39;t made of carbon. There was a section for the bedroom sectioned off with silver sheer curtains. They become blackout dark with a little magicimpressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love this.&#34; I said laying down on her bed, a giant pillow that could accommodate my 14-foot frame She did that on purpose, the cheeky goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know why you&#39;re smiling.&#34; She sang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laid flat, testing it out, and I didn&#39;t dangle off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.Dear did you make this?&#34; I asked putting the pups gently between us, and they slept on a smaller pillow. She&#39;d come to lay down with me, and we 4 snuggled together. This was nice. I very much enjoy having a mate. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t reject the idea like Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It reminds me of when I&#39;m home.&#34; She admitted. &#34;This is my home too I must maintain this realm, but if I could stay Below with you every night I would.&#34; She hugged my neck. I leaned over to let her do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anywhere you are is home. I don&#39;t need anything.&#34; I said content. I found a remote, and we picked a mortal show from a world she wouldn&#39;t know about. I picked Earth, because why not. We watched a wolf documentary, which she cried when one of them died, and I had to console her that it would be fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she asked, I&#39;d have fetched it for her to dote on and pet but I&#39;d given her SO many animals rabbits, bears, deer, horses, gorses, geese, ducks, lions, a fucking tiger whose fur was made of garnet. It was a dark purplish red with black stripes and I can&#39;t forget the fucking fat beaver, the reason why she has a lake in her forest instead of a river. The 500 pound creature was about 8 feet tall, and stopped up the river I made since I fucked up that gift</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the beaver keeps and runs a damnso it isn&#39;t all bad. It&#39;s energy is used to crush silver for cloud linings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you so serious husband?&#34; She asked quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just thinking how I messed up your river. How&#39;s Bucktooth?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still can&#39;t believe he can chew through solid silver.&#34; She mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made his teeth high carbon steel&#34; I mumbled back. &#34;This is lovelyI was thinking I&#39;d made a link between our realms if you&#39;d like that?&#34; I didn&#39;t mean to blurt out such an intimate question, but she jumped on top of me, burying her face in my robes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you?!&#34; She actually started crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would have already done it, if I knew you would react this strongly.&#34; I said petting her hair. All it took was a wave of my hand. Now her realm was part of mine proper. I had 5 to monitor. It honestly does not matter. Anything for Lulliba All she has to do is ask.</p>
