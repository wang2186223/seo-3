                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The arena they had was small compared to anywhere I&#39;d ever fought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flickering florescent lights were dim, as if this place was not as maintained as other Red Rooms I&#39;d seen like it. They had them at places where Alphas met. I would accompany Tyson, or come as a representative on OpalMoon&#39;s behalf, but nothing compared to the Circle of Challenge back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually, the pack would hold a large field maintained by the pack in the woods but here here was a community center. In the basement underneath, was a concrete room painted a dingy white. As a wolf, I could still smell so much old, painted over blood as if at one point this place was an illegal fight ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wasn&#39;t impossible as many elite Rogues of all walks of life lived here in luxuryeven a few humans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am here to challenge. I am Gilbert the Lycanthrope.&#34; He said ripping off his clothes, not yet shifting. There was a bloodthirsty look in his eyes as he glared at me. &#34;I Have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mortal form, he was a proud, head shaven, dark skinned man that almost reminded me of the Second Seat, Lord Ronitus the Earthen One. However, he held no bastard children, and only one living son. He smelled at Most 80, but I knew John. Ronitus&#39;s son was mated to my aunt they only had the one son together and John was probably as noble as my brother He would have no bastard children</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Gilbert carried the similar earthy scent to him though There was a possibility that he could be a distant relative but that was not likely either. The Great War killed so many supernaturals that entire species were wiped out and entire bloodlines. As far as Anyone knew, even the Second Seat, Ronitus was the Last of his original pack. The only others who carry &#39;Earthen One&#39;, were his son John and his grandson Harry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assume you want this fight to the death.&#34; I said sternly. I also took off my clothes and shifted, being the same height as him. They stood taller because they weren&#39;t on all 4&#39;s like a regular werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lycans were Rare as it is a recessive trait in werewolves. And they are loners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lycans generally don&#39;t, or rather Can&#39;t join packs they Can&#39;t control themselves around man&#39;s meat either They oftentimes lacked a human enough mortal form to blend in with the populus. Though at the same time, since they had no inner wolf, they often didn&#39;t fit in with other pack wolves Nor did they tend to heed the words of their Alphas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked on two legs, and their arms were a little longer, so they galloped on all 4&#39;s kind of like a gorilla. This one was no different. He shifted, revealing a medium brown fur with a dark brown spotted pattern on his back like a hyena, though he had only a slightly fluffy bob tail. I didn&#39;t know if they weren&#39;t born without them sometimes, or if he lost half of it in a fight. It was just a small nub there, and it wagged in a nervous excitement that stopped. He raised it too high for my liking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[As custom, I will not use my powers] I said proudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[If you kill me, I thank you for the rest. If you defeat me, I will follow you.] He said charging me with brown eyes, the same incredibly rare wolf&#39;s eye color that Ronitus had</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was like me He had no inner wolf. and it was a shame to kill so much potential. A wolf that when he grappled me with his lycan clawed hands, he was actually strong enough to resist the serrated bite of my fangs. He had to use all his might to do it, but he also Actually broke my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That confirmed it. He Was of some noble bloodline. He bit me with all his might, and cracked my collarbone. I could hear the click, though I slashed him across his chest He winced in pain, but would not let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to half shift my paws to fingers to pry his mouth open, and with myself free, I did not hesitate to lunge at him with all my force, and break his arm with my headbutt. To remain fair, I would not release my horns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was for honor after all</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shared no words with me He was as mindless as an animal This is what happens when grandmother blesses someone with strength in body, but not enough strength of mind to know who they are or what they&#39;re doing like how I killed my fellow packmates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was disoriented, as I used his pain and madness to get a hold of his neck, and I clamped down. He thrashed around, getting my side pretty good. Blood splattered across the dingy walls, but I used my strength, all of it since he writhed so much all I had to force submission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got me across the gut, and I shifted my arm to be human enough to hold my skin together but he screamed like a mixture of animal and man He left deep gashes in the ground that turned to sand, and a lot of dust was kicked up from his frantic attempt to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should behead him here and now though I held him still. I didn&#39;t know if that was the Right answer. I didn&#39;t know if grandmother sent me this man to add to my ranks or to test my resolve in my conviction to repent</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the Tootie-fruity fuck.&#34; Said one of the pack wolves who watched I hadn&#39;t noticed the crowd until now</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They could not believe the intense Hatred he held the strength it took to hold him down. His thrashing made my arm bone crack, then flex. Then break.I had to switch hands. But I held him still</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On my honor, I would not heal. I would not mend anything so long as we were engaged in fair combat. If I let go, he would slash his way out of here and run away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As only the wolf, I knew that was what he was thinking as only his instincts right now</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kill him!&#34; Someone Shouted. I didn&#39;t know who, but it wasn&#39;t Ace or Jack. I know he was already gone by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why hadn&#39;t I killed him? I had him by the throat, while my good paw held him down. He may not be affected by me as much as a normal wolf, but I still had the upper hand. All I&#39;d have to do is adjust myself and slice his veins. The left arm was numb. It was a really bad break too; I could tell it was close to the shoulder. It was limp now, holding no feeling to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel my innards try to escape</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weakness</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Lycan passed out with a submissive whineIt was one that acknowledged me as Alpha but he bled slowly on the floor</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I decided for now not to kill him.&#34; I said shifting to a mortal form again. I scooped a palmful of my blood, and put it in his mouth I would make him my pack whether he wanted it or not. &#34;Put him in a holding cell and let me know when he wakes up.&#34; I said walking to the exit stairs, and supernaturals parted way for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shouldn&#39;t have Made him pack like that, but by my blood, he would obey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were looks of fear and distrust as my horns were out now and the glow around me told me the small candle&#39;s flame between them showed who I was. I healed as I walked it Hurt fuck did it hurt, but I used my powers so I could still be of use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me starving I went from powering All the way down, to the point of being able to be harmed by mortals, to using my inner strength to heal myself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damnit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lost a bit of blood, and my liver hurt, but I would be fine come sundown I was a child of the Night and tonight was supposed to be moonless. A fresh kill would fix my hunger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who saw the fight heard the pops and clicks of healing They saw how straight I walked as if my arm wasn&#39;t dangling only moments ago</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he come here a few days sooner... all those people would have been attacked and their homes displaced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those dragon guards at the gate would not be able to stop a Lycan With Royal Blood. And when this one shifts, he has no awareness of who he is anymore it&#39;s Why lycanthropes are so rare other than the recessive genetics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It may be about the same odds as a blue lobster.  But that Wild Mindlessness the madness when you taste blood, or first shift the True nature of only the wolf I&#39;m surprised the Church had not caught him yet but being of royal blood made him likely unable to be contained by a regular priest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think I saw myself in him. Maybe that&#39;s why I did it but my blood was like fathers those who drink it become mine. I&#39;d never tried that on purpose but I knew. It was just an instinctual thing something I didn&#39;t have to think about and knew how to do without training.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Now, since I made Gilbert mine he would die too should I be beheaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I&#39;d made another enemy but what sucks is that Ronitus is old as Grandfather, being the Royal Beta as well as the Second council Seat He was probably the only one fighting for me in the castle His son is mated to my Aunt Heidi, the half witch. I would make bad blood with him and grandpa no not &#39;would&#39; have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I Have made bad blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another wrong, but the lesser of two evils, since there are So Few of Ron&#39;s kind.. Letting him live. Letting him live as a follower of a Horned Wolf it would break Ron&#39;s heart, but I know he would be overjoyed to see a fellow family member.</p>
