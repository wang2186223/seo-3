                <p>*Mature: Sexual content*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A/N: I can&#39;t believe it I have a 60-sided novelty dice at home since I have a horde of D&amp;D dice I rolled a 60 TWICE!!! TWICE !!! HOW COOL IS THAT?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, I will not elaborate on why I rolled it. Heeheeheeheeheee</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held a growl but I wasn&#39;t angry or anything. I think just impatient. Kaizen was gone, but he&#39;d be back soon. I sat outside, watching Eternya dodge Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d learned that holding growls were important, especially if I needed to go out. I held my breath a second. No air, no growl There were other ways too, but those techniques needed an inner wolf to do, like mentally holding their mouth, or telling them to be quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t exactly do that. But since I was home, if I did growl, I&#39;d only get scolded maybe because I&#39;m supposed to be learning to hold them at will. I focused back on Eternya and Jack... They were training, but Jack wasn&#39;t making much progress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three days passed, and there was peace. But in that peace I was a little restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eternya trained all the children in the morning before they went to school, and at noon, he trained any adults. I watched today because I was invited to Plus, Kaizen had to leave for business, so it meant I would be babysat. It was only 1pm; he said he&#39;d be back by 3.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat outside in a lawn chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on Jack. If you want to stab me, you&#39;ll have to do better than That.&#34; Said Eternya. He parried Jack with ease, and sighed when he did get stabbed It was more of a poke. Eternya couldn&#39;t be marred by Jack&#39;s knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There!&#34; Laughed Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;..Gods Mortals are so weak.&#34; Eternya said shaking his head. &#34;Come at me again, and this time use your magic to propel yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you expect?!&#34; complained Jack. &#34;If I try any harder, I&#39;m putting a hole in your chest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then Do It.&#34; Countered Eternya. &#34;Don&#39;t hold back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that permission to do as I please?&#34; He asked pulling out an old, rusted dagger It had a black aura to it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye. Come at me with all your might. If you can cut me proper, I will sharpen your old blade.&#34; Said Eternya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was probably going to get gory..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think I&#39;d seen enough Jack seemed to almost enjoy training so hard.To be fair, he got to slash someone who couldn&#39;t really be slashed. Eternya got to have mock battles with all the minotaur, shifters, and witches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went upstairs. I could still hear them fighting But I didn&#39;t want that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did I want? I wasn&#39;t hungry or anything. It was too soon for a second lunch anyway, I think?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know what you want.&#34; I heard Kaizen growl from behind me He grabbed both my breasts, giving them both a squeeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned into him. Pure Arousal I knew what I wanted now</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re playing dirty.&#34; I said with a smile. I was turned around to face him. He kissed me roughly. It took my breath away, since he held me so aggressively, putting a claim on me as if I were his prey</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t fair!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I&#39;m fair. What isn&#39;t is your scent.&#34; He whispered in my ear. He nearly nipped it with his fangs He was so close My cheeks heated up, and I could feel myself start to get wet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t be in heat or anything I&#39;m already pregnant.&#34; I said looking down, trying to rationalize this. I knew he was right, but his hold confirmed it and my reaction to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yet here I am, already Fully hard by Just the sight of you.&#34; He growled, kissing me roughly, putting his hands over my button through my clothes. My panties were nearly instantly soaked His touch set me ablaze with want I was so ready I nearly wanted to rip off his clothes myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh..&#34; I said as all I could think about now, was his dick in me I wanted him to shove it in, and ride me hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you keep thinking like that, I will.&#34; He growled in our kiss, ripping my shirt with his claws. The door was open, but he didn&#39;t care I cared about his lips attacking me, while his hand caressed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was carried to the bed the last three steps to it and roughly thrown on it. I helped take off my pants and panties. The shirt was clawed off fully now by his impatience .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He growled again. It had no meaning, but I knew it was pure lust and menace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put his fangs away to attack my button And I writhed like a doe in the arms of my wolf. He was wild, hungry I could see him pumping his cock through his jeans with his free hand It was so big that the head of it was already peeping out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen inserted three fingers in me, and pumped them with the force of an Alpha I opened my legs wide for him... I didn&#39;t want to wait to be wet enough I wanted him Now. &#34;Take me Kaizen.&#34; I said arching my back. &#34;Fuck me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to tell me twice.&#34; He said pulling off his pants, flipping me around and putting himself in me doggy style I was wet enough already, and feeling him go in made me cry out in pure pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was hard and fast, fucking me on his knees on the bed, holding my hips in the air to give him more force I gripped the sheets, moaning loudly while he bred me like a cow. He was so big that I felt every inch of him gliding inside my soaked core like a professional swimmer. He snarled going harder, cumming in me with so much force that he flipped me around, and picked me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wrapped my legs and arms around him like an octopus, and he didn&#39;t slow down, nor stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah.&#34; He said with a strained face. He was still cumming, and I could feel the forceful pumps of his cock while the slaps could probably be heard outside</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t cum yet, but he bit my mark holding me in the air like that. I was folded in half like a piece of paper, and I was fucked hard enough to swear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit!&#34; I yelled at the top of my lungs, feeling the tingles and sparks so intense, that I pulsed around him, but he didn&#39;t stop. He knew I wanted more  He knew that I wouldn&#39;t be sated until I couldn&#39;t gyrate my hips with his rhythm He put my ankles on his shoulders, and pressed me against the headboard</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now his force made me &#39;oh&#39; with each slap... I was going to cum a second time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I really was in heat</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More.&#34; I panted, and he bit harder with a snarl, pumping harder too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[I&#39;ll hurt you.] He warned in wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can take it.&#34; I protested. &#34;Fuck me Kaizen. Fuck me like a toy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He used the headboard of the bed to thrust into me so hard I  could feel him hit the wall of my insides. It cracked behind the force of his thrusts but I didn&#39;t care about that. We&#39;ll fix it later. Right now, the only thing I could think of was how good he felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I climbed a steep hill one that was so pleasurable, all I could do was close my eyes. My button was hit with every insert every pull out felt like miles, only to be shoved into again I made fox noises this time. His bite was tingling it gave its own sadistic pleasure I could feel myself get tight. I was so tight around him that I almost could make out how far inside he was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was getting fatigued with so much but it was worth the explosion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck.&#34; Snarled Kaizen, and I snarled with him when I came</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I came so hard with him, that he held me, pulsing with me And pulling out, he was pretty much empty All he had was put in me, and I was spent but I still wanted More.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both looked at the crack in the wall you could see the office through it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit well let&#39;s get the sheets off the bed&#34; Said Kaizen sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And um... we should probably text the construction crew after it doesn&#39;t smell like heat&#34; I admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed. &#34;I mean I&#39;m pretty sure the whole town heard those yips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut UP!&#34; I yelled, hitting his arm playfully I wabbled a bit when I walked to the bathroom and he laughed at that too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could carry you.&#34; He sang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can Walk.&#34; I complained. &#34;I bet they heard the slippy-slaps too.&#34; I said with a grin. I grabbed his cock and he hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There will be more in the bathroom if you keep that up.&#34; He warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Who said we&#39;re making it to the bathroom?&#34; I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh?&#34; He said excitedly. I led him to the bed this time, and he pretended I could throw him on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed the door. &#34;You&#39;re Trapped in here with Me.&#34;  I grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not running away.&#34; He said happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I craved him. I really did. We&#39;d gone through so much, maybe the stress made me heat again. It didn&#39;t matter; I didn&#39;t care  His kiss gave me literal tingles running straight to my core It was already ready to go again I couldn&#39;t wait to be mated one more time Just one more.</p>
