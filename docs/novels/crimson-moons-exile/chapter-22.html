                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The party provided me with an additional truth one I didn&#39;t want to admit one that I had to admit to myself regardless</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I Needed that meat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d lost a bit of weight last time I shifted since the flame uses my energy not too much, but enough to tell me that as a &#39;monster&#39;, I needed a steady supply of a large amount of food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she sees me amuses me. I caught myself smiling at that again. I Should be offended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You alright Alpha?&#34; The one who sat next to me now was my Beta, Ace. My Gamma would be Jack while we were in the living room mostly to ourselves, I would formally address him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Omega Valery as well as the pups were in the living room, but they were watching the news to pass time, and also likely to digest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no packhouse office here, but this kitchen will do.&#34; I said getting all their attention It seemed even the other Rogues who swore to me earlier even a few goblins wanted to hear my order should I give it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before we start I need to come clean about something sir&#34; Said Ace, but I stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Know you are from Brutus&#39;s line Brutos, of the House of Finnand.&#34; I said calmly. &#34;It&#39;s written on your soul.&#34; I said truthfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like he saw a ghost. The rest of them looked at each other as if I were a monster well even among monsters, my people were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have anything to do with them. They Contact Me.&#34; He said firmly, but honestly shaken that I&#39;d said the traitor&#39;s name so casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s Brutus?&#34; Asked a goblin. They weren&#39;t wolves, so they wouldn&#39;t know. Most wolves wouldn&#39;t either now that I thought of it, since the Wolf Court was a myth until I think about a hundred and fifty to two hundred years ago. The old wolves liked their privacy, and let themselves vanish into legends and tales for their own piece of mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was why Grandfather slept. Why my brother&#39;s paw was firm iron why if he had his hands on me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that I have a mate I Cannot leave her alone in this world May we never cross again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brutus was the former Third Seat of the Wolf Court, the one who ruled before my mother. My father killed and skinned him alive after he perceived him as a threat. He also sent his pelt to the True Third Seat, the Frosted One. The first five seats are meant to hold an elemental wolf however the Frosted One has a human mate Brutus didn&#39;t like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a lot of drama about all this too, but I left that outOriginally, The Frosted One fought alongside the Wolf King They were all as brothers, but even still Phillip was banished. He renounced his title and his pack for his mate&#39;s safety it was how Brutus became the Third Seat. How the legacy of the House of Grisham was made.  I left out how no one trusted Brutus because he was a Snake who gained his seat by threatening Phillips human mate and unborn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also left out that because he tried to threaten us as pups he holds his own special place in hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oddly enough, I vaguely remember being babysat while father killed the rest of Brutus&#39;s line. Being a demigod I don&#39;t forget much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ironic that I, one stronger than even the King also have a human mate That I, for her sake lost all my control, and would again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s more than Just that.&#34; Said Ace breaking the silence. &#34;They were all monsters. My family&#39;s empire was built off the backs of good men and women Supernatural And mortal alike. It Didn&#39;t matter. Their pelts are as slimy as their hearts.They lied, and all who they could not cheat or trick, they found whatever weakness they could But when your father killed the patriarchs of my family, their precious dynasty fellI was too young to remember that well, but you can imagine the way they behave if I left at 15..&#34; He said firmly. &#34;Those wolves don&#39;t behave like a pack there is no loyalty there is no one there you can trust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You tell me this in guilt, but I only see resilience you even left your mate. I assume they either called you about it or convinced you to come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They lured me back. They told me my mate was there. They weren&#39;t lying I&#39;d have come home if not for their schemes and plansAnd she is like Them&#34; He said honestly. &#34;I went back by myself about a month agoThey paid for the plane ticket and everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We told him not to go, but they promised him money too. He came back not himself.&#34; Said Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then Stop beating yourself up, find a mark mate to soothe the pain and move on here with us.&#34; I said firmly.  &#34;That goes for all of you. I do not care about your past actions. I care about what you choose to do Now Granted I can&#39;t make an official pack, but I Can offer the protection one provides.&#34; I said seeing many of them nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I may not be a real Beta but I know enough.&#34; Said Ace. &#34;I swear I&#39;ll be a second you can be Proud of.I Left my pack fuck them.&#34; He grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there anything they&#39;re doing or planning in particular?&#34; I asked. &#34;The rest of you, Do not follow.&#34; I said motioning Jack. &#34;If you&#39;re my third, you should hear too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course sir.&#34; Jack said following me to the guest bedroom on my floor one day it may become an office, but there was no room for pups if I did that It was Way too soon to think about it anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now tell me.&#34; I said putting my hand to my temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Frost and OilMoon already belong to the House of Finnand but they have their eyes set on getting back into the court. They plan on using Jang, the Sixth seat.&#34; He said looking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His pack it is empty. He was cursed by my uncle. Treason was his crime the death of his Entire Pack was his punishment.&#34; I warned. &#34;He is not a threat.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No but he has gone mad with all the isolation He speaks to his dead wife as if she&#39;s there... He wears a scrap of her fur on his wrist To be honest sir he might do whatever my cousin wants.&#34;  Ace was really quiet, but I could hear Why he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was also why he was so sure, but I wanted him to say it out his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak.&#34; I commanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once I got there I&#39;d almost accepted my mate until my mother started ranting some hairbrained scheme for Martha, my cousin. They want her to marry that crazy wolf but I wouldn&#39;t know why. My mate was the daughter of some investor, and with our bonding he was going to merge his company with OilMoon&#39;s refinery.I don&#39;t even know how they knew we were mates. We were just childhood friends&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was likely their guess then. Also, Jang&#39;s a high enough Council Member number that if she wanted access to the main sleeping chamber of the true Wolf King, no one would immediately question her especially if her name&#39;s changed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What they don&#39;t know is that the True Wolf King Cannot die, but he can be beheaded, have his heart taken or something else. He is my grandmother&#39;s champion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also left out that Tyson would also likely be a target, seeing as how I KNOW his reign is unpopular before it even started. He doesn&#39;t allow corruption after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also, the King never gave his title away by being defeated yet as an heir to a general position in Hell, I don&#39;t know if Tyson, Grace or I are susceptible to a permanent death anyway. The Horned One wants us Here ....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacks claws tapped the wall as he leaned against it He had no issue killing Ace, which meant his loyalty was only for who he saw as his Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Again sir, What do you want done about it?&#34; He asked. Jack looked bored. He only cared about if I would send him to go &#39;fix&#39; this or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.Alpha&#34; Said Ace. His fear made my Gamma grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack was stronger than Ace, yet oddly and rarely enough. He kneeled to him. Jack was the oldest wolf I scented at the party, and I could tell his wolf&#39;s eyes were a dull, non reflective red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed. It relaxed them both. Rick also came in, peeking to see if he needed to plead Ace&#39;s case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You hid this because you feared I would take my anger out on you for your family&#39;s mistakes Ace, or that I would think that you conspire against the Crown with them.&#34; I said calmly. &#34;You are innocent. But I Do need to Do Something. Talking to Tyson is out, it will reveal our location&#34; I said thinking out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made sure to show I had No real emotion on it I didn&#39;t want Ace attacked for my sake. Jack was not as Stable of a wolf as I&#39;d like, but he was loyal as they come. Once he vowed to keep his paws off pack, and to serve me, I knew he&#39;d kill Ace if I asked. This is even though he knew Ace longer probably even considered him a friend</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what can we do about it Alpha?&#34; Asked Jack. &#34;Send me, and I&#39;ll show them why I carry the title of the Slasher.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. This is likely something I&#39;ll have to do myself.&#34; I said realizing why grandfather came all the way from Hell to see me Nothing is ever simple with him. This was likely his test for me to handle</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, you Just announced yourself here as leader. Wolves will flock to this place to be pack. there&#39;s no official pack in this part of the state, not for Miles if you leave to serve that Ungrateful brother of yours, you could lose your mate&#34; Ace said speaking his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t Wrong either. Ace was Beta Strong, meaning there could be a stronger wolf out there</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack hid his potential. But I knew it was on par with me. Well on par so long as I didn&#39;t use my powers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what should I do with this information? If I call Tyson, he Will find the location of this place, and burn it to the ground. If I tell my uncle Xaxas will interfere for Tyson&#39;s sake, but fuck knows when he involves himself in anything, there are Piles of bodies to bury after.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncle Xaxas and father&#39;s involvement would doom the entire pack Uncle Asanguis, the Lord of Death would probably be Just as bad to call for aid</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir you don&#39;t have to worry about how I&#39;ll get there. I Will Discreetly. I already swore off killing just all willy-nilly.&#34; He said excitedly He wanted to be of use to me that was for sure, but I didn&#39;t want to risk it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me Go I Swear I mean it, I SWEAR that I&#39;ll only bring your targets here, un-slashed.&#34; Promised Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cut his hand to oath in blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You realize I am a demigod to swear to me so freely is still binding, much More so than a regular Alpha. Your soul already belongs to grandfather. I know you know that much. But as one of his general heirs, the punishment will be Greater than whatever is due to you at this moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir my soul is fit only for the Pit. You probably see that.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mean he wasn&#39;t Wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Most sinner&#39;s X on their soul is red to indicate they&#39;re a sinner yours is black. Go. Bring me all of Grisham blood, and the 14th Council Member too. Take whoever you think will do well with you I can literally already sense a challenger.&#34; I said scenting a male of Alpha strength on the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know who that is,&#34; Said Jack. &#34;That smells like Gilbert the lycanthrope.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On your way out Jack, tell the guards to open the gate. Also tell them to send someone to show me their challenge location. This place may be run by goblins, but the carnal nature of all the shifters has to be met somehow.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack literally looked like a small child who&#39;d been given bacon. He faded into the spirit world, like assassins do. That technique was not something normal wolves knew, but he scented to be at least . As old as an elder on the Royal Council., plenty of time to learn that on his own.</p>
