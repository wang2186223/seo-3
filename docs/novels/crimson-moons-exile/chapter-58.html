                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got out a taxi wagon pulled by a white centaur going about 50mph There was a small gadget around his neck so he knew how fast he galloped Tarteron&#39;s city was called Repentance, after the Layer it resided on. It was nearly endless, being the place for every soul who either committed a crime and was rehabilitated, or was a victim of the Horned One&#39;s children and grandchildren</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By no means was this a paradise or anything, being Hell and all I just didn&#39;t expect it to be clean and smell like the plant life that lined modern styled, wide sidewalks for 2 way foot traffic, healthy black trees, lamppost street lights, the electricity and phone wires lining them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Roman architecture was also surprising. Statues of not only the Horned One, but his mate and children lined the streets. Some streets were named after them too, but they had to be the spellings he meant, since I didn&#39;t recognize Birrai&#39;shivaal. Maybe that was Mr. Bryson? The stone here was black like the Colosseum, as was the dirt, grass, and the bark of trees in the little squares they were grown in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We went past a park where demons who were off work strolled.. The sky above was blood red, yet the daytime was actually nice I could see why. It felt like a warm spring day, though the breezes here held hot notes to the air. I guess that part couldn&#39;t be helped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blue neon lights were a stark contrast to the red world here, but it was nice to see. People on this layer looked mostly happy. They had jobs, work hours, off days, and even Hell themed holidays to immolate regular life. They celebrated the season changes, though, the ones were nights were longer were more important, especially Lunarween They had posters here and there about the discount in the red district</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;All the fun of the Layer of Sex, without the deviance.&#34; Said one sign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other layers were all terrible and specific, forcing those who committed crimes to confront their wrongdoing, and become rehabilitated for a chance at the Incarnation Lottery. People who wanted to try life again could buy a lottery ticket, and every afternoon at 6pm, those whose tickets turned white were immediately sent off to be born.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was also random. I learned that there were nearly countless words, and there was no guarantee that you&#39;d wind up at your original one, what time period it was, or even if you were born into poor circumstances. It was a Shot for a redo, not a luxury life. At least not a sure fire one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s the palace.&#34; Said Apythmenos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been there before, but I only saw the throne room The black stone castle was huge. It sat at the top of a hill, with the palace grounds flat. No buildings were near it either, as all roads led to that spot. You could even see the worn dark gray cobblestone were people likely made U-turns if they got too close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As &#39;nice&#39; as the Night Father was to me I knew that all this was only because of my standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bottomless One said nothing, but he did hold my hand as I stepped out. It was pretty steep for me. The cart was made for people the size of Kaizen, not someone like me. I was only 130 pounds soaking wet. That centaur had to be at least 9 feet tall. I&#39;d never seen one so buff</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re 134 pounds.&#34; The Herold of the Horned One said smugly. Even though we&#39;d traveled together a few hours, I still couldn&#39;t believe that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha ha.&#34; I said rolling my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least you aren&#39;t on the Layer of Gluttony, starved skin and bones, forced to eat tasteless pottage, or depraved of whatever it was they were gluttonous about.&#34; Apythmenos pointed down, and blew a raspberry. It made the centaur chuckle as he slowly trotted away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I actually saw that while we passed through magic gates to get here Each one had its own horror. It made me cringe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Again sorry. Suffering and all that is normal in my line of work. Sometimes it&#39;s easy to forget how sensitive the living are.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was escorted with heads bowed. The moment they saw Apythmenos, they made way. He paid them no mind, and I followed him silently to the throne room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Horned One seemed in a sour mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want little one?&#34; He asked his herald while his back was turned. &#34;You better not be trying to weasel out of Saturday.&#34; He said gruffly. He stood there, summoning black books around in the air. I could only assume the book he was looking for had something to do with the soul that was chained to the floor, and his lips sewn closed. &#34;Why do I hear curious narration?&#34; he growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. I bring one of your kin&#39;s wives.&#34; He said with a bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Horned One turned around with blazing eyes. &#34;Willow why are you deceased?&#34; He asked with surprise.  &#34;Why does my grandson regenerate from battle? I do not recognize the residue on his flesh&#34; he hissed. His blood boiled as he stood there. &#34;And You, you little shit. Why can&#39;t I find your life?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;M MMM&#39;M MMMMM!&#34; He screamed, being roasted alive by the King of Hell&#39;s left hand over him. The muffling of it wasn&#39;t as bad as seeing him not be able to die from that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That we didn&#39;t know.&#34; Said Apythmenos. He seemed unphased. &#34;May I?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead.&#34; Said the Horned One.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apythmenos kneeled down, and crunched a finger. &#34;I don&#39;t taste anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Every soul has a flavor. Let me see.&#34; He snarled. He took a finger too. They were crunchy it made my mouth water since it smelled like barbeque. And I was a little ashamed of myself. &#34;You may partake here. The Crave curse does not affect you. Trust me, you&#39;ll want sinner willingly..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No thank you sir.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may call me grandfather as the rest.&#34; He said simply, but still clearly pissed. &#34;He has no flavor his book cannot be found. I&#39;m half tempted to throw him into the Pit for wasting my Fucking Time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soul looked at the floor- &#34;Unsew his lips.&#34; I blurted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Little one, you jest?&#34; asked the King of Hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I would never but he looks like he&#39;s getting away with something even though I know he&#39;s really suffering I don&#39;t know why All I know is that nobody killed me, that monster just looked at me and asked me what year it was.&#34; I grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there silent as stone, angered so fully that I bowed low with the Herald.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man caught on fire with black flames This time not even ashes were left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take her home.**** I have somewhere I need to be****.&#34; He snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>------Kaizen------</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean put on shades. Ugh my phone&#39;s all gooey too look at the plastic.&#34; I said waving it at her. She squealed like a little girl. I should feel bad, but a grin creeped slightly across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it or I&#39;ll leave you to be all. Like That.&#34; She said pulling out her phone, taking a picture, and turned it around I looked really bad. My hair hadn&#39;t grown back. I had no eyes. Though the two red dots in their place was unsettling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was regenerating at least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me borrow your phone to call Jack.&#34; I said washing my hands which made skin sluff off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was painful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I willed my way through it to not show weaknessMy people now more than ever would need me to be strong but I&#39;d be lying if I said I didn&#39;t feel all this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dialed for me, and Jack answered the first ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have her like you asked boss.&#34; Said Gilbert. Jack&#39;s got us in the woods with Alavastros. We thought it best to protect him too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. The others are with Flora. Her house is the only one that isn&#39;t trashed.&#34; I complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We also put out the small forest fire with the witches. They&#39;re working hard to save the houses too.&#34; Said Jack. &#34;I have this under control boss. Leave this stuff to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow&#39;s alright right?&#39; I blurted, no longer having the patience to hear other people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She hasn&#39;t woken up, but her heart and breathing are stable.&#34; Said Ace. &#34;I don&#39;t know what he made her eat to fix it, but I know he saved her life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was the poisonous mushroom Devil&#39;s dust.&#34; I could tell Jack was smiling. &#34;Well, if you eat 2 you die I only gave her one and a half.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck Jack.&#34; I sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I may be crazy, but there&#39;s a method to this.&#34; He said seriously. &#34;I could Taste the power from that thing I got a good look too She was too close, and her flesh is too Freshly Turned To Deal with someone like That. The spore dust affects the brain. Calms the heart too if she wakes up tonight, she&#39;ll be . Loopy, but Alive.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t experiment with my master&#39;s mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright I wish you would have found a better solution than that. It&#39;s safe enough to come back. I need to contact my brother.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss I&#39;m not so sure about the kings on this one.&#34; Said Jack His seriousness today was strange. &#34;All of them are the sons and daughters of the originals, merely babysitting thrones while mommy and daddy have a day off They Can die. They will be defeated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.How do you know the Kings&#39; secret?&#34; I asked suspiciously. Even pack members of RoyalMoon didn&#39;t know details on Kings and their ability to revive.. It was a well kept secret, known only by royal officials High ranking ones who fought With them, or witnessed it directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before I was the Slasher, I was Ash&#39;s friend.&#34; He said with a chuckle, referring to King Ashital the Sleeping Wolf King. &#34;I&#39;m barely a wolf, merely the idea of it. Mateless, no sense of pack or a *conscious* bleh.. but I was useful during the war. Dogs like me didn&#39;t get to retire and have a happy ending. We keep killing. Wield me like you would a sharp knife master. The goddess made me this way&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Jack. You did well.&#34; I said giving him a bit of praise, and the line hung up. I&#39;d given him what he needed acknowledgement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack wasn&#39;t like other wolves, that was true Without a mate, nor the desire for one well Killing was his mate. It was his bread too, but he also longed to be recognized as the exception he was. I could bet money if I patted his head, his tail would wag but maybe I might. He saved my mate. She shared my revival ability, but I&#39;m glad she didn&#39;t have to go through that Just because I can&#39;t die does NOT mean it doesn&#39;t hurt.</p>
