                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun was up now, and they were packed. They really did have a small army of pups and women they had in their school bus it was a full sized one, yellow, like the ones mortals use to take their pups to school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The women looked. Fearful of me to say the least. That was normal though I was getting used to the stares All the time before all this it used to be just visitors of the pack, or new people of the royal courts that feared me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were also MORE than what they initially claimed, because they forgot to think of their new addition of some teenagers. About 9 of them. They were all from different packs, from all over the country, spending their last money to have access to the forest part only. They had Just got here, but when they heard someone like me was leaving with a few wolves, they jumped at the chance to beg too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I minded, but I said I didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed getting the last of our things in the car. Willow was already set. She hummed listening to mortal music. I didn&#39;t know what band it was, but it really didn&#39;t matter. What did was that she was happy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hummed in there, not aware that every wolf could hear her sing her &#39;concert&#39;, but no one had the heart to tell her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had a mate I still couldn&#39;t believe it I couldn&#39;t believe she let me finish the process too I even had a cool tattoo of the crescent moon on my neck like my uncles did. Though. since I was a demigod my grandfather&#39;s mark engulfed grandmother&#39;s on both of us. He was now her protector too. Also, the tattoos were a good idea. It would take Much more than a human bite to cut my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck though if it didn&#39;t feel nice for her to try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Boss they&#39;re settled./ linked Ace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Good. Do you have a full tank?/ I linked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/We&#39;ve been running on fumes just to get here. But the kids sold their Beetle and their beat up pickup. That&#39;s four thousand right there / he linked honestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Oh for fuck&#39;s sake. I got a few grand in the back./ I linked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mind linking was something all werebeasts could do, though not all of us are compatible with each other. I can telepathically communicate with wolves around me, but I have had the luck to try with multiple kinds of shifters. Hard to do but possible for Me, probably not for them though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came and I opened the trunk. &#34;Take as much as you need.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked dumbfounded like he&#39;d never seen that much money before oh right they&#39;re commoners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss&#34; He said hesitating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He worried was this a test or trick, but he Really wanted to stuff his pockets. It took all his self control not to. His wolf didn&#39;t trust me, thinking I would pelt them if he touched it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are pack. I won&#39;t have you running out of gas. Oh, and while it&#39;s on my mind, do you have tires?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No sir&#34; he said still not even reaching for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took about eight grand and put it in his hands. It was the most he&#39;d ever held at one time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll stop by a mechanic, get this thing tuned up, then go.&#34; I said casually. This was Nothing for me. It was just money but it seemed for wolves who were young and had little of it their whole life, I was a gods&#39; send.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Thank you boss. I swear I won&#39;t let you down I&#39;m not that strong, but with what I have, I&#39;ll gladly share.&#34; He said nearly running to the school bus. I could hear the screaming and excitement from here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got in my car, my mate&#39;s smile told me she heard too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a good person.&#34; She sing sang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Not. I just don&#39;t really value mortal things. This is a tin can, that&#39;s just paper paper that can buy me more delicious snacks but none as yummy as yo-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shush!&#34; She yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed starting the car. &#34;Use the supernatural Doogle to find a mechanic.&#34; I said stealing a small cheek kiss before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It says there&#39;s one off I-35.&#34; She said happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. It&#39;s on the way.&#34; I said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Do you think the bus can make it an hour more?/ I linked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Yeah. I know where you&#39;re headed. That shop&#39;s run by gnomes. I might not be able to stop there./</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/You ditched on the payment, didn&#39;t you?/ I linked. /I&#39;ll pay that too. /</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hope he heard that sigh</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Thanks boss. / he linked Very sheepishly. I could hear his thoughts from here. While they cheered they had money, he thought I&#39;d skin him. He was Hiding Something what I didn&#39;t know, but with my power I would find out eventually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a son of Brutus&#39;s line He couldn&#39;t have the luxury of secrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was a servant of hell after all, being marked by the Horned One himself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once we left the barrier, I had a feeling I would never be welcome at any elf village again. I didn&#39;t kill anyone, but my snarls at check out might have been heard by Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They insulted my mate, that was honestly what the complaint was. But I lost my temper. I broke the reception desk and caught the lobby on fire by accident. But they shouldn&#39;t have called her a pet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought I was dreaming. I heard everything down there, but I was stupid that I didn&#39;t just Go check on her I initially thought my mark and mating would be enough it wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elves couldn&#39;t smell as well as us, but I KNOW they saw her mark. The Moon Goddess, my grandmother did that it made me want to ask her something</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If ever I die grandmother please watch over Willow Grandfather I know she isn&#39;t one of us, but I don&#39;t I can&#39;t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen are you ok?&#34; She asked. She felt my pain. The literal thought of leaving her to die alone somewhere roused my instincts of sorrow I had physical pain from it. My heart actually hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that I have you, I will never let you go. I worry that now that it&#39;s official my trouble may become yours I don&#39;t think my brother would outright kill you but if you are banished from the human world, and kept a pet, or banished from my world too you Will die and that is Not ok with me.&#34; I said truthfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But.. Kaizen I don&#39;t think anyone is outright after you.&#34; She said honestly. &#34;Like we were at a place ran by elves they probably reported you. maybe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know they did, but the Elf King&#39;s jurisdiction is there. So long as I&#39;m not wanted by the elves too, an officer of the Royal Court can&#39;t just waltz in there, nor a Secret Police Officer without a warrant.&#34; I told her. &#34;Though. I am Banned from such rest points, seeing as how I almost burned down the lobby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what the yelling and screaming was?!&#34; She said laughing. I thought she&#39;d be mad. &#34;I hope they have to close for repairs!&#34; She giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m a bad influence.&#34; I snickered with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;YUP!&#34; She squealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was told to get off the exit, and now all I have within this title would have to work for Ace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their engine sounded about to run out of gas any moment, but I could give it a good push so long as no one paid me any mind on the highway. They likely wouldn&#39;t believe it anyways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The small town was in the middle of nowhere, but it was all supernatural. It seemed by the scent anyway that was kind of neat. This was probably the gnomes den, since all the houses looked well kept and even the little mechanic shop had no grease in their parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled over, and got out, and they smiled. They were all short, 3 foot tall gnomes, but their half supernatural children were about 5 feet tall. Their smiles ended when they saw Ace get out the bus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you with Them?&#34; Asked the head gnome, he wore a red beanie. He was bushy bearded, having dark brown hair with a little gray peppered in. Rare for an immortal, but it meant he&#39;s probably around a few thousand years, at Least over 5.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will pay whatever he owes. They need repairs before we go north.&#34; I said going inside, following him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside, I revealed my horns. I even let the little flame flicker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Light shield us.&#34; He said making the sign of the sun. A small bubble of light surrounded him and all he cared for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woa I mean no harm. I only show my power, that you believe me the first time.&#34; I smiled. I would let him think his magic Could stop me, but to be fair I only had that confidence because of my bloodline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would keep them calmer to just not be an asshole though... &#34;I am Kaizen, the Horned Wolf grandson of the Horned One son of the Beast. I take charge and responsibility for their actions. I know they left with a high tab let me pay it in cash right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Twelve thousand. For the repairs Now and the 5 grand they cheated.&#34; He said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We shook wrists. He had to pop his bubble to do it though. I didn&#39;t want to get burned to be fair</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is a deal then. I may be a demigod from darkness, but I am no cheat.&#34; I said leaving out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll throw in a tune up for your car too.&#34; Said the elder. &#34;I&#39;m Ross by the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know what he said to his fellow gnomes, but I knew it was instructional the way he barked their language. We all got out, and while they fixed up our cars, Ace went across the street to fill up some fairly large emergency gas cans at a gas station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow sat in the lobby with me. I watched WeTube shorts with her. I can&#39;t lie, I loved nonsense and in her feed were jokes. We laughed until she shed tears she was comfortable around me she was terrified of me at first, but it seemed after the completion of the process, any fear of me that remained was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They tinkered on both vehicles for only a few hours, and when they were done, we got back on the road.</p>
