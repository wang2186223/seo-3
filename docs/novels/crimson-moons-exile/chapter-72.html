                <p>chapter!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The energy between us caused a bit of a breeze, but I stood firm in front of my brother. I knew he wasn&#39;t coming with hostility It&#39;s just hard being near someone who was so far beyond me. He was a seasoned Warrior. And I could tell he&#39;d been training the entire time he was dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Uriel, the Glittering One. First Unicorn. Lesser Champion of Lord Arviel.&#34; He said sternly. &#34;I thank you, young ones for your aid.&#34; He smiled, radiating a little light passively</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of curiosity, and honest pride in my people, I let him see mine. I wasn&#39;t quite sure if I&#39;d have one that was grand compared to his, but it took no effort to summon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am the fast one, so I crackle red lightning with my dark aura neat. Grace, the strong one&#39;s aura was pure black, with red ashes that gently floated up. Tyson was too weak to greet the Unicorn King formally, being laid out so poorly injured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear the thorns force him to live by digging into his innards, while Herculian&#39;s soul had been partially sucked. He looked like a muscular raisin With Tyson out, I was the one to introduce us</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Prince Kaizen, Son of Birrai&#39;shivaal, God of Justice, Retribution, and Punishment, grandson of Zuviel. At my left is my sister, Grace, behind me is my brother, Standing King Tyson of the Wolves, and brother in law Aureus, the Mighty One, Dragon King, Son of Saiyatok and Goddess Freeya. And Diana Queen of the Fae.&#34; I said stoically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uriel hummed. &#34;So the rumors of the Wind Goddess is true, though.I have not met the Last-Born Prince of Hell. If he is anything like his children, he is welcome at my side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His handshake burned, but he let go as swiftly as tradition allowed. I did not show weakness by hissing at the pain of it either. They were injured far worse than me. Jerold finally passed out when he got to us, covered in deep gashes that would have any other dead. He was so stubborn I don&#39;t think he would have stopped until he was outright killed to be fair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me wonder. If he was at 100% when he teamed up with us, how hard would he have hit Contradiction. I wish I got to see his initial fight..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get up Herculian.&#34; Uriel hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m dying.&#34; He said weakly, until Uriel kneeled down and flicked him behind the ear. &#34;OW!&#34;  He healed him, but it didn&#39;t look an exactly nice way to do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmhmm. Let the Son of Hell be. I&#39;m sure he isn&#39;t as soft as me anyway.&#34; He joked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t let me touch you.&#34; He complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Naturally.&#34; Said Uriel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Herculian let Tyson&#39;s head lay flat on the flower covered earth while he kneeled slowly He pet my brother between the horns, as if he knew the great secret. That it feels so nice it&#39;s damn near forbidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Who&#39;s petting me? stop it.] Growled Tyson.. He was *actually* in critical condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hardly got to know you wolf, yet I shed tears for your sake.&#34; Said Herculian The enormous musclehead sounded defeated. &#34;There is no more noble thing than to die for a good cause.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even my magic cannot mend this. Intertwined with the Magic of Diana, is a curse laid on him by Contradiction. I think it best he dies.&#34; Said Uriel, kneeling to my brother&#39;s level as well. &#34;This is very unsatisfactory. Master, I don&#39;t understand.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyson managed to let out a single dry laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[.Death is my Uncle. It would be nice.] Said Tyson. He patted the ground three times with his paw weakly, but nothing happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[I don&#39;t want you to.] said Grace completely upset, she likely couldn&#39;t speak English right now She was the strong one; showing weakness wasn&#39;t something she really did. She hugged him, but it only gave him pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Grace. I have no liver, half my intestines, and rose thorns lash what&#39;s left, clinging to me tighter every breath all the while Contradiction&#39;s curse aids in keeping me alive, since it brings me suffering It won&#39;t be forever.] He shifted with a soundless scream. I could see it on his face, but he held his breath to be silent. &#34;I accept my death. Release the spell Diana.&#34; He said proudly, clearly. Like a King. He stood holding his wound It already looked infected, yet it was much too fresh for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you did not ask out your own mouth, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have the heart to do this&#34; she snapped her fingers, and he fell on his hands and knees coughing blood That spell only pauses the inevitable. It gushed out his wound it was so fast nothing would stop that.He couldn&#39;t out regenerate the blow, smelling of Contradiction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another beam struck the ground, but it&#39;s light was mat black It held no shine, as if it was swallowed up..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uriel looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Son of Night, my master holds pity for you It seems he sends his Herold to speak his words&#34; He kneeled low, and the angels landed. They also kneeled on a single bent knee, putting their blades in the dirt, while Uriel released his crystal-clear horn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Halt.&#34; A bubble appeared around him, so he could say his name. &#34;I am Zumitas, the Endless Mountain, the Highest Hight, Herold of the Sun.&#34; Said a curly black haired man in black robes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held a beard that was to his lower chest, and his hair was twice as long. He held pale, almost vampiric skin and dark gray eyes that reminded me of stone. He held black angel&#39;s wings, being a harbinger of death, undefeatable in combat. Instead of elk horns like the Pit, his black halo held spikes. It took the light around it, giving him in general an unearthly black aura. He looked like he should belong in hell</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the Pit is given form, and made to look as a beautiful, trustworthy sight, the gruff scarred male is the Highest Height He was the embodiment of Mount Olympis..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I cannot accept.&#34; Tyson said bleeding out, but unable to die because of the Herald&#39;s presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is appreciated, but we are the direct bloodline of the Void King it would be unwise to rouse his anger.&#34; I said standing tall I would not kneel to him; he was not of my master. Instincts to run or attack were suppressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up, and when he looked back at us, his gray eyes were stern. &#34;My master does not accept this; he feels it is not right a Son of the Horned One dies because of his Son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a point Tyson dying here could still make trouble. He was cursed and killed by a Son of the Sun The King of the Void would be displeased by this as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>but I wouldn&#39;t be able to stop them should Zumitas steal him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ground rumbled, sprouting probably the most aggressive kind of demon grandfather made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with the demons crawling out the ground, being burned slightly by the light of the sun, did not make a single one flinch Grandfather sent as many demons as there were angels and Rah&#39;esh&#39;Kraa&#39;Hraa-Zaimaan, the Lord of Aggression in his human form. The Badger Demon ruled the Layer of Aggression those who were abusive or violent went to his Layer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His appearance looked of African descent, with his black hair with 2 white streaks cut short. He could turn into literally A Giant Fucking Honey Badger, probably The most aggressive animal that comes to mind. He did not know defeat. He would fight until he was killed. Even now, he was covered in small fresh scars and bare chested. He had raised tattoos as well, one for every angel general he&#39;d ever killed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a mighty soldier, likely sent to deal with Uriel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Master Does Not Want Your Filthy Mits on His Children.&#34; He said snorting steam. &#34;Lia lives, now fuck off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Such Vulgar words from such a Vulgar Creature.&#34; Said Uriel, putting his hand on his sword, but not drawing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up before you give me Diabetes, Unicorn.&#34; He spat, and his fellow badgers chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tensions were already High from just the Suggestion of a blessing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your words mean nothing, Layer Lord.&#34; Said Zumitas. &#34;I shall take the boy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will take Nothing, and like it.&#34; Hissed Rah&#39;esh&#39;Kraa&#39;Hraa-Zaimaan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pink beam shook the earth, now all the demons kneeled, putting their swords in the ground</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My master will heal his Own son.&#34; Said Apythmenos, the Herald of Zuviel the world around them felt like Contradiction..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Endless Mountain glared at the Bottomless Pit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they both flapped their wings to hover above the world, that feeling was gone They cannot be at the same time and place. They cannot stand on the same ground, or even breathe the same air it seems. They cast magic barriers around themselves as they shared some unknown, undecipherable conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They say there&#39;s always a bigger fish, well they were more of a great white in a pond. Heralds not only cannot die at All, but they are also meant to stay out of the affairs of any world. They serve their master, being the only entity who could give an unfavorable opinion to their face unfiltered. They hold a closer relationship than even a child or wife with their creator. Seeing a Herald was to hear the words of the pantheon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyson gained Favor with Arviel most likely since Lia was saved. It wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing if not for us being Generals of Hell. Any boons or blessings from an opposing faction CANNOT be accepted. Should he not just die, grandfather himself would likely get involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, because of the dispute, Tyson suffered there lingering in that body It made me angered, but I can&#39;t blame Uriel or the Angels for This.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I Know grandfather. He wouldn&#39;t give us away He wouldn&#39;t let us be blessed by the Lord of Light, since they only truce for peace&#39;s sake at any moment one of them could ruin it since they hate each other, and I would have to draw my bow at Herculian, Uriel, or even my Uncle Jerald.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They argued in a language I did not comprehend, spitting the words of their masters..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My master bids you his favor, in light of the interference of the Horned One. I bid this world goodbye. I no longer have need to be here.&#34; Said Zumitas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was going to take my brother with Arviel. But thankfully, the resolution was for the Light and Night&#39;s soldiers to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.. And *he* belongs to the Lord of Light?&#34; Asked Aureus, referring to the Herald who left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I the Void&#39;s Herald.&#34; Said Apythmenos. &#34;We were made before the war, and we both are not to interfere.&#34; He said the last part as if he left out some detail</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew the part about them not being able to be near each other That they were opposites through and through. But I guess if the Endless Mountain and the Bottomless Pit tried to fight, it would probably ruin the very peace everyone wanted plus</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Sun means well, but the Void already marked us It&#39;s on our belly buttons from the day we were born, that my grandfather gave us his protection. A blessing by the Light would do a General of Hell no good well intentioned or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I suppose I should leave as well.&#34; Said Apythmenos. &#34;I&#39;m taking Tyson with me though for good measure.&#34; He said snapping his fingers, and they were gone in a puff of pink light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They leave but I stay.&#34; Said Uriel. &#34;This world I&#39;ve been here in spirit a few times, but it&#39;s Changed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can ride with us. It&#39;s the least I can do for you healing my big baby.&#34; Diana smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I feel right as rain.&#34; Said Herculian. &#34;Shame I couldn&#39;t pet you though *friend* .&#34; he grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You let him pet you?!&#34; asked Grace in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you Both can fuck Right off!&#34; I yelled. &#34;Nobody&#39;s petting- Unhand my Hair!&#34; I snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fluff.&#34; Said Herculian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go buy a cat or something!&#34; I slapped his hand away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No he seems more like a wolf person.&#34; Grinned Aureus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him with pursed lips. &#34;You can fuck off too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take Tyson&#39;s rental car back to Wix.&#34; Grinned Rodrick. &#34;Won&#39;t he be upset that none of them were- NO! My Autographed Sun Text Is Wet! OH MY GOD IT&#39;S RUINED!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My clothes ruined his book I panicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can fi-&#34; Uriel was cut off by both of us freaking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those Pants were DRY!!!! THEY WERE DRY!&#34; I frantically ran to help, but the second It Touched My Skin It Burned. &#34;AH! Why did I do that?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got laughed at. Nobody healed me, at least not immediately.</p>
