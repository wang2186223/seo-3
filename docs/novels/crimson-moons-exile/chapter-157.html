                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Poof</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good luck kid.&#34; I heard on the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I. I was in my old car Holy shit. I looked at my hands, and hair and eyes in the mirror</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t summon my claws or fangs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A black scroll with glowing red letters appeared in my hands and a sticker of the Scales it radiated magic</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You&#39;re outside the border of your hometown. Today is everyone&#39;s day off too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Objective: Convince family to be silent, and you may visit as you please.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sticker is to be placed inside a closet, bathroom, or garage upon acceptance. The makeup mirror will allow you to see the entirety of the property, thus insuring any later visit is safe. Should they knock on the wall three times, a bell will ring on the Misfit side, requesting you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Conditions:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&gt;Mortal (Willow) is unable to display supernatural abilities. This is a faith-based trust exercise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&gt;Mortal family members will see *more* the more they believe. Any mortals who already somewhat will initially start out unable to see as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&gt;Mortals must all agree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&gt;Mortals who disagree will be claimed and collected by Gulteer the True Witch King, The Darkened One, The First Witch, and his familiar Zeh&#39;Kahrraam, the First Demon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&gt;Do not interact with any other mortals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&gt;All mortals who see the wife of the 1st General must accept your request within the house, or they will be deleted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deleted?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused *deleted*. So not only will I never see them again they won&#39;t exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&gt;All parties will also be deleted should one speak to someone outside of the house. Any mortal memory not of the 1st General, or his mate&#39;s bloodline will be erased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&gt;Example: Willow visits and a family friend comes over. They will not remember she is dead, and carry on and have a nice time. However, when they leave, they will not remember she was at the house.&lt;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&gt; **NO contact outside the house. No contact with electronic devices**&lt;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&gt;Gulteer has full authority to do with them as he pleases if *he* feels they disrespect you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel so useful today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AH!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; Said I guess the Witch King?! &#34;I&#39;m Gulteer.&#34; He bowed his head, resisting the urge to giggle at me. &#34;I run the master&#39;s magic department. I specialize in all schools of magic, except god&#39;s magic I&#39;m banned.&#34; He grunted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was gray skinned, and had black hair in a tight man bun. He was so pale I thought he was a vampire He had claws, and red eyes the whites of them were black like when Kaizen shows his true appearance but he didn&#39;t relax his. It seemed like light was stolen as he sat there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Willow Kaizen&#39;s mate.&#34; I mumbled. &#34;I assume they won&#39;t be able to see you but my dad&#39;s a decan. Uncle Clarence is a priest, but Father Macky is the one who runs the church. Uncle&#39;s more of an assistant for his assistant.&#34; I said honestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father Macky has 13 tattoo in gothic font on his neck, not the Roman number brand like some of the other priests I&#39;ve met now that I&#39;m a kitsune. The Church of the Sun has many</p>
