                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was still intimidating to be in the car with someone so big so strong so new He was literally a stranger, though for the past 2 hours I heard the news about my &#39;death&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow Samules, Andrew Armors, and his fiancé Amanda Higgles have all been reported dead this morning Tom.&#34; Said one host.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Tom, it&#39;s Tragic. Their truck was found with Andrew driving. Authorities say they&#39;re on the scene, however there were bottles found inside the car. It&#39;s believed that they may have died from alcohol related issues.&#34; He said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it repeated over and over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at my phone and it was there too. Fax News, GNN, The Tomorrow Show. Everyone was talking about the &#39;surge in drunk driving&#39;. I was made out to be a secret alcoholic My Parents were on Tv Crying their eyes out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was Right and texting them now would just be evil</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; He said patting my shoulder. &#34;Had I been there a Little sooner they might be living as well. &#34; He tried consoling me, and I shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a feeling you only say that to make me feel better. And for it I thank you.&#34; I said looking out the window. We were passing a sign advertising McDarrel&#39;s and it was past 10:30am.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could I be hungry?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d just heard that all three of us were marked dead and I want food!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word he got off the closest exit. &#34;You mourn, but you can&#39;t control when you&#39;re hungry&#34; He said as his stomach growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, we can both get burgers.&#34; I said with a sad smile. He didn&#39;t return it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unfortunately, I can&#39;t eat &#39;people&#39; food that greasy.&#34; He said pulling into the drive through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You eat People.&#34; I said more as a joke, but he was silent. The side glance he gave me made his eyes change from orange to red to black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I swore I wouldn&#39;t eat You unless you want me to.&#34; He grinned, taking my hand and kissing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slapped him. He grinned wider. &#34;Ooo- someone smells like Fear. That&#39;s Hot.&#34; He growled, but it sounded like a regular person. &#34;Oh come on that was funny.&#34; He complained. &#34;You&#39;re no fun.&#34; He humphed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome to McDarrel&#39;s.&#34; Said the cashier. I could hear her on WeTube Shorts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um. I want two vanilla shakes extra-large, a Big Derrel. And a large fry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The ice cream machine is broken. Do you want the Big Darrel to be a combo?&#39;  She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;God damnit. Do you drink Koke?&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fine, but diet&#39;s better.&#34; He said with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to convert your order to a combo?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, and can I get a pup cup too?&#34; I asked and he looked at me as if I&#39;d cursed him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have that.&#34; She said with the screen to pull around popping up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. I&#39;m not a Pup.&#34; He grumbled quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then can you add whipped cream as a side?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was silent a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;$15.57 Pull around.&#34; She said as I could hear beeps in the background of her headset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We did as we were told, and she was absolutely swamped. There were more people inside, and many were parked in a vacant lot to the side. Since it was off the interstate, I could only assume that this was a makeshift Truckstop. There were a lot of large 18-wheelers to the left, and to the right was farmland. I had no idea where we were, but wherever it was, it was basically the middle of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman took our money while she was taking orders, and handed us our food. Well my food. She also gave us a look when Kaizen took the pup cup and started licking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; I said cheerfully while Kaizen handed the food to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have a good day.&#34; She said with a genuine smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled off slowly, distracted by the sweet treat in his left hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Not a pup. But thank you for thinking of me.&#34; He said relenting. He Did like it, but I could only assume being a &#39;pup&#39; was an insult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not a pup because you like whipped cream.&#34; I said shaking my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never had fast food on account of human food being hard enough to digest. Most wolves Can, but I am a pureblooded royal. Those in the royal family get indigestion.&#34; He said putting the small paper cup on the top of my head. &#34;And since I&#39;m banished, I figured I&#39;d give you at Least a paper crown.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh stop.&#34; I said making a duck beak with it. It was silly, but he started it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled. &#34;If you want to know, we&#39;re in Kansus. About an hour west past Witchita.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m From here. If we get back on-&#34; he cut me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea. You&#39;ve made national headlines. We&#39;ve Both Seen it. It would give your people Less closure. You can never go back to Your life as much as I can&#39;t either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know but-&#34; I was cut off again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Imagine your dead loved one, one that you&#39;re planning to bury knocks on your door to say &#39;hi&#39;, and can never return only they aren&#39;t a spirit or anything. They&#39;re alive. They&#39;re alive, with a 7&#39;5 foot tall horned man with red eyes. How much closure would they have? They would look for you the rest of their lives, and could be imprisoned if they make too much noise.&#34; He warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever peace they&#39;d get would be gone but what do you mean by that? Are they in danger?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Humans have their own police force. We have our own too. The Secret Police is a unit of humans and supernatural creature alike. They&#39;re Sole Purpose is to maintain the treaty of 1605 and 1607. That humans remain ignorant, and supernaturals keep to their own. That if either side breaks the law, then that individual belongs to the other.&#34; He said getting back on the interstate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I didn&#39;t Do anything All we did was camp out there.&#34; I said a little defensively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed. &#34;By crossing our border and knowing who we were, you all forfeited your freedom Willow. The addendum made years ago might have saved you if we had mind wiping potions or magic but they didn&#39;t follow the law. They just started killing because their leaders were away.&#34; He sounded frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then maybe you could appeal all that; you&#39;re probably still a prince until trial&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was a lazy Beta, and an even Worse Alpha substitute if they couldn&#39;t at Least follow orders a few days. My brother may be standing King but he has already ruled that I am to be captured and returned to the kingdom alive. He means to punish me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked out the window, as it was silent a moment. &#34;Then I have nowhere to go, and you vowed to keep me safe for now let&#39;s just drive and see where this takes us.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can do that.&#34; He said with a nod. &#34;And now that you&#39;ve eaten, I&#39;ll make sure you get your leg mended. It doesn&#39;t hurt, does it?&#34; He asked out of concern, and I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s kind of numb, but the pain is there.&#34; I admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll make sure I get you something at the Meat Market, but when I take you, you Cannot leave my side.&#34; He warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I don&#39;t think I want to go to a place where it&#39;s pretty obvious people are on the menu.&#34; I said quietly, and he chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Humans are on nearly every menu. It is why the treaty keeps us secret.&#34; He scoffed. &#34;I mean no ill towards your people, but every state has at least two. Humans in reality are food Willow. Supernaturals manage this world. Most of you live in blissful ignorance, especially since most meat now is farm raised.&#34; He said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We aren&#39;t beef cows!&#34; I yelled a little angrier than I meant to, and he glanced at me briefly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is a hard pill to swallow, but I gain Nothing by lying to you. Every supernatural, every Single One should be treated as a man eater. Unless they&#39;re a unicorn or herbivore, they aren&#39;t exactly vegan. I kind of wish I was lying, I really do.&#34; He said nothing else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat like this for about an hour. The radio blared, and I sat there looking out the window. I came from a small town in the heart of the country I was blessed enough to work in Vermount. Yet there was an entire world I didn&#39;t know. How many of them had I encountered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s all out there?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re ready.&#34; He said tapping a claw on the steering wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it That bad?&#34; I asked timidly. He was Massive so much so that I knew he had to shrink to fit in this car so my imagination wasn&#39;t playing tricks on me I don&#39;t think I&#39;d seen his true height</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did last night and Yeah. Because All of it, even some of the slasher films are out there. Chuck the Doll is inspired from a Real spell. Vampires, witches, dragons, trolls, unicorns, elves, werewolves, werebears, various animal-kin, goblins, hybrid magical, mindless beasts, and half beasts who Do have a mind, like minotaur.&#34; He said without skipping a beat. &#34;I am a werewolf technically. Both my parents are purebloods, but my father&#39;s father is the Horned One. My mother&#39;s grandfather is the King of Wolves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was quiet a Long time there was a short period where I didn&#39;t even hold thoughts. But I accepted it better than I thought I would. Instead of freak out, in my fear of him, I asked more questions</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I assume your brother is in training for his position. I remember something about him being a standing king Is the original king sick or something?&#34; I asked. His gentle hand on my shoulder calmed me That was the mate bond; it gave me comfort, like I knew of all the stuff out there, he would shield me from it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, he just wants to retire a bit. Tyson with our blessings and size equal his, so King Ashital has stepped down Last night was my brother&#39;s inauguration party.and I pull This. But I&#39;d do it again.&#34; He growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Why?&#34; I asked He saved me, trading all he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you are the gift the goddess gave me.&#34; He said honestly. He seemed conflicted, but pointed to the exit. &#34;There&#39;s the meat market.&#34; He said getting into the right lane.</p>
