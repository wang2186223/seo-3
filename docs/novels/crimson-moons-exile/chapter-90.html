                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Crap, it&#39;s already 10!&#34; I shouted, looking at my phone. I took a quick shower and threw on a long, blue dress since it would fit over my bump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went downstairs for a cup of juice and something to eat tooKaizen was gone, but this time he left a text.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were cleaning out the dungeon that held Contradiction. They also prepped the grounds to be blessed and ready to make a small living area for the humans. I was fine with that. Communication was what I wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eternya had the fire witch sleeping in his lap, the one he used to watch the fight with Contradiction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shouldn&#39;t you. Like not be doing that?&#34; I asked looking at him suspiciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She showed me the happenings of this world until she passed out. Elinore is a good girl.&#34; He petted her hair</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father, as I said, why don&#39;t you marry her?&#34; Said Flora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was making stir fried beef with leftovers  She fixed breakfast for her sons, and now me. They ate on the couch, while I was served at the dining table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone would be against that. I don&#39;t want more children, and I cannot do that to a mortal. It isn&#39;t fair. She&#39;s only 76 for fuck&#39;s sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you ask?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. All I&#39;ll do is break her heart, or worse, throw another bastard on her. I wonder what that daughter will do. All of them end up as rebels.&#34; He said it as a joke, but I could tell he was clearly pissed off at himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Did you ever stop to think that this time, you&#39;ll be there for your child?&#34; Said Flora. &#34;You didn&#39;t know about me, but I know you might have asked to raise me at least.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would have.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;The master probably would have ordered you beheaded, or given away as a concubine to punish meI would have no choice but to oblige. And now, my reputation is tarnished..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure Xaxas nor Kaizen would stop you from getting married. That&#39;s different It isn&#39;t a fling if that&#39;s your wife, and your children won&#39;t be bastards.&#34; Said Flora. &#34;I have my husband, yet you did not kill him like I thought you would&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t kill my daughter&#39;s lover because he is a half beast. I reserve that for if he was anything like me.&#34; He smiled as he said that, but I knew he was serious. &#34;Times are different Maybe he might allow us to settle down.&#34; He said holding her close. &#34;At any moment, I could be ordered to fly into battle, and leave her behind. At any moment, on a whim of my master, he may order me to snap her neck as he did with Eskaal But his betrothed was a potential traitorHe didn&#39;t wait to investigate her either. But I know Elinore would pose no threat to the mistress&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have his number; I&#39;ll just call.&#34; I said getting my phone out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas appeared in person, sitting in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; I yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t even press call yet!&#34; I complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too bad. If you don&#39;t want me summoned, don&#39;t summon me. What&#39;s up kiddo?&#34; He asked, ruffling my hair. &#34;Having aches and pains yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I actually wanted to ask about Eternya.&#34; I said sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he not falling in line?&#34; He asked with a glare. &#34;I&#39;ve seen your flirting with the mortal there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I was asking if he&#39;d have permission to marry that witch.&#34; I said seeing Eternya turn white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Said Xaxas firmly. &#34;He does not need distractions at such a critical time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He can do his job And have a wife. If anything, it&#39;ll give him a greater investment to stay.&#34; I said just as firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned back in the dining chair, and glared at me. &#34;I do not repeat myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then don&#39;t.&#34; I countered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I attracted a lot of attention. I could smell fear from any who heard me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This Isn&#39;t a fling, right?&#34; He demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No master. I haven&#39;t known her long, but she would make a good wife. If you wish I mate another firebird, I will.&#34; Eternya said this standing, but before he could bow, Xaxas interfered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snapped his fingers, and Elinore was in front of him, awake. She was disoriented a moment  She kneeled immediately on seeing Xaxas, looking confused about the location change. in front of a disgruntled King the Realm King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Master. She is a good person.&#34; Said Eternya. &#34;I formally vouch for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elinore, what do you feel for Eternya, the son of your master mortal?&#34; Said Xaxas firmly. His gaze could cut steel, and I felt bad for her. Xaxas was served wine and ate roasted, stir fried beef at the table, waiting for her to speak. I could only assume that as she stood there mortified, she was gathering her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At first, I only saw him as my master&#39;s sonSome hot, yet unapproachable, unobtainable man I should kneel to, no pun intended I did as he asked but now when he looks at me, his gaze is soft It makes me feel fuzzy. I&#39;ve not had a real relationship, as I was promised to Lord Ignis of Fire Obsidian coven.&#34; Elinore said looking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that why you ran away?&#34; Asked Xaxas. I know he knew, but he wanted her to say it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes master, because the task he gave instead was cruel. When I was rejected back informally, in anger, he wanted me to keep watch of the cursed objects we store, The Volcano&#39;s Rage Amulet. That one in particular steals your youth, and ages you like a human the more you&#39;re around them but we do not die Those who keep them become strong for a short time, then old and ugly like hags The last keeper was found dead, looking so decrepit her mother didn&#39;t recognize her&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that why as a fire mage, you hold burn marks on your back, chest, and legs?&#34; Asked Xaxas. She wore clothes over marks like that, but I could only guess he could sense that or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did not know this I never thought- Where is he?&#34; Demanded Eternya, but the hand of Xaxas made him silent. She looked self-conscious to admit it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The hex burns are from my rejection, but should he have accepted it with grace, this would not have been. He did this to mar me&#34; She said looking down. &#34;He holds the same mark on his face and hands.&#34; She hissed. &#34;It&#39;s what he gets for being a petty, spoiled child. He won&#39;t even formally break the engagement on his end out of spite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deals are deals, but I say he broke it when he shed your blood. Husbands ought not lay hands on their betrothed, rejected or not. I&#39;m sure your father renounced the engagement on seeing this, and if he doesn&#39;t he will.&#34; Said Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is not marred to me to me she is Elinore, the young, small woman who likes Tv dramas as much as I do.&#34; He said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then go with your bride. I was against it at first because the concept of you changing was so absurd, that I dismissed it entirely.&#34; Said Xaxas. &#34;By my authority, you are now married should you both accept.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I accept.&#34; Said Elinore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do as well.&#34; Said Eternya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then it&#39;s settled. I&#39;m very curious to see how this will turn out.&#34; He said sipping the wine casually. &#34;This is a nice port.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;May I take the life of Lord Ignis?&#34; Asked Eternya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t rightly care.&#34; Said Xaxas casually. &#34;Ignis has not pursued you mortal, thus this also deems it in my mind that he does not want you. He has not claimed you in any way other than harming you. I think it fair he reaps the wrath of your husband. I&#39;ll text Zytherian to tell him this.&#34; Said the Lord of Judgment. &#34;I&#39;m not picking favorites either. What man would I be to force a victim to be with their abuser?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said that looking at Elinore, who I could only assume was afraid he&#39;d say that. To be fair I was too a little</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come Willow. I came to kidnap you.&#34; Xaxas said standing up and stretching. &#34;No, it isn&#39;t negotiable. Yes, I texted Kaizen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the blink of an eye, I was surrounded by happy bubbly werewolves. What pack, or where I was, I had no idea, but it seemed all his family was here. I had to fight the nausea of teleportation</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finally, everyone&#39;s here!&#34; Yelled Isabelle. &#34;Welcome to BeastMoon! Surprise!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hugged me tight, and I felt how loved I was. It was nice to see her, along with Harmony,, Nixxia, and Samira.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I&#39;ll be outside with the other men.&#34; Said Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you going to name them?! I heard you&#39;re having twins.&#34; Said Samira.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, but I was thinking about something in wolf?&#34; I said more as a question. I wanted to give them strong names that they could be proud of. Or an old one. Many of the people I&#39;ve met had older names because they were from a different time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OH! Like what?!&#34; Shouted Isabelle. &#34;I can&#39;t wait to be a flippin&#39; grandma And play with Puppies Again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And a uni-puppy.&#34; Giggled Samira as a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And a dragon-pup.&#34; Said Grace. She came in the living room while Aureus had gifts for me and Samira. &#34;The key to all of them getting along will be forging a strong littermate bond.&#34; She said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They can have playdates and we could visit on the weekends.&#34; I said thinking out loud. I was looking forward to having my children now that their fates were changed. I had no doubt in my mind that if Kaizen didn&#39;t make that wish, that we would have issues later on.</p>
