                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silent pause was almost awkward. The only thing that could be heard were the machines hooked up to my human formed mate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel her plight, but no.&#34; Said Xaxas firmly. &#34;Why does everyone question my rulings? Just because it doesn&#39;t satisfy you, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll play favorites nephew.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even I disagree.&#34; Said Herculian, holding Vexterios. He had my pup on his chest, and my son squeaked contently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow was knocked out, but I know she was also listening as best as she could. Mother still didn&#39;t trust Herculian, since he held the sun on his back shoulder It would take some time to trust anyone like that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow and the pups though were my priority They&#39;d eaten, and were resting now, but I felt for her too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart hurt for her mother, and I could understand it She could never show her mother our children, nor her life. She will outlive them too. Her people still mourned her &#39;death&#39; and as I held her, I questioned what I could do to fix this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if I got the humans and brought them here, they&#39;d just be in danger at all times. They would have to live in the cells like the other humans, because if the vampires don&#39;t drink them dry, the ghoul will rip them apart</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow&#39;s former mortality should be taken into consideration at least uncle. Does she really have to go through this?&#34; I asked Xaxas. He was here of his own accord, but as the Realm King, if I could convince him, maybe at least she could see her, but not interact</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She made her choice.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;It may not seem fair to you right now, but better they die thinking they lost her, than a reappearance with no reconciliation. You ask too much.&#34; He said this with crossed arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harmony held Aristaeus. &#34;She&#39;s strong Kaizen. Letting Willow visit them, even for a moment, wouldn&#39;t be fair to them. They can&#39;t live here; I see the preserve the elves made for the humans. It&#39;s nice, yeah ,but you&#39;d take them from their home, to put them in a zoo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know It doesn&#39;t hurt to try though.&#34; I said petting her hair. She was done crying, and I felt like I failed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t Fail her.&#34; Said Xaxas. &#34;I kept the Treaty in place so her parents can live in peace. Their home is quiet without their daughter.&#34; He said looking south. &#34;I&#39;ll give them another child. That would be fair compensation for taking this one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So she&#39;ll have a sister or brother that she&#39;ll never meet?&#34; I asked, but his glare told me that he&#39;d had enough. He did not like being questioned, nor did he appreciate that I brought up something he obviously didn&#39;t think of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is Fair. Willow is a Kitsune, one with Pups that hold no human shape yet.&#34; He said annoyed. &#34;To allow contact would only open wounds they still heal from. To let them ask questions they aren&#39;t meant to ponder will gain them imprisonment at Best, and Death at its worst.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What of a dream?&#34; Asked my father. &#34;I could do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure you want to use your magic?&#34; Asked Xaxas with surprise. &#34;Will you accept the consequences should this be a bad idea as I said?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do. I agree with Kaizen. I&#39;ll take responsibility should it go sour.&#34; He said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;ll honor it. Take my scales.&#34; He waved his hand, and a set of scales appeared in dad&#39;s hand. &#34;If the sun side weighs down, end the dream. It means that they&#39;re going to wake up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scales had a small magic sun the size of a marble in one of the bronze bowls, while the other had a black orb in the other. The black one had the Horned One&#39;s mark in red, while there was a black circle, the Sign of the Sun, in the other</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t give her much time, but something is better than nothing.&#34; Said father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>----Willow----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you heard everything.&#34; Said Bryson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He placed a set of scales on the ground, and they grew to be 20 feet tall. One side held a sun floating in it, while the other a black orb that stole the light around it Once done, he shifted, and my parents stood in front of me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was in a field filled with black, purplish dandelions The endless sea of them smelled like roses, a sweet, delicate scent that was pleasing to the nose. There wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky,, and the temperature was perfect. Better than the cold, sterile place of the clinic, where I noticed the beeps of nearly every machine in the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34; asked mom. She picked a dandelion that&#39;d went to seed, and blew a wish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi mom.&#34; I waved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She immediately cried. &#34;Oh my baby, look at you!&#34; She said as she ran to hug me. It felt nice Father stood there, dumbfounded, looking at Bryson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just behind me, being the largest wolf I think I&#39;d ever seen. He looked like a taller, fuller horned version of my husband, except between his horns was a floating crown, identical to the horned One&#39;s. He said nothing though, because I don&#39;t know if he could speak or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m alright mom. I just wanted to tell you to let me go.&#34; I said almost not wanting to leave this moment</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were so young.&#34; Said dad. &#34;There isn&#39;t a day I don&#39;t walk past your old room, and think of you, you know.&#34; He smiled sadly, and I got to hug him too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still smelled the same. My instincts added to it, that he was &#39;dad&#39; in my mind, but he also smelled like the cologne he always wore</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was better that they didn&#39;t know details  All they needed to know was that it was ok to move on from losing me That I wasn&#39;t lost but for their sake, it was best they thought that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been having such a nice time, I caught myself forgetting about my life.&#34; I admitted. I thought they&#39;d be mad at me, but instead he looked relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m ok with that.&#34; Said dad. &#34;Just don&#39;t forget that we love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me want to tell them everything, but Bryson looked at the scales. The sun dipped lower, it was no longer balanced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s time to go.&#34; Said Bryson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodbye.&#34; I said hugging them until I woke up in Kaizen&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So how was it?&#39; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They got closure.&#34; I said about as content about it as I could be I wanted more time, but if that was all I could get, I&#39;d take that a thousand times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had a right to know I was ok.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I let them remember it.&#34; Said Bryson. &#34;She didn&#39;t share anything compromising, so when they wake, they can be confident that it&#39;s ok to move on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still disagree with this.&#34; Said Xaxas, getting his scales back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to.&#34; Said Bryson with crossed arms. &#34;I will not sit here and allow my pup&#39;s eyes filled with tears, when there&#39;s a solution in front of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what&#39;s done is done. I&#39;ll go speak with Arviel myself to get the ball rolling on a replacement child for them. It isn&#39;t the same thing as having Willow, but it&#39;s better than nothing.&#34; Said Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m ready to head home.&#34; Said Harmony, she handed my pup Aristaeus to Bryson. He looked so proud of them</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; I said getting a smile out of the stern granpa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. I think I&#39;ll go check on Samira now. Are you ready Isabelle?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am.&#34; She kissed each of the pups, and hugged us. &#34;I&#39;m still sorry that you have to deal with all this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be alright.&#34; I said looking at my pups. If ever one day they wanted to know more about that side of their family, I would tell them. They wouldn&#39;t be able to visit, but they should know their family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They vanished with a small puff of red smoke, and it left us with Herculian. &#34;I should go too. It&#39;s getting late.&#34; He said petting my sons one last time. &#34;I&#39;ll probably be back tomorrow.&#34; Vexterios was given to Kaizen. He yawned being so tiny, and sleepy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow, I get to go home.&#34; I said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;ll bring a housewarming gift.&#34; He left, becoming a beam of light when he closed the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wished that dream was longer, I really do but they got what they needed. I did too I got to say goodbye to everyone now. I held my pups. They smelled like the flowers in my dreams. My parents would probably freak out about my babies, but they&#39;d have loved them too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen looked happy with my words, but I felt his concern. He probably thought I wanted to go back to my family to leave this life and this world. I don&#39;t think I could ever do that, with or without pups. I have a mate, and I chose him over all the gifts and trinkets the Horned One could offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finally, I have you *almost* all to myself.&#34; He said kissing me on the forehead. &#34;I ordered pizza too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already ate, but there&#39;s always room for pizza.&#34; I said sitting up. I put the boys on the bed so they could relax. I sat in Kaizen&#39;s lap and we watched Tv once the delivery got here. There was now a small pizza shop, and a Hamberger Royalty outside of town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hoped no one would question why a pizza place, or fast-food restaurant was in the middle of the woods off a thin two-way road, but I wasn&#39;t complaining. I got to have junk food. There was its own little comfort in it. As a supernatural now, this kind of stuff was more of an occasional treat than something I could have often.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We watched The Termination Man with Ronald Schwarzenegger, a old, cheesy classic. We&#39;d both seen it before, but it passed time. For a little while, we had actual peace. No one linked us with anything, no one needed us, since Ace covered for Kaizen. Flora watched Ellio and the other minotaur. She took it upon herself to show them all she knew, while Eternya flew around doing a quick border patrol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to be fair, I think he was using that as an excuse to hang out with Elinore. Either way, I let my head rest on Kaizen&#39;s shoulder. I would cherish this peace, because once the boys woke up, it would be time to feed them again.</p>
