                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I Excused myself and ran to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was given a pregnancy test by Isabelle, the only one who followed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cried in there, but she didn&#39;t come in. She sat in my room on the bed, but another was slid under the door</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone rang, but I ignored it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen could block his emotions and pain but I couldn&#39;t... He knew something was wrong. It wasn&#39;t a bad thing, but I wasn&#39;t ready for all this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They way they spoke sounded like he was talking about using my child for War before they were even born.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want my child to have to fight like that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I did, even knowing that my mate was fine, was hold to the edge of my seat like it was going to run away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone seemed to answer itself Interference from one of his family, likely Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; Asked Kaizen with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am just a little scared and worried.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awe everything&#39;s alright baby, and if it&#39;s not, I&#39;ll make it so.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;We&#39;re only an hour or two away. We&#39;d already be there, but Herculian wanted to go to his brother&#39;s graves this morning. He&#39;s done though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen I&#39;m pregnant.&#34; I said silently. He said nothing on the other side. &#34;Kaizen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be there in 30.&#34; He said hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t think he wanted that kind of responsibility yet He didn&#39;t sound exactly happy about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow, do I need to come in there?&#34; Asked Isabelle like a mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I said being a baby about it. Samira could be heard having a fit herselfThough Tyson was still dead It was 8pm now she still had a few hours to go before he found out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She came in anyway and she made me sit down. My head was put in her lap and she pet my hair. &#34;I bet you&#39;re thinking &#39;he&#39;s mad at me&#39; or something. I know my son. He&#39;d never be upset that his mate was with pup. He might be worried though, since I went through quite a bit but you won&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. I never heard about any of that. He doesn&#39;t talk about his childhood much&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was born a pup you know that part. They were kids in a wolf&#39;s body They got into trouble, as all children do, but not too much.&#34; She smiled. &#34;The only issue was the High Council, and their constant attempt to deem them a danger to kill them because they feared my mate would rise up, and be like his brothers. Bryson isn&#39;t even 500 He never participated in the war. Some of them are so old, that their ages are estimatesyet they feared a man they called &#39;pup&#39;. &#39;boy&#39;. Now he has demigod children, and our children will make lesser demigods.&#34; She mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How does that work.&#34; I sat up, wiping my eyes, ashamed of the tantrum everyone heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Bryson is a full god Kaizen is half. The issue is that the Horned One made them more or less like minor gods. He doesn&#39;t like making hybrids He isn&#39;t into the business of it, but the trade off is that your child might be like his father, but with one major weakness&#34; She said thinking out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like Akhilleas.Didn&#39;t he die because of his foot or something?&#34; I always wondered that, but I still cried I didn&#39;t want them to be defeated because someone stubbed their toe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes but I doubt Zuviel would even do that I&#39;ve spoken with the Horned One a few times But I do know one thing: With Diana pregnant by his son, Arviel is going to cheat the rules as much as he can, and so will the Horned One in retaliation&#34; She said looking like she didn&#39;t want to share something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want that for my child.&#34; I said a little angrily. I cried like a baby I hated that I wasn&#39;t handling this like a strong, confident bad ass who-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pet me between the horns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holy Shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know what she did, but it was like the stress part of my brain turned off</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want that for my grandchildren either But it will be alright. Xaxas already said there would be no more war I&#39;m sure he intends to make good on that.&#34; She said soothingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What what is this?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I heard about it, I forgot It felt too nice to even carry a conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A secret.&#34; She grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a crackle and explosion outside, then stomping up the stairs. People screamed, cheered, and clapped, but  my mate was too determined to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here.&#34; Said Kaizen out of breath, knocking the bedroom door off its hinges. He ignored it, and rand to me. He held the sides of my face with clawed hands, and kissed me on the lips. &#34;Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed his horns to my forehead, and took me from his mother. I was limp I had no bones. I was mush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see you got this.&#34; She said shaking her head. She left us to be alone, likely to help with Samira</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone keeps talking about war. I just want to be left alone.&#34; I hugged his neck. When she stopped, I felt myself come back online like that was a spell. I HAD to try that with Kaizen but not right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only left because that bastard hurt you I&#39;m not a king, Willow We don&#39;t have to go anywhere or do anything. Even if our child is an Omega, it would not matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; I said letting him hold me He kissed me on the top of my head, and my horns disappeared on their own His touch on them felt nice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mom didn&#39;t make it worse but she didn&#39;t make it better like he did either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what the Hell was that &#39;secret&#39;?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;ll be ok Willow.&#34; He said interrupting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I really. Really didn&#39;t want our children to go out there and die for someone else&#39;s squabble...  Even if the Horned One and Lord of Light were just regular kings we&#39;d still be servants in a kingdom, as my mate would be a knight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This Counts! Fuck it.&#34; Yelled Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Yelled Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was confused too until there was another boom, but this time I think he summoned the other Kings</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AH!&#34; Screamed Jerold downstairs. &#34;I WAS DRIVING!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your SHIT Toyota is fine!&#34; Yelled Xaxas. &#34;You&#39;re *Welcome*.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;JER-BEAR!&#34; Yelled Noah there were awes until I could also hear shuffling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t get into any more trouble, did you?&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unhand me.&#34; Hissed Noah playfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I missed you too.&#34; He gruffly admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow&#34; Said the voice of the Unicorn King. In person it sounded literally angelic. &#34;I scent one of my bloodline here.&#34;</p>

                <p>&#34;.  Also?&#34; parroted Herculian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also.&#34; Said Diana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living room was silent. The joyous ruckus was now turned to one of curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34; Said Kaizen carrying me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. I held onto him, and he made his way down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you find out?&#34; Said Herculian</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This moment.&#34; Said Diana &#34;My mistress&#39;s powers are renewed and so are mine. I bet you didn&#39;t realize I was weakened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t If I did, I wouldn&#39;t have let you come.&#34; He said stiffly. Herculian shook wrists with Kaizen. &#34;Maybe this will kick the pantheon in the ass to do better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope it does meathead.&#34; Kaizen grinned.  &#34;Want to address the pack? I mean we have a proper packhouse now Thanks Uncle Xaxas!&#34; He shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least someone appreciates me.&#34; His uncle said this as if he were hurt, showing that silly side I heard so much about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took my hand and kissed me one more time He was . Really stinky for a moment. But it couldn&#39;t be helped. I heard it was supposed to be like a demon&#39;s musk or something. That all three smelled like that in battle</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone made way for us, while his family decided to let him be. This was Misfit. He was Alpha I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever seen a dad so proud, yet silent of their child. Mr. Bryson stood with his brothers, and Kaizen looked around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a rare moment I felt him... nervous. I didn&#39;t feel him at all during that fight. Yet addressing his people made him shy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must say, I did not ever expect to say this so soon, but as you all heard, I&#39;m going to be a dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were cheers, but they let him do his speech. They quieted with the raise of his hand</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My status and title were from my bloodline, but my merit is my own. I, along with the Kings, have slain a foe. There is Peace and for it to remain so, I will keep watch.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;However, I say this now: I won&#39;t involve myself unless I HAVE To. Misfit is no kingdom, but it is a place for all unwanted, the mindless, and the vagabond. By my power, I will pardon, and by my authority, you will be safe.&#34; He smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha what about those who fail you?&#34; Asked Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen looked at him firmly, likely reading his mind. &#34;You tried fighting Eternya? You dumb ass.&#34; He facepalmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was a threat!&#34; Jack complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s marked by my uncle, you little liar.&#34; Kaizen said rolling his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here to stay too.&#34; Said Eternya with a huff. &#34;I&#39;m crashing at my kid&#39;s place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you&#39;re not, you bum!&#34; She yelled flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eternya looked a little deflated, but I wouldn&#39;t mind him staying at the end of the new Alpha floor I wouldn&#39;t mind the extra protection, or help should my mate need it.</p>
