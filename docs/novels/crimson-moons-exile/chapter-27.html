                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was actually running an errand. Would you mind coming along?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me as if I had some kind of trick up my sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you Must.&#34; Tamriel said with an annoyed huff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know the way to the clothing store, but he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So tell me, how long have you known the Horned Wolf?&#34; He asked firmly. There was no negotiation he expected an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A few weeks. We got married before we moved in.&#34; I said truthfully it hadn&#39;t been that long any other &#39;normal&#39; person would have shaken me and asked me was I crazy for eloping with essentially my fated captor And here I was about to buy said captor clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clothing store was right in front of us. We&#39;d gotten here so fast since we were housed kind of close to one of the shopping districts. This place was all about convenience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. &#34;Have you met my son yet?&#34; He asked, opening the door for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you and no.&#34; I said seeing all the stuff in here. It was kind of like a general store, minus the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They bowed to us, but honestly, I assumed the elves who ran this shop did that because of Mr. Tamriel. He wore a blade at his hip and had on a security uniform</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just grabbed 4 of the largest shirts and sweats they had, random colors, and some tshirts and leggings for myself I spent about $200 for Just simple clothes. They weren&#39;t even named brand. I should have just used Arrowzon!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me get those.&#34; Said Tamriel, holding my things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; I said a little sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come with me to the station. I feel like we could talk more privately there.&#34; He said thinking out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mind. It isn&#39;t far is it?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No mortal.&#34; He said opening the door for me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked in silence, but I had questions too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; so, what brought you here?&#34; I asked politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t even fucking know.&#34; He grumbled, like he didn&#39;t want to be here. &#34;I guess to start, my wife was human. I begged for her to bring her before the master, and he refused. He said if I&#39;d waited, and let her die naturally, I could have had her but she was turned to a vampire.&#34; He sighed angrily. &#34;It&#39;s my fault. During the War, everyone was out to get everyone else having a human wife was a weakness that got exploited Just like master warned me about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That sounds terrible.&#34; I mumbled but I was already marked for there so was Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I originally came to see my wife, but no, I&#39;m here for Business.&#34; He complained. &#34;The only good thing that came of this, is that she can&#39;t get pregnant anymore.&#34; Tamriel said this as a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d made it to the security station. It was a plain square brick building. It kind of stuck out compared to the fancy houses and enormous mansions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They bowed to him when he walked through the door and I was instructed to sit in a chair. This looked like an interrogation room, but I was given coffee and cookies. The room looked like an interrogation room. There was a large 2 way mirror in there, along with a simple 2 chair and table set up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. I wanted to talk to you about the threat of your mate.&#34; He said sitting across from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen said he would be Alpha of this place. He isn&#39;t going to mess it up or anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that, however as a fugitive so wanted, I worry he will bring war to my territory Now he&#39;s also brought captives from a rival or whatever via that *Troublemaker* Jack the Slasher.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;My wife and son live here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mate wouldn&#39;t do that it would be King Tyson as the aggressor. It&#39;s all I&#39;ve heard about.&#34; I said eating a cookie that was offered oatmeal raisin with a hot cocoa latte like  I was confused about if I was in trouble somehow or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s why I have you. If this was the old times little one, I&#39;d have you on a pike high in the air for him to see. I wouldn&#39;t have Allowed a threat to be so close.&#34; He said deathly serious. &#34;But with modern times, come modern solutions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t afraid. But I Should be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by that.&#34; I demanded shyly. I&#39;d trusted him so easily because of the passive peace he made me feel. I was an Idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you&#39;re human.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;I&#39;m not going to hurt you, but I Do need to test something.&#34; He said stomping his feet, and he became encased in silver armor that shined so brightly, it hurt my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Are you trying to make Kaizen the way he was?&#39; I asked referring to the night he saved me. &#34;To a mindless state? That&#39;s Terrible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do His Work. Too many of my master&#39;s followers live here to let a threat attract more threats, and to have him walk freely if he is only a mindless Dog.&#34; He said angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lies!&#34; I yelled. &#34;No Lord of Light would order you to provoke him like that on purpose!&#34; I yelled standing up but I couldn&#39;t rouse my own anger. I said it like I was anyway though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed. &#34;Oh mortals. What the master Didn&#39;t do to his enemies for Your sakes.. and you throw it away.&#34; He sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t throw anything away!&#34; I shouted. &#34;I chose to be happy, and have true love. The connection of soulmates is unlike anything I&#39;ve ever experienced. It&#39;s something you can&#39;t even put a value on&#34; I said this honestly, because I couldn&#39;t. I couldn&#39;t see my world without him in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I wouldn&#39;t have him bad mouth Kaizen. He literally did everything he could to make me happy. And so far, everyone was safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re Blinded. You forget he is a general  of Hell walking this earth in flesh. You don&#39;t realize the True destructive powers of a man too young to control his powers You think a few dozen of his own kin is bad? Try Billions, like his uncle and his One-Sided &#39;War&#39;.&#34; He growled, though it wasn&#39;t like an animal or anything. &#34;Try looking at the devastation of entire cities without vomiting from the rot. To ferry countless multifils until your wings are too tired to flap. To see the rest to see Good people people meant for Haven sent to HELL through no fault of their own!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was quiet I had the luxury to read about a few fables and storiesa lot of this stuff I either knew partially if at all.. &#34;But Kaizen isn&#39;t his uncle. He wouldn&#39;t do that! He literally is beating himself up everyday for what he&#39;s done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Completion of that goal and the Intention of it are two different things. So long as he cannot control himself, I Refuse to allow him to endanger all the souls here.&#34; He said with crossed arms. &#34;I will not make another mistake of trusting a Child of Darkness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounded like he was referring to his wife &#34;Kaizen isn&#39;t a vampire and I know how heartless they are&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You only know but a page. There&#39;s Volumes of Evil those people do. And I sent one of mine to research who Jack brought alive.&#34; He growled. &#34;You&#39;re here because I want you safe when I speak with him. A fight would likely level the town, so I want no part in that. I won&#39;t let you be killed either.&#34; He said getting up and leaving out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to think fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you swear on your blood that you won&#39;t fight Kaizen?&#34; I asked firmly. &#34;I don&#39;t know a lot about supernatural peoples. But I Do know of all things, oath breaking means something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s more than Something a man is only as good as his word.. and oath breaking sends you to hell. So I will vow on my blood. So long as he doesn&#39;t swing at me first, I won&#39;t draw my blade.&#34; He said leaving. &#34;But I&#39;m serious, don&#39;t leave here. He won&#39;t be in his right mind, and may accidently hurt you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He locked me inside the interrogation room with soda, sandwiches, and more snacks but I didn&#39;t want any of it I was too nervous for my mate&#39;s sake at the moment. Time went slowly. He said he was protecting me, but it was his fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen can become lightning and use fire, but he never did it around me unless he was sure I&#39;d be fine But with me in here, the only thing Tamriel is going to do is provoke Kaizen. I hope he has the self control not to start killing. As it is I don&#39;t think I want to live here anymore, but I won&#39;t say anything for the other&#39;s sakes. Their lives are important too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of them have anywhere to go, and this is likely the safest place they Could be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just hang tight Luna.&#34; Said someone on the intercom. &#34;Lord Tamriel is a dick, but he&#39;s ran this place since before most of us were born He blames himself for all the humans being turned.
