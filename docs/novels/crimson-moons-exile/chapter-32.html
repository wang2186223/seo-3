                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow?&#34; I asked a little amused. She was out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slept under the covers holding onto my chest. I was content, but a little worried I got carried away. But I should have known that was going to happen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless, it was now midnight, and I was awake from my nap. I needed to check on some things with Jack and Gilbert. Those two were the least stable and my responsibility. And I&#39;d left them to their own devices for a few hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs the wolves that were up were watching TV. Anyone who wanted to get paid to be security unfortunately couldn&#39;t be paid on payroll by me This wasn&#39;t a &#39;real&#39; pack after all. There were some things I&#39;d never be able to provide, like putting them in the MoonPack Registration System, print them new ID&#39;s so they aren&#39;t Rogues anymore, or have a true pack status, meaning if they wanted to move, they could without having to talk to their previous Alpha. Theres no guarantee that they left their original packs on good terms, or if it even existed anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was more of a psychological annoyance than a real one though. The wolves who came with me were glad they didn&#39;t have to look over their shoulders, while the ones who were already here were glad they had an Alpha again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going out?&#34; Asked Jack. Of the two I&#39;d given my blood to drink, he was always the most eager to go hunting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We already sent a message to the Rogues out there. It&#39;ll be quiet at least for tonight.&#34; I said shaking my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both bowed their heads, and I nodded to release them. I was up mostly to figure out how me and Tyson were going to meet. I knew I would have no peace now that I&#39;d helped him, since he saw what I&#39;d done as an act of war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t spoken to me of course, but I knew him well enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Ace asleep yet?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s outside.&#34; Said Gilbert. He was only bloodthirsty toward humans and wild game, but with my blood binding him to me, he could be controlled as well I hope there doesn&#39;t come a time when I have to pull that card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got bows as I walked, but I could also scent the fear in their hearts. I could hear the thoughts of my horns and how many of them were still apprehensive about me, since I was a &#39;demon&#39;. I actually wasn&#39;t, but I never corrected people who thought I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Technically I was a general of Hell already, I just wasn&#39;t dead yet. If working for, or being owned by the Void King makes you a demon, I guess I&#39;m guilty as charged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ace was outside, drinking a human beer brand while on the job. If it were elvish, I&#39;d scold him, but no werewolf I knew could get drunk from the low alcohol content. Maybe Omegas?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Alpha.&#34; He said sadly. He smelled like he had a small buzz going. He had a small cooler of sodas next to him too. I got a Kokie-Cola.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem pretty down.&#34; I said taking a sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know all this is going to go to shit because of My family sir.&#34; He said looking at the dirt. &#34;For generations, my people have been a problem I don&#39;t want to die, but maybe you should just-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your family&#39;s actions Aren&#39;t yours. You literally left, changed your alias, and worked Hard to be different from them.&#34; I said shaking my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, I literally hear them linking me Right Now even though I know they&#39;re dead&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now That was concerning.I saw, nor sensed any spirits, except his. He was all over the place. &#34;Mind telling me?&#34; I asked, putting a hand on his shoulder. I&#39;d never done it before, but I tried siphoning some of the sorrow out of him. He paused in the silence, and calmly took a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They want me to go to OilMoon since I&#39;m its heir, and figure out a way to get into the good graces of the king by taking the 14th seat now that it&#39;s empty to kill him. That sounds crazy, doesn&#39;t it?&#34; He asked with pleading eyes. It worked but there was only so much I could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not crazy, you&#39;re grieving, and you feel guilty that you weren&#39;t in that shipping container too, all flayed and salted for your pelt to be cured, and the meat cut up into sections like the butcher shop processed them like damn it Jack.&#34; I grumbled. &#34;Take the rest of the night off Ace. You never have to worry of being called Brutos again. If I ever regain access to the MoonPack System, I&#39;ll change your name to Ace. You can make up a new house name the old one doesn&#39;t make you who you are.&#34; I said watching him hold his emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a man crying wouldn&#39;t happen unless he was completely stressed to the point he couldn&#39;t help it, but he did get up and walk away, taking my offer. In private he would likely mourn. I couldn&#39;t understand all of it, but I knew it pained him He was a vagabond by choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His people, should any be left, would take this as an opportunity to move up, rather than grieve. He lost the last of his bloodline to my knowledge, since I ordered Jack to bring them Here. He lost his pack, and worst still, there was no one to really miss. Even his mate was corrupt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach growled fuck I was starving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got up and pulled off my sweatpants. I also shifted while in town, carrying them in my mouth. Most creatures of the night saw me, trotting casually. I left Ace be when I trotted past him. He was shifted as well, laying in the grass, talking to a security bear-shifter. He wasn&#39;t shifted, sporting a uniform and badge. I feel like since bears don&#39;t really form packs, they just live near each other that maybe he felt more comfortable talking about all this to a neutral party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slipped into the forest, and heard a bit of a commotion. Vampires were out in the woods tonight, and they&#39;d likely ordered the humans I scented to hunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady Lancaster, the hour head start has 4 minutes left.&#34; Said one of her subordinates. She was the ruler of them in this place I could tell why. She had to have been turned a little after the War to scent so strongly. That would make her thousands of years old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a blonde, pale as paper in the waning moonlight. Her eyes were a rich violet, while her nails looked like they&#39;d been grown out to be claws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Lord Kaizen.&#34; She bowed. I was my full height with my flame out. I towered over them, as they were formally mortals, so they were mortal heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted. They wouldn&#39;t understand wolf speech. &#34;Just Kaizen is fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their hunger made my mouth water. They all surrounded me as they kneeled, but I would not join their hunting raid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked me in my eyes while I shimmied on my sweats. &#34;I couldn&#39;t do that with the master&#39;s blood someone so high in a place like this As one turned by King Victor himself, I still have contact with him I could plead your case to him or her majesty.&#34; She bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I would not want a war between the vampires and werewolves.&#34; I mumbled. She laughed like a rich noble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my, no. I know my masters. My King nor the Great One would allow such a thing.&#34; She said referring to my Uncle Xaxas. He created the vampire curse They feared him greatly, enough that I knew if I asked it, they would do whatever it is I request</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need anything other than meat. I Was going to go hunting for game, but I know it&#39;ll be bad because of all the commotion I Already hear.&#34; I said shaking my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They scream in fear of the Dark, the timer hasn&#39;t gone off yet. All 10 of my flock are here.&#34; She motioned them. Indeed, 10 other vampires were silent and in submissive stances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you all have 11 humans out there?&#34; I asked as the timer went off. They didn&#39;t move until I gave a nod. All but one anyway. That was probably her Beta. He was slender and lanky, being a white haired vampire, a rarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually 13. I need 2 since it&#39;s been 6 monthsWe&#39;re never full but I Try I really do, but my lord forgive me if all that&#39;s left is meat.&#34; She said floating  something only *strong* vampires could do. I could hear her just the same, like I can with everyone else. She did that to impress me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll wait here then if you all think you&#39;ll find a buck. I don&#39;t want mortal.&#34; They bowed at my request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is an honor &#34; She bowed deeply, and I had to wave my hand to get her to rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are all but the playthings of the master and his blood.&#34; She bowed. &#34;Whatever you desire, it is a privilege to present it. Mr. Ermond, retrieve a morsel for the young master.&#34; She said over her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, my lady.&#34; Bowed her Beta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She floated off while the one who stayed with her ran on all 4&#39;s. interesting. He scented like her, so I knew she was the one who turned him. That was his mistress, her Beta. That was how things usually went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat at their little meeting site. Now that they weren&#39;t all ravenous and surrounding me, I noticed this place had to be their regular spot. There was an area for processing the meat. A portable meeting tent with a table, and buckets for leftover blood, along with bone saws were in there. Their tent was painted black, and the campfire area was well maintained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take them long to bring a live buck like I asked I didn&#39;t Want to eat man&#39;s meat but  I craved fresh</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was glad it wasn&#39;t a mortal. Not with the small mate I have. It would be Wrong to continue to consume them if other options were available. It was mesmerized until I had it in my hands. It wiggled and squealed violently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be Silent in the young master&#39;s presence Meat.&#34; Hissed Lady Lancaster&#39;s Beta, bewitching the small beast again. &#34;I can buy blood in the morning sire.
