                <p>Eternya</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A/n: This will have 2 parts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat on the roof of Misfit&#39;s packhouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eskaal sat up here with me, surveying the land of the Lord Kaizen, to better understand and stabilize the complex little village they had underground for the humans. Of all the master&#39;s generals, he was the *only* one I actually feared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t even of divine blood, being only a yellow eyed beast elf from Africa. He looked like  his father, the Beast King Rau; dark skinned, muscular, though he grew his locks out to his fucking ankles now, instead of cutting them like Rau did. The Beast King renounced him for siding with the master I think all our peoples did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who could blame them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We killed, ate, and fucked on mass. No virgin, temple, nor city was safe. No follower of the sun could sleep well during the night, not without *Quality* priests versed in scripture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t because of his strengthOf all the master&#39;s generals, he&#39;d killed the most people, most times without even lifting a finger. Yet, he was just a beast elf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was his intelligence I feared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was why he was ranked above me, and I never questioned him, not after he put me in my place The man made everything from all the great plagues to flesh monsters like gorse, hog-cats, and Grahkes, the Flayed One. The giant flying snake was crimson in color, and served as Eskaal&#39;s steed from the Realm King&#39;s private island. Well, the teleportation from the master&#39;s home in Jentucky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also sat on the roof with us. We had beers brewed by Eskaal I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be able to go home today, but I did try to remain alert. This wouldn&#39;t be the first time I was slacking like this. The mortal form of the Crimson Serpent was a pale, burgundy haired man. Technically he *really* shouldn&#39;t be drinking, but it&#39;s incredibly rare to get a ticket in the air. You&#39;d have to fly over an on-patrol officer, AND land, something I&#39;ve *never* done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They can&#39;t catch me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still can&#39;t believe you&#39;re married.&#34; Said Grahkes. &#34;You used to party for weeks on end, answering summons still in bed with women.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like you haven&#39;t.&#34; I chuckled, taking a swig it was strong. I&#39;d only had 3 bottles, yet I was hammered enough that if I got caught, I&#39;d be made to clock out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I corrected it by heating my blood, and exhaling the excess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I was sober damnit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was strange too&#34; I looked down on my wife. She was outside with Flora, and the children of my lord and lady. If I was put here the rest of time, it wouldn&#39;t bother me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How so?&#34; Asked Eskaal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Beast Prince was a man of numerous talentsI still remember his oath to the master. I remember saying something pretty smartass, along the lines of &#39;he has no power, why&#39;s he here?&#39; and within seconds, he figured out not only how my flames worked but he extinguished them On Purpose with a finger snap when I flew off. I fell from the sky that afternoon and died impaled with a fucking tree through my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even knows the complex technique of entering closed worlds. He can open nearly any gate, but he couldn&#39;t pick the masters&#39; locks  Specifically the Moon Goddess. Her imprisonment kept the old master in his realm, because her life was threatened</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You remember.  Before it meant nothing They were toys Treats after a long day.&#34; I said seriously I wasn&#39;t like that anymore, and hadn&#39;t been a few decades.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I learned my lesson twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But back then, I gave my favorites pet names, and let them go with enough gold to live comfortably when it was time to move on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that didn&#39;t happen for my daughter, who smiled and played. She was born to a concubine and left orphaned because of my carelessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye.&#34; Said Grahkes. &#34;The offer still stands master.&#34; He bowed to his maker, and Eskaal shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I don&#39;t care about love, but I want it to be special Like in the novels I&#39;ve been reading.&#34; He grinned. &#34;I really liked The Prince&#39;s Prisoner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both groaned. I rolled my eyes too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh come on! It happened for you, Mr. Horny Bird.&#34; Eskaal huffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.I could get you a slave?&#34; Said Grahkes. He looked so giddy about it too, the little shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sometimes I wonder if giving you speech a mistake, you sneaky little shit.&#34; Warned Eskaal. That soured the mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry sir.&#34; He said bowing to us. He got bonked on the head gently with the cardboard box he brought the drinks in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be smarter; what did I say?&#34; Eskaal asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think before I speak.&#34; He said looking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Let&#39;s go check the demi realm.&#34; I offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34; Said Eskaal. &#34;I needed to check the borders of it anyway. You don&#39;t know realm magic, but basically if it isn&#39;t stable, it will force itself to be in spite of its unstable nature. It will drain the area around it until it&#39;s baren, then explode.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure I&#39;m sure Lord Kaizen won&#39;t be too happy about that.&#34; I chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think you can fly straight?&#34; Asked Grahkes he slurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. It&#39;s only a 10 minute walk.&#34; I said shaking my head. &#34;Plus, I should stay.&#34; I pointed to the girls with the twins. At all times, they must be guarded. It was why I was stationed here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They left with a teleport, and I could hear Eskaal screaming &#39;no&#39; as if he were chastising a bad pet I chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that?&#34; asked Elinore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grahkes can&#39;t hold his liquor.&#34; I chuckled. I stayed on the roof. Unlike the rest of them, I can see into the forest from here. If I squinted, I&#39;d see the mortal road too. Not much passes my eagle vision, but my wife&#39;s ass was a distraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come down here!&#34; She giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I obliged. She put flowers on my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a reason why you crowned me?&#34; I asked amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hug felt nice better than sex. I should have gotten married sooner What I felt then was fleeting compared to this With this, I had a partner, an equal, not a toy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought it looked nice.&#34; She said shyly. I kissed her on the top of the head, and chose to be corny about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*You* look nice.&#34; I said with a smile.  Seeing her blush made me grin wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I got bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vexterios, Aristaeus, why do you attack?&#34; I said picking up the small wild child. Vexterios had my shoelace half burned in his mouth. I removed it, but he wanted out of my hold. He Screamed about it too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Ma!] He complained. [ma ma Ma Ma MAA MAAAAAA!!!!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. If he keeps that up, he&#39;ll summon his parents.&#34; I said thinking out loud. I&#39;d rather not deal with pissed off royalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could take them for a broom ride.&#34; Offered Elinore. &#34;That&#39;s enough fire little ones,&#34; she giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took both the twins, and her broom levitated slowly to her I gave her a kiss on her forehead She wouldn&#39;t need riding clothes, being in so many layers. And she had a pup in each pocket of her robes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still didn&#39;t wear anything that showed her limbs I kissed every burn, and I healed what I could, but she was disfigured. Even with *my* magic, she held deep scars great lashes whipped her back from skin being melted. That was done on purpose by a petty fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t bother me though, other than wanting my talons in Ignis&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OO, we can fly with them.&#34; Said my daughter as she shifted She didn&#39;t know it, but she looked exactly like her mother Dolia. I don&#39;t even rightly remember the flame elf&#39;s true name That was the pet name I gave her. It meant &#39;spark&#39; because of the little elf&#39;s fiery attitude, pun intended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me feel guilty, because I knew I held no remorse for abandoning them, or Allivaldi and Allivakka... I was defeated, I was dead for thousands of years, yet, even if I were awake, I&#39;d have still been a shit father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no love between any of my children&#39;s mothers. Though I know I would have made sure my children didn&#39;t have to be abandoned, confused like Allivakka... or forced to lead a rebellion that honestly wasn&#39;t their fight, or at least shouldn&#39;t have been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Come on!] She encouraged Elinore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had an idea in my sour mood that thankfully they didn&#39;t see. The Beast Prince AND the Crimson Snake are Here Right Now I could tie up a loose end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have something I need to do.&#34; I jumped high in the air, and I became as big as I could I wanted to stretch, something hard to do when forced to be human shaped to fit in a human house I kind of missed carving out mountains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a thousand-foot wingspan, one could see why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WowWhat came up?&#34;  Asked Elinore. She&#39;d only seen smaller shifts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to take care of Ignis.&#34; I said in English. I HATED speaking in this form, since I sounded like a damn parrot</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I can taste your anger my lovePlease, don&#39;t destroy the coven.&#34; She said very quietly. There was a fear in her heart that I could see What else did they do to her that she won&#39;t say?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witches their hazing is brutal and unrelenting When they hate someone, they HATE them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I only knew that because of Heidi, a half witch in-law of the masters. She proudly shows her arms and legs but people do stare. Scars after all, are extremely rare on immortals</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It takes a lot of damage for the tissue to heal like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who else?&#34; I asked seriously. The flames of my molten feathers glowed, coating the ground with a red hot light. I think my gaze was too harsh. She looked at the dirt, and held the pups in her arms</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked as pitiful as a wet kitten in a thunderstorm</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carter and Gladis Redbrand That clan started it all But I don&#39;t want them to die. Don&#39;t hurt anyone except Lord Ignis You look as if you&#39;re going to kill all 24 thousand members.&#34; I motioned for her to come here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will only take what is to be taken.&#34; I said as she came to me on her broom, holding the pups. Her balance was perfect. Just in case though, I cast a feather fall spell. Should any of the 3 be dismounted, they will float gently to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sir.&#34; She said with a bowed head. I was the son of her former masterI didn&#39;t like it but bringing up that I don&#39;t like being called &#39;sir&#39; might make her even shier I don&#39;t want that either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left her in my daughter&#39;s care, and it only took 40ish minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about several hundred miles away, and I can fly almost the speed of sound if motivated. This coven was so large His brick mansion was easy enough to spot in the small city, since it had to have at least a hundred rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like packs, covens also have coven mansions. Only the elite live there, since the highest secrets and rituals were done there. The altar for my father was in the backyard, a small pseudo volcano they tossed objects into. It would be the only thing to survive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m going to enjoy this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They will all burn.</p>
