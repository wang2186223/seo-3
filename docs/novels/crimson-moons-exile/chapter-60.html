            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mate was in my arms, but it had been 2 days, and the original Kings who weren&#39;t asleep were here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still asleep because no one wanted her running around naked again. Covered in oil so it was harder to catch her. Even the Herald, who ultimately was the one to convince her to hold still, had to be careful. Compared to us, especially him, she was basically made of paper straws and wet cardboard. The High Demon was surprisingly calm about all this too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As I said we should have already left.&#34; Said Aureus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that was me in *your* arms, you&#39;d cling to me too. Plus, we needed to wait for Victor.&#34; Grumbled Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brother, Queen Samira, my sister, King Aureus, The Vampire King Victor, his mate Queen Lucia, the vampyr, a kind of living bat-shifter were all here with Wix, Jerold and Noah. Lucia was solid white in her true form, but her mortal visage was dark skinned, and he was pale as paper. He was the first vampire, turned by my uncle, who said for the sake of this world that he, and his brothers would allow us to handle it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he did, he&#39;d win in no time, but Contradiction and Judgment are opposites. After all, chaos and order can&#39;t mix. All three of them would be poor matches, especially Asanguis. Xaxas&#39;s powers of ruling reality would destroy the world Asanguis&#39;s abilities of Death would destroy all life, including all mates who can&#39;t come back so he&#39;s out, and father&#39;s abilities are similar to Xaxas, so he&#39;s out too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry for holding all of you up.&#34; Said Victor, sitting on the couch next to me, wile Lucia, his wife sat on the other side. &#34;I had to check on the other sleeping Old Ones, those who refused to conform to this world but didn&#39;t want to die. Many years ago, they were given the ultimatum, and most took it. But no one knew about Contradiction. He was hidden by the Church, and Wix&#39;s father through blood oath His lips were bound to be sealed so I can&#39;t blame Sleeping King Hadeon but the Church should have done better to contain him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were three knocks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I speak for my mortal people.&#34; Said the Man King, Rodrick stepping in my house It made the hair on my neck stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held a holy aura that could be literally tasted like silver. His black hair was bone straight, though his face looked no older than 40. He was immortal so long as he didn&#39;t die, and if he did, he reincarnates, so his visage has and can actively change. It&#39;s said that he can look as young or old as he needs, and can appear as the face of any incarnated lives he&#39;d lived &#34;I come with my master&#39;s legion to aid you. It hurts his heart to slay his son, but this world is his wife, and she holds priority. And a price must be paid to Posidion, who still weeps bitter tears, making the ocean unnavigable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had they handled this before he awakened, this might have been resolved before he killed Leviathan, the Ocean Gods&#39; son. Leviathan was a large ocean beast with metal scales, I think silver. He was known to mortals as Daven Jones, Davy Jones, Jonathan David? I never met him, since I don&#39;t think he could breathe air. Regardless, Victor looked pretty ragged, having to travel the world in 48 hours through borrowed magic and favors asked, but with coffee, he seemed to manage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry for the inconvenience.&#34; Said Rodrick Sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I for taking so long.&#34; Said King Victor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you both did me a favor as Caretaker of the Defiant Ones.&#34; Said Jerold. All Old Ones who did not oath peace were branded on their faces with my uncle Xaxas&#39;s god brand of Scales They were basically made mortal with said brand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meaning if the Sun God didn&#39;t hide Contradiction, he&#39;d have been culled or contained properly, not almost kill my fucking mate. King or Not I wanted in on this hunt</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncle Jerold and Noah were still sore, but healed enough that The Battle Bull could wield his legendary club he&#39;d left in Jentucky. It was retrieved for him, and he let it sit next to him while they shared my recliner chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle won&#39;t be coming to our impromptu summit So as his representative, I guess we should start.&#34; Said Tyson. &#34;As Standing King I shouldn&#39;t be here, however, as one who also cannot die, I will give all the aide I can.&#34; He said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re fine.&#34; Said Grace, the Dragon Queen since her mate killed his father for it. He wanted to rest, but had too many children vying for the throne until Aureus reluctantly stepped up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All help is welcome.&#34; I said shaking my head. Tyson still felt guilty for how he handled our disagreement to put it lightly. He didn&#39;t want to admit it though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; Said Jerold. &#34;I guess I&#39;ll start with what we already know. He killed Leviathan. He absorbed his energy and Herculian is almost here.&#34; He grumbled as if he held a grudge against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget he also killed Ackilees. Damn his weak ankles.&#34; Complained Wix. The Standing Golbin King could die, but he was here because this was where he lived. He&#39;d moved from his kingdom underneath the human city for peace, only for it to be broken anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t absorb their abilities, but it does make him stronger.&#34; Said Victor. &#34;As he is, it will take all of us to likely defeat and imprison him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here.&#34; Said Diana, coming in with Herculian.... smelling of him, holding his arm. Diana hid slightly behind him as if Jerold was a jealous old boyfriend too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; I scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I allowed your disrespect because of the shock of my son, but will not allow it again boy.&#34; She sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can turn your ass around if you think I&#39;ll welcome a bi-&#34; Jerold stopped me from standing. He was much faster than I remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The defense is appreciated. But right now we have to be Bigger than squabbles between each other. Her magic will be needed not her parenting.&#34; He said and she rolled her eyes, sitting in the lap of the Demigod of Strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wonder how long they&#39;d been together It explains on how easy it was to find him. The other bastards of Arviel were in hiding, as if they instinctually knew they were in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was a long time ago.&#34; Said Herculian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And when was the last time you had pleasant conversation with Arviel?&#34; I asked to start shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let the fur fly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That-It has Nothing to do with what&#39;s happening Now.&#34; He grumbled. I&#39;d seen Arviel before, only once in passing, but he looked like the man, being golden skinned and white haired, minus the glow of the Sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway.&#34; Said Jerold, somehow not exploding at them. &#34;He was seen heading west, so by now he should be in Colorada That was the last place you touched ground before the teleportation, right?&#34; Asked Jerold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, and we left the Herold because he&#39;s incompatible with my magic. But also. Earthquakes follow if he&#39;s not careful. So for the mortals&#39; sakes, he&#39;s flying back.&#34; Said Diana. &#34;His name should not be uttered, as it is an actual spell.&#34; She said to remind us. I don&#39;t recall if I&#39;d said his name out loud Maybe Willow might have, since she wouldn&#39;t know that unless she was told.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He will be unable to engage anyway. He wasn&#39;t made to do battle, not on Urth.&#34; Said Tyson. &#34;I read up on him in the archives; he doesn&#39;t just kill, he undo&#39;s the very being he slays, something that would shatter this realm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye.&#34; Said Jerold. &#34;He is the Pit given shape, not an actual being All the power that comes with his title makes him literally undefeatable, but with a heavy price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodrick managed to find a chair, and added to it. &#34;If he managed to kill Contradiction, the explosion would put a hole in the planet. The only battle ever fought with him nearly killed Lia. The Ariana Trench still holds the Mount Olympis&#39;s flesh at the bottom.&#34; He warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the Pit is deep, the greatest champion of the Lord of light, his herald, was named the Mountain. The Pit was bottomless, and the Mountain was the physical form of Mount Olympis, the very mountain that holds the gods&#39; thrones</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their power is exactly equal. The paradox of those two is that they can&#39;t exist at the same time and space. The Mountain is alive down there for peace, while Apythmenos resides in Hell. Not many knew about such a champion, but it is why peace is so important. Should this spark a war between the Light and Night, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if something like that rose up with his sword in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welp, I heard all I need to hear.&#34; I said standing and stretching. &#34;When Willow wakes up, I think it best we head out in a mortal car, find him, and contain him hopefully somewhere uninhabited.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And then the Realm King will imprison Contradiction by stamping his forehead AFTER we subdue him.&#34; Said Jerold. &#34;That&#39;s the plan anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We could agree to this. Higher hands would be too much. This world was fragile right now  Leviathan kept the ocean waters moving, and the souls of the drowned busy Now they ran amuck, sinking ships, and the ocean is a little stale, while some of it is frothed high with his father&#39;s anger. Posidian also Can&#39;t keep up.He&#39;s been weakened because his son was needed to aid him It was why he was made</p>
