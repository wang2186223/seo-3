                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In all my years I never thought I&#39;d smell that scent again. Son of unshifted blood&#34; He said the last part quietly. &#34;Who was your father?&#34; He asked. &#39;You smell like me a first generation flesh wearer&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He went by Arnold Emmet. I do not know more. My mother died while at sea We stowed away and got caught, but I&#39;ve roamed this country ever since.&#34; He said truthfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Roam no more come home with me, blood of mine.&#34; Asked Ron, the Second Seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I have a master. I go where he goes.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;When he dies, I die When he commands, I am compelled, and I am unable to go against it.&#34; He paused, collecting his words. &#34;Should you offend him I am not your packmate I am not your littermate I only share your blood. I cannot go where you go.&#34; He said this proudly It seemed like an honor for him to say those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would release you if you but ask Gillitus.&#34; I said seeing him bow. It would be hard to do, but I would release him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No master. through your power I am calm The primal urge to kill is nearly undetectable.&#34; He said as Jack silently agreed. &#34;It is something that cannot be explained to a werewolf not one who knows the taste of control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I second that.&#34; Said Jack. &#34;I do enjoy killing. So much so, that I learned how to seep into the shadows on my own with no training, nor knowledge of what it was. Death is my supperIt is my bread I would go days without eating or drinking waiting for blood, the hunt. To be pat on the back by the Reaper, for I was his entertainment while his master slept...  Their screams were, and still are my candy and no law held me. Neither wolf nor man sated this lust, but this world has become so modern even I know I will *eventually* be caught, killed, and thrown in the Pit if I had not partaken of my master&#39;s blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack became a black silhouette and phased through the bars that were solid silver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Impressive.&#34; Said Tyson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even Lord Ashital could not hold me. He said I was slippery as an eel and as voracious as a shrew.&#34; He bowed. &#34;If my master pleases. Should his majesty need me, I will answer with permission.&#34; Jack said this, wanting to be useful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We may have some things to discuss later then.&#34; Said Tyson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your father and mother, if they were of the old times. My cousin Romulus must have lived gained flesh Shift for me.&#34; Ron said to change the subject a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since they were pardoned, he knew they would come with me to Misfit. He could visit but he likely won&#39;t for political reasons. At least not until all the drama of my sentencing simmers down. I know even non-shifters were probably talking about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Gilbert did as he was told with a nod from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Did he have green eyes?&#34; asked Ron. &#34;Your face looks like his photocopy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[As green as grass.] He said in wolf and the Second Seat nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never thought I&#39;d say this.You are Gillitus, son of Romulus Stone. Should you ever wish to visit Lapis or StoneMoon, you are Welcome. I&#39;m pretty sure my son would be rather excited to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? I have more family?&#34; He asked shifting excitedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ron counted on his fingers. &#34;There&#39;s me, you, John, my grandson Harry and my granddaughter Tiffany, though she&#39;s a full witch. All of them are your full blood. Heidi, John&#39;s mate is a very accomplished Dark Witch. The Horned One only makes pureblooded creatures.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh that&#39;s interesting.&#34; Said Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Heidi and John are arriving later on today.&#34; Ron said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>---Willow----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up running. I was in a silver field, with silver plants and even some of the animals were too Wolves who saw me bowed, and when I blinked I fell out of bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[What the hell?] I said in wolf I looked at my feet I had paws the same color as my hair thankfully the door was open, but I wanted to see what I looked like first. I walked into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was a fox My eye level was the same, so I was 5 feet tall.... pony sized but on my back legs I had to be double that. I was lean and sleek with a super fluffed tail. I was one solid color, and my antlers were black They were straight but knobby like gazelle horns I&#39;d say they were half the size of Kaizen&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rested my paws on the bathroom sink and bent my head down, trying to see more detail. I really liked my fox eyes. They were a sparkling ocean blue, but the whites were black. I opened my mouth to look at my white teeth and purple tongue, but I accidently puffed a little fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[ah!] I yelled, making the lights flicker from an electrical spark that SPREAD way too fast!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[AH!] I screamed, burning the counter and bolting out the room the room was on fire</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire alarm blared and hyena shifters on seeing me shifted. They were Fucking Massive!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[An Intruder!] They screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Secure my brother&#39;s Luna!] Barked Tyson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alarms were sounded and Tyson and Kaizen were shifted together, while Grace and the golden Dragon King weren&#39;t, but they had their weapons. I tried going back up the stairs, but two women came from nowhere, using magic to put out our room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One was redheaded, while the other was black. And at the bottom of the stairs was my mate and his family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kind of just froze. And when I blinked, I was outside. The garden was nice, and I just kind of booked it. I needed them to calm down first I felt like if they got me, I&#39;d be ripped apart like a damn chew toy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re a Kitsune!&#34; Yelled Kaizen&#39;s dad</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Where&#39;s Luna Willow?&#34;] Growled Shakira the Head Hyena she was almost the size of the Second Seat I only knew that because I saw him shift. The brown wolf stood next to a slightly smaller version of himself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Where&#39;s Willow?!] Screamed Kaizen in a rage I&#39;d only seen once but his eyes were not as wild as they were that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[They&#39;re in the gardens. I&#39;ll seal them!] said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;THEM&#39;?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was in disbelief! HOW?! Of all people who should know me, it should be my *mate*!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why ME?! Everyone was so worked up, nobody thought to think &#39;hey, there&#39;s a red fox running around with the SAME HAIR COLOR as Willow!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran to the exit, blinking, then zipping Right past him as red lightning I didn&#39;t know what the hell I was doing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did he give me powers?!! I Know I wanted to fly, but not like THIS!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was in the air now, but I skidded to a halt, skidding on the ground because whatever I&#39;d done to get 10 feet in the air stopped working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woosh of teleportation shook the ground and I was surrounded the three Princes of Hell were in front and behind, but it was Kaizen who laughed first. He shifted, teleported, and hugged my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did Not want to be a &#39;kitsune&#39; anymore at this moment and my body responded nearly instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I missed you.&#34; I said shifting, and he picked me up, hugging me close to his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I missed you more.&#34; He grinned. &#34;And you commit Arson after I Just got us pardoned.&#34; He snickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Such a *serious* crime too. Look at my castle.&#34; Pointed Tyson. There was an explosion. And everything in our room was probably ruined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t let you take her.&#34; Growled Kaizen. His clawed hands held me gently, but firmly in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I&#39;m taking her.&#34; Said Tyson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stood there glaring at each other, but Kaizen didn&#39;t let me go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They growled, and then laughed.</p>

                <p>&#34;That was funny and you know it! Both of you smile!&#34; he snarled defensively.</p>

                <p>&#34;Would you like a vacation?&#34; I asked him. He looked kind of tired now that he wasn&#39;t stressing out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah, but I don&#39;t mind you all coming to Misfit.  There&#39;s peace I am going to have SO much shit to do.&#34; He huffed.</p>

                <p>Everyone disagreed with that. I did too. &#34;That&#39;s not sustainable.&#34; I said shaking my head.</p>

                <p>&#34;You *Still* hear me?&#34; I complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup.&#34; He said kissing me on the forehead.</p>

                <p>/Like this?/ I asked.</p>
