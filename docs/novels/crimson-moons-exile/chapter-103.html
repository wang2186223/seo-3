                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I returned home to the house surrounded by Secret Police and fucking angels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Fucking Church Was Here!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OH WHAT *NOW*?&#34; I pulled my hair with my free hand. Ink was still passed out, slung over my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch out, his majesty looks pissed.&#34; Said an officer They were all hanging out It made me relax a little The 10 priests were sharing doughnuts, while their leader wore white gloves. He spoke with a dark crimson haired Chief of Police.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Father was the most ornately dressed, wearing all white instead of just a white collar. If I had to guess, I&#39;d say he was about 75 or 80.  He had white hair and skin just as pale The Chief scented like a unicorn, also being pretty pale but that particular coat color was only for bicorns, the defiled unicorns. This one had to be born on a red moon. That was the only way his exposed crystal horn was still pure and shiny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed my instincts I sensed father; no one was hurt. The only emotion I got from these people, was peace..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I teleported over there, and I was handed a report a Rogue priest was dispatched by Sentinel. and the priests came in person to apologize. I handed it to the unicorn officer in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Holy shit.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bet you thought we came to make trouble. I&#39;m Father Terrance Ripley, head of Sect XII.&#34; He said shaking my wrist His touch made me uneasy, but didn&#39;t burn. He purposefully wore the gloves to be considerate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean XIII?&#34; I said almost as a question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, we&#39;re the Paranormal Team, if that makes sense. We deal more with supernatural spiritual anomalies if you will.&#34; He said being handed a doughnut box. &#34;Want one?&#34; He put one in my hand, being mindful, having it in a napkin for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t like sweets.&#34; I complained eating it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tradition demands I eat what I am served in situations like this. He was extending a proverbial olive branch, and I took it. It was just a glazed one, so I&#39;d only get a little indigestion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry. I assume your condition as a royal blood makes it hard to eat this stuff. Don&#39;t worry; it&#39;ll go to my thighs.&#34; He chuckled. Gods damn it The dad joke made me smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was becoming my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I assume you&#39;re here for more than the apology.&#34; I said walking with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You hold the attention of all XIII Sects. Along with your puppies. Lord I want to hold one.&#34; He complained out loud &#34;Wait that isn&#39;t racist or something is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I said firmly. &#34;Let&#39;s go to my office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I led him past the flabbergasted pack, and put Ink on the floor next to me when we got up there. I could understand it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Read this.&#34; He passed me documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manilla folder held within it a decree from *Every* Royal House . They were signed by Rodrick, the Holy Seat, Uriel, and the High Archangel Micheal, the mightiest of them. I care not to meat someone like him. Royal stamps from every king laid in my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was in the Realm King&#39;s writing. The Scales were in the top center, while all others were ink-stamped below his in three rows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Read it.&#34; He smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All our lives no matter how long humans were Food They were Not to be trusted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*They were The Enemy who would kill your family, and lay the rest upon the accursed Ring*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, they were allies in maintaining this world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By royal decree, no mortal, supernatural, nor creature shall interrupt the Declaration of Sanctuary. War is prohibited in any form, though, the secrecy of creatures: supernatural or magical in nature are permitted existence. This also includes all of divine blood, as I, the Realm King, deem it a bit much for mortals to know this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The disruption of the flow of this world is prohibited, as is the revelation of the existence of private citizens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From this day forward, All newly captured mortals of free origin are no longer permitted to be subject to supernatural captivity, unless it deemed by the authorities that may, that it is the most humane condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To aid this, The Stamp of Sol, the invention of King Uriel of the Unicorns will be placed upon the necks of all who are free, but compromised. Should they be stamped on the neck, and the Sign of the Sun disappear, it means that they will not remember the supernatural encounter</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the Sol Stamp may only be used once per person in their lifetime. To be caught twice is to die. That is fair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All supernaturals are to be released, and pardoned if there is no evidence that they are a threat. All mortals from this day forward are to remain ignorant, but free should they find out. They are prohibited from speaking out, and should they, then they will be collected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No supernatural is to be culled without judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No mortal is to be captive unless deemed necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost humans are to be shown the way as passively as possible. Lost, intoxicated, compromised, or otherwise innocent humans are given the protection of King Uriel, and the Peace of the Sol Stamp created by King Uriel, that they be on their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No innocent human is to be harmed for merely the threat of knowing. They must be processed Fairly by the Law, regardless of ability to remember or comprehend the gravitas of the situation. In the event of inability, they may be sent, or collected by the Church for conditioning and release. This will be done using the Sol Stamp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Church of the Sun is Sovereign. The Secret Police are responsible for keeping the peace. The Kings manage the Old Ones, and the Realm King Rules you all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any being caught as a Hunter Will Be Executed. Any being who breaks this law will be executed. Any being under the threat of death will obey, or they will be delivered to King Xaxashevaal, God of Judgment. I already deem them unworthy of breath. They will not draw a single one more should I have to leave my duties, and waste my time to deal with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I am pestered with little mortals who will not listen, they will learn I am not to be played with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last part sent a chill down my back</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now we may be secret. But in our secrecy, we could Truly be in peace. The threat of the Hunter or Church is over. Headhunters were already outlawed, but those who still don&#39;t comply will be hunted themselves.. And I assume any Church who still wish to mindlessly cull the innocent will also be hunted, like the Father that came to my pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We wouldn&#39;t let the general population know of us. But now. Oh my lord and lady my children could know what real peace felt like!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting in my chair realizing this made me happier than I let on...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Real peace not a cease fire</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a Treaty to be Hounded over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lord Kaizen?&#34; Asked Father Terrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.Would you like to meet my mate and pups?&#34; I asked. &#34;Only if my mate is alright with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t WAIT to rub it in Father Remmi&#39;s face!&#34; He beamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up. &#34;If there is to be peace, let them see we supernaturals mean our words and seals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father was in my bedroom; I could hear his heartbeat faster than mine. He was raised like a werewolf, and hunted by everyone, wolves and mortal alike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks a little too supernatural to fit in with mortals. The red eyes he was born with bring fear to werewolves His ears are slightly pointed, and his claws cannot fully retract. That was from being born on the red moon He even has an inner wolf, Venerable: King of the Forest. The black eyes of his wolf do not exist with our people He was born an outcast, given Nothing and I am the Prince who would lead the charge in this peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Son, these are your children. I am not sure.&#34; He said seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, and I think it good they know not the taste of Man if they are to live in this world. Not as I did Not so soon.&#34; I tasted men when I was still young, oddly enough I don&#39;t remember the age. I think I was an adult. But now that I have, I can never go back to being ignorant of their flavor again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put his massive hands on my shoulders. &#34;I will be right behind you I must let you be a man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard the proclamation and I saw how serious everyone is.&#34; Said Willow. &#34;My instincts scream &#39;no&#39; but I trust you.&#34; She said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kissed her on the forehead my pups slept on our bed My people lived a floor under me My father stood there next to me. If anything happened, I had other hands to lend aid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let it be known that the 1st General of Hell was the First to lay down his bow.&#34; I said kissing her softly. I scooped up my pups</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now my heart raced Fuck I put my foot in my mouth. The desire to turn around and change my mind was strong but I know I was doing the right thing. I could almost feel an invisible hand on each shoulder one was warm, the other cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took them downstairs, outside. The sun was out and a little warmer than it was a few moments ago Scary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Priest, the Chief of Police, and the Pack saw my babies. People pulled out their phones Everyone was taking pictures, or recording</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind me was the God of Retribution, and beside me was my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re precious.&#34; Said Father Terrance. I resisted my instincts to hide them or be aggressive... I had since I first saw them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are. I raise them now in peace With REAL peace.&#34; I boomed. There were claps. &#34;I know Uriel and Rodrick I Know Herculian. I I still don&#39;t believe it.&#34; I said hesitating. &#34;But for their sakes I do this. Meet my son, The Right Paw.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put Vexterios in the gloved hand of the priest. He was still asleep. He had no idea what the fuck was going on. He&#39;s a puppy. The only thing he knew right now was to drink milk and piss on my shirts, not that this moment was being photographed, or that this was history in the making.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is an honor I do not deserve This should be Uriel or Rodrick standing here maybe lord Herculian or someone else I do not feel worthy to be this trusted, but I will do my best to keep it.&#34; He handed my son back, who snored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were given to their mother, who instinctively took them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do they have to be so cute?&#34; Asked Willow. She didn&#39;t know what she was doing, but rubbing her chin on him put her scent on them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because pups are way cuter than babies.&#34; I chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The absurdity of wolves born without human shape If I wasn&#39;t one myself, I still wouldn&#39;t think it was possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The point of this was that I am the Highest Rank in Hell besides my father and uncles That I shook hands with a priest and angels That I let one of them hold them. That could have NEVER been done before today</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It just wasn&#39;t possible until now to trust a human like that There is a certain sense of relief one gets from this. I&#39;m going to raise my sons to abstain from mortal flesh. I&#39;m going to have them be raised with Herculian son, and they shall be as brothers. Because even if war does break out Uriel, Herculian and many others are Olny on this world, so they won&#39;t have to fight them. Well maybe Uriel since he is a champion but at least it won&#39;t be on Urth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least here they can live happy lives one without worry of the pack being razed, or headhunters knocking at our doors</p>
