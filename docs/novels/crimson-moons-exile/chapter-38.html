                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was taken up stone stairs, passing a sea of curious eyes All the people in the crowds were shifters</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many commented more or less that they couldn&#39;t believe &#39;good wolves died for a month&#39;s meat&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one made any attempt to correct their words, and I didn&#39;t say anything either. There would be no point. I was the only human here, but at the same time, I was surrounded by other shifters who made sure that I was in the center of their formation Inside the private booth was a woman who was so pale, that she was nearly translucent. Her hair sparkled a vibrant white, as if there was glitter in it. Her violet eyes were red as she wiped them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry we have to meet like this I&#39;m Samira the Glittering One, Tyson&#39;s mate... You must be Lord Kaizen&#39;s mate.&#34; She said shyly. She extended her hand, and I shook it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am. My name&#39;s Willow.&#34; I said being pleasant I could tell she wanted no part in this. She looked like she was trying to put on a brave face, but she wasn&#39;t fooling anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can translate what they say if they speak wolf.&#34; Said the female commander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would like that Shakira.&#34; Samira said with a small smile. &#34;I told him to find another way, that our people would be upset at first if he was slapped on the wrist, but know that he made the right decision I know your first impression of him is This, but he cares deeply for his family He wants to do right so bad&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I respect that, but his righteousness has made everyone&#39;s life harder. Dragging this out won&#39;t give his people closure.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed many of the pack have pleaded for Lord Kaizen, stating that he wouldn&#39;t have attacked for No reason. Saving your mate is universally understood.. Tyson told me what you said about the fence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yet look. I can&#39;t hear them, but I know they&#39;re going to fight anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We watched them take off their clothes and circle each other They looked so identical, that I couldn&#39;t tell them apart I&#39;d know up close but as it was the voice of the king was like listening to Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn, I&#39;m so late, and Xaxas isn&#39;t here yet.&#34; Said an Enormous man that had to be their father. Kaizen&#39;s older, more scarred twin stood there as wide as a building and just as tall, sitting in one of the chairs. His horns were double my mate&#39;sand between them was a flaming, floating crown meaning he probably could stop this if he wanted. He gently shook wrists with me, and both of us sat down next to him He felt like the dream I had of Death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re fine sir.&#34; I said politely. &#34;I&#39;m Willow.&#34; I said having to look up. He was a beast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. &#34;I am Bryson. Don&#39;t worry about my titles and such.&#34; He shook my hand. It was soft, yet a heavy weight was on my shoulders. He may as well could have been a mountain. If he was some kind of God of Justice, it would put a definition to this feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was hugged by who had to be Kaizen&#39;s mother. She felt hot to the touch, so much so I wondered how she wasn&#39;t sweating... &#34;I&#39;m sorry we&#39;re meeting like this; I know Samira feels the same! I&#39;m Isabelle.&#34;  She was taller than me by her head and shoulders. &#34;Bryson look at her, she&#39;s Adorable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about 6 feet tall, having thick frizzy hair that went to her hips. It went from black to a blazing orange, like it was hot metal, not dyed  She was more tan than her mate, but he looked much more disapproving that she was babying me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryson grunted. &#34;She isn&#39;t a pup.&#34; He said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hugged a little harder, hugging me one more time before she whispered in my ear. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. We have a plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s why we aren&#39;t down there.&#34; Said Bryson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Kaizen-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood in the center of the arena, looking up at Willow, who stood with Tyson&#39;s mate They did that so she was protected, but I knew my brother. He likely wouldn&#39;t want her blood on his hands until after I was dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to do this.&#34; Said Tyson. &#34;But I will.&#34; He said low enough that only I heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liar.&#34; I scoffed. He ignored to address his people</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone.&#34; He yelled like the Alpha he was. &#34;My brother wishes trial by combat. So I must list his crimes. For 25 counts of murder, 2 counts of aggravated abscondence, and 25 counts of said murders being on the Harvest Moon, the Night of Peace,And killing Lupe, the 14th Seat, his mate, and his pups-&#34; I cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They threatened the Crown! Your life specifically!&#34; I yelled; there were Boo&#39;s. &#34;I even sent you their confession. They weren&#39;t being tortured or anything. They were so Proud too. And those wolves threatened my mate!&#34; I yelled. &#34;You waste your breath. Fight Me you Damn Dirty-&#34; He cut me off by screaming at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must condemn you!&#34; He pointed. &#34;Should you lose, I will kill you.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;Plead your case, that I may consider if my ruling is fair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I *already* pleaded my case. You *KNOW* your ruling is neither just nor fair.&#34; I boomed as an Alpha myself. &#34;I did what I did to protect my mate. Had they not broken the law Had they just detained her, I would have come home, been told they had humans in intake, and I would have ruled they be shipped to Horizon Prison but kept my mate. To be fair, turning them wouldn&#39;t have been a bad idea either, but I Can&#39;t because they were already partially eaten when I got there.&#34; I snarled. I shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyson did as well  We were equals, down to the flicker of our flames Even they were in sync It was like looking in a mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Had you come for a trial, I might have been able to pardon you.] he growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[You and I Both know that is a lie. By Blood and Fangs, I challenge trial by combat.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see I saw the victims&#39; families in the crowd. They looked Disgusted. They were likely in denial that their loved ones had done wrong I shook my head and planted my feet in a ramming position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He charged first, and we clashed, butting horns. I was immediately clawed by him on the arm after the smash. Our powers don&#39;t work on each other, yet my arm held a gash the thickness of a thumb. I clawed him in response, not holding back. I got his left flank, and some of the fur hung off his partially flayed body. I could feel what I&#39;d done to him as if we were still connected</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was excruciating</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both healed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd roared The sea of smiling faces and people waving money. It weighed on me to see them so gleefully betting who&#39;d kill who and how.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[They do not even mourn, yet we tear each other apart.] I said seeing my mate&#39;s horrified face. I could not hear her screams over the excited multitudes Our parents honored our wishes by looking neutral. They neither cheered nor lamented I wonder how they truly felt about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Look at Me!] He snarled, either not looking to avoid the feelings of doubt and shame or because he was so focused on killing me. We circled with our heads low, and the air was thick with our bloodlust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was no longer my brother, and this is why I was Beta I never had the heart to do this not seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We but heads with our full force, and the shockwave could be felt underfoot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[For my mate&#39;s sake you&#39;ll get what you&#39;re asking for.] I said charging him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We reared on hind legs but he could not push me down like he used to. He weighs the same as me now meaning that he&#39;d lost some of his condition. He was the bulkiest of the three of us now it seemed he was leaner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We circled in a trot before charging again. Our horns made the sound of billiard balls, crashing into each other, our fangs ripped meat off bones, and I got him by the left leg. I shook hard enough to break it, but he healed himself nearly instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We danced on back legs, clawing and gnashing teeth I managed to get him by the throat and struck him with all the lightning I could muster. I clamped down with all my might, and he struggled if only for a moment before he got my shoulder, and dislocated it. The pain made me loosen my grip... The force of us both shaking gave him an opening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Hell&#39;s flames nor Royal Blood&#39;s bite works on either of us!] He growled, snapping at me, missing, but his claws didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slashed at my throat, something that would have killed anyone else, and myself if I&#39;d have laid down like a damn dog. Losing blood was not something I could heal so fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But since I lived, it seemed we could not kill each other nor could we hurt each other, yet with every slash, the crowd slowly lost their bloodlust They stopped being so enthusiastic about the blood sport and That Said Something coming from a crowd of shifters. It became silent  and they became horrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dirt under us became bloody mud</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire we breathed scorched all it touched My lightning made me tired, and his slashes held a silver quality to them since they glowed so brightly. But we kept exchanging heavy blows. Both of us were getting tired, yet neither of us would back down. Both of us had too much to lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I lost, Willow would be at the mercy of my brother. I couldn&#39;t risk that. MisfitMoon was already discovered. My mate and pack depended on my victory.</p>
