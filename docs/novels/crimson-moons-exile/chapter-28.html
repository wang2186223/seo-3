                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing that raced in my head as I shot through the sky was could I take an angel</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could I hold myself up to one who is probably older than the War? One who wore silver armor and held a solid silver sword.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the Fuck do I do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one could keep up with me, since I was red lightning. It uses a lot of energy I didn&#39;t have. But for her I pushed myself. I made a mistake staying here, dropping my guard This place did feel like a pack, and with my mate, I would have made this place a home. I feel like I can&#39;t now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel like no matter how much loyalty and love there was from my wolves, everyone else wanted my hide in one way or another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I marched into the security station, and he was already in his armor. This place was a generic county jail on the inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you Do to my Mate?&#34; I snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, not even a spell.&#34; He said in full armor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no question if I could take him. The answer was &#39;no&#39; without armor. I had a bow I could summon to keep a distance, but he would likely stay in my face during combat so he could slash me with Light blessed silver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you do all This?&#34; I demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For you to share words, it seems I might have been wrong.&#34; He mumbled. &#34;Forgive me. You act suspiciously. You share your blood and make yourself Two minions upon getting here the amount you need to open a portal to Hell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the Fuck would I do that?!&#34; I screamed at the top of my lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. How the Fuck Should I Know Demon?!&#34; He yelled back. &#34;The last time I allowed someone as strong as you live here, all the mortals were turned to vampires, and my house was burned down.&#34; He grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe ASK! Jack and Gilbert needed to be bound. They vow loyalty in blood, but My blood keeps them from their true nature without my say. You&#39;d know that if you would have texted me.&#34; I said marching past him, but he stopped me from opening the door to my mate. &#34;Move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; he said firmly. It made me see red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I&#39;m Not whoever it was that pissed you off. Release my mate.&#34; I snarled. &#34;You Break the Law. Mates are not to be in the affairs of the divine.&#34; I said feeling my flame flicker. My uncle ruled away mates being taken after the Moon Goddess was freed. He didn&#39;t want his mother to ever go through that again, nor anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True, but I&#39;m not divine enough to count. You Are though, so I made sure to just have her on the other side of a mortal door. Nothing supernatural, nothing dangerous there&#39;s pie too. Humans like sweets.&#34; He said briefly looking at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Release her.&#34; I demanded with every ounce of control I had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Again No; her safety is still in question.&#34; He motioned me. &#34;I can&#39;t rightly let you run to her still popping with enough electricity to blow the power out of the neighborhood. If you touch her, you&#39;ll kill her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You made me this way I was wrapping up culling the mindless minotaur, something YOU as Security should be doing. you know how many bodies I had to burn how many innocent lives were lost out there? I counted at least 15.&#34; I said pushing past him and ripping the door off its hinges</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I protect all Within the walls. I&#39;m contracted to protect that and that Only.&#34; He said a little upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t care about his excuse. My mate was being held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at me innocently with a sandwich in her mouth The room was soundproof. Her blank expression told me that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got up and came to hug me, but I stepped back before she could. &#34;Hold on.&#34; I said showing her my sparking hands. She skidded to a stop. Tamriel was right. I closed my eyes, and walked to her, and I hugged her gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you hurt?&#34; She asked, thinking that we&#39;d fought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No; we decided not to.&#34; I said shooting him a glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve seen all I need to.&#34; He said vanishing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen. What did he have in that folder?&#34; Asked Willow. Shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t lie to you, it&#39;s bad.&#34; I mumbled. &#34;Jack ran an errand for me He brought the last of the House of Finnand Here. I need to interrogate them.&#34; I motioned her to come with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it a bad idea? Fuck yes it was, but I couldn&#39;t find myself sending her away. Not after he tricked her into coming here, and put her in essentially a cell</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran my clawed hands through my hair</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear them argue</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lupe I Know you had to open your big mouth!&#34; yelled his granddaughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my knowledge Lupe&#39;s true mate was killed by Brutus and his only daughter, the heir that would inherit his seat, was assassinated by him too. That&#39;s how the Finnand weaseled in two seats, the 3rd And 14th. No other royal house has such power, or should I say had?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be Silent Martha.&#34; He hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s right.&#34; Said his grandson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up Kyle!&#34; She snarled. They growled at each other while their stepmother sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was likely the only other male left. Lupe, the 14th Seat&#39;s new mate was silent in all this. Those weren&#39;t her grandpups, and unlike normal wolves They had no loyalty or sense of adoption of pups that weren&#39;t biologically theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. The snakish ways of Brutus ran Deep in that bloodline. The houses of Finnand and Grisham merged a long time ago, but they acted more like jackals than wolves</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would if you&#39;d have fought that fiend, instead of Bowing Down. Some Council Member.&#34; She hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re young. You had no idea.&#34; Lupe said likely shaking his head. &#34;Jack is sadistic&#34; He mumbled. &#34;He kills for the fun of it, and I am no match. I would rather surrender and be here, than be dragged here anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good choice.&#34; I said interrupting them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lupe held gray hair, a normal wolf color, while his mate&#39;s hair was more peppered with black. The redheaded pups looked more or less exactly like Ace... and his stepmother looked at me as if I were dirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The King will come for us.&#34; Lupe hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if he Does, you&#39;ll probably be dead.&#34; I said grabbing a random chair in front of the cell. &#34;Now tell me why you intend on marrying off your bloodline to the 6th Seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your majesty your greatness is wasted.&#34; Said Martha bowing, looking at my still out cock. I sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see you have a mate now.&#34; Said Lupe. I know he scented her upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t change the subject.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not? We&#39;re going to die here.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That goes without saying, but Maybe what you say will reach Tyson&#39;s ears. Maybe your kin will keep OilMoon. Tell me Why you wanted to pair Jang with Martha.&#34; I demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We plot nothing.&#34; He lied, but unfortunately, I can&#39;t force him to say anything. Even if I could compel him with my powers, it wouldn&#39;t count.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jang gives you lot access to the Upper Court.&#34; I said firmly. &#34;It gives you access to the King&#39;s sleeping chambers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The King cannot die.&#34; He said revealing that he knew the &#39;secret&#39;. To become the king, you must kill him in Fair combat taking his heart would still inconvenience him though. It would make his rest a little harder to get up from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WellJang is available. Martha&#39;s mate is an Omega, my son&#39;s mate was rejected as well no pup of Mine is marrying a damn Human.&#34; He hissed. His wolf agreed with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lost my temper, but I was silent a moment. I intimidated his wolf with my flame between my horns, and I think I would get a confession out Tack, his wolf. Inner wolves for the most part are honest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Again, you try to change the subject. You won&#39;t bait me by talking about how humans are lesser. Tell me why you want to kill Tyson so bad.&#34; I said glaring him in the eyes. His wolf came out, but he refused to let him speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want no such thing.&#34; He said looking at his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was silent. He looked around for cameras, but couldn&#39;t see it. I&#39;d ask for the footage from this to send to my Ungrateful brother. &#34;Your thoughts already give you away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s so Pure.&#34; His wolf snarled. &#34;It is like I&#39;m working under a damn Unicorn! And what&#39;s worse is that his mate IS a damn unicorn. Reform, Bah!&#34; He snapped. &#34;I have to cater to a pup who doesn&#39;t even know how to govern and bow to a woman who is Not Luna material. He is no king. She is no queen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Interesting choice of words.&#34; I said turning to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen, what are you going to do with that information?&#34; Asked Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, aren&#39;t you interested in the details?!&#34; He yelled. &#34;I&#39;ll give you the other conspirators for my life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Jack./ I linked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Yes boss?/ he sounded Excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/You get to have your way tonight. Mail them to the palace with the confession tape in a zip lock bag./ I said calmly. They knew my mate was mortal now I don&#39;t like leaving lose ends. If it got out, with my status as banished, there&#39;s no telling what would happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was already too trusting too. I shook my head before I lost it. My horns were already out, and the flame demanded blood. Not literally, but figuratively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You aren&#39;t going to say anything?! What if I was lying?!&#34; He yelled as I walked out the door. I compelled him to blurt, but not with my powers His wolf was just intimidated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked home, but it was also apparent that Willow Wasn&#39;t satisfied with the results.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do this so that Tyson can see for himself the Real priorities. While he&#39;s worrying about Just me, he should be managing his royal nobles. They plot behind his back. I know he knows this, but now with proof, maybe he can do his fucking job.&#34; I grumbled.</p>
