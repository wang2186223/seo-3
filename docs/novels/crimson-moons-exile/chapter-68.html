                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe? Arviel was not satisfied that she found a small Grecian island, and that Jerold was healthy. This was meant to be her suffering penance to watch him die, or hurt those &#39;round him, including her. Though some say she was killed by demons despite mating Torrus and smelling of him even to this day with the Horned One so angered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerold ripped the heavens apart to get her back from Purgatory. Back then, there was no veil Some say she went straight to hell, but if that was the case, how did he manage to get her back? He&#39;s why the Spirit World has Grendel, the First Wolf, as its gatekeeper.  The Sleeping Wolf King Ashital is merely the first to have flesh form, being his first son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow that&#39;s a lot of drama.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye.&#34; He said pouring a glass of white wine meant for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat there in the recliner chair in front of the Tv, casually swirling it. &#34;Elivitas.&#34; He said raising the glass, and the white wine became black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry. I don&#39;t partake.&#34; I said trying to decline, but his stern face told me that wasn&#39;t happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You fear the magic, and more importantly the smell reminds you of your past. Your friends are in likely Haven being mortal, so long as they weren&#39;t bad people.&#34; He said factually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do to it?&#34; I asked letting him keep it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s an energy regeneration spell. It lifts the spirits, and heals pain. If you want I could cast Levitas on you, but this is safer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll just drink water.&#34; I mumbled. It looked like syrup now, and watching his face as he drank it made me want it Even Less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More for me. I&#39;m finally getting a buzz.&#34; He chuckled, downing that bottle too.. &#34;I assume you want to continue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do&#34; I said still sitting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All the while I flew at the master&#39;s right, under his great steed, the now God of Death. We killed so many I can&#39;t rightly put a number on it. But I thought I was careful with the women.&#34; He mumbled. &#34;I must have missed a concubine after my defeat, and my orders changed to rest and retreat Oh well.&#34; He said looking briefly upstairs. &#34;Had she not willingly pledged to any of the masters, I&#39;d have had no qualms about doing what I needed to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I only knew a sliver of information about Eternya&#39;s last known child. She tried destroying this world, but as punishment, they were sent away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is it so important what side she&#39;s on?&#34; I asked. &#34;Is it because of your past children?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me as if I asked a stupid question. The Answer was &#39;yes&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not stupid, you&#39;re Young. So young that most your age don&#39;t think of children.. There is peace and a truce now, but should war break out, I don&#39;t want to get attached to those who will become my targets. This place stinks of angel. This place is Blessed by the Light, since his son slept here. We Are Not the good party. We Are the Night&#39;s Chosen. You will not see war, being so small, but your mate will, as will your children when you have them. Do you think you&#39;d be alright with Lord Kaizen slaying your sons? It won&#39;t be a matter of negotiation either.&#34; He said factually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up at the room again, as if he were relieved that wasn&#39;t the case regardless of his harsh words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mistress Harmony softened my heart. Well, to be more honest, she gave me the out I needed to get soft in the first place. The master in the past held this world under his undefeatable thumbAll who did not kneel were fodder at worst, discarded toys at best. It&#39;s nice to relax... To be in the sky for days raining down literal fire and lava was fun, but it gets stale. I already know how to maintain their measly little lives as I tortured them for years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get that he was out for revenge The Moon Goddess was imprisoned.. .but why torture people?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll put it like this: I am the General of The God of Judgment. I do not question why he wants something. My orders drive my feet. Master needed information. I squeezed everything they knew out of them. How they screamed I even learned how to-&#34; He paused. &#34;It becomes boring, like a movie you&#39;ve already seen twice compared to all the new stuff now.&#34; He grinned. &#34;The first thing to go would be technology. Mortals weren&#39;t meant to know any of this stuff after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34; I said looking down. It was as if humans weren&#39;t even people to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They weren&#39;t; Come sit Flora. I know you were listening too.&#34; He said responding to me.  Eternya also watched Flora come downstairs silently. &#34;At least now the free may pursue their happiness, while the farmed give the ultimate, unwilling sacrifice for the sake of peace in my mistress&#39;s words...I believe their reward is Haven. since well the way their kept. I don&#39;t rightly know if they know anything beyond their cells.  Before the Master&#39;s mercy, all were dust beneath his feet, hardly worth blinking at should one die. Now through the Mistress, he at least offered a solution that keeps the world as it is now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flora added to this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember taking in all the orphans I could once I was able. Generations of mortals were made homeless, because the cities they escaped no longer existed. I hid them from my people, while the Dragon King ruled over us. He wasn&#39;t cruel. Well not *too* cruel, but I led a resistance. The mortal world was harsh. Much harsher than it is now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many pregnant women without husbands were accused of witchcraft, even though only those born with powers can use it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who actually did love demons, or supernaturals, were treated the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The retaliation from those who loved their mortal wives rocked the countryside too Many small battles spilled more blood until about 40% of the human population was left, and about 45% of supernaturals including all what the Realm King decimated</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any hybrid born, any indication that you weren&#39;t all human could land you behind bars, and many supernaturals were wary of hybrids, because the Really human looking ones were SNAKES.&#34; She hissed angrily. She took a breath, and continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lastly there was the Plague of undeath The dead rose filled with vengeance, angry that they died without resolution. They killed the living and ripped them apart, but with the Realm King&#39;s hand off this world, about half didn&#39;t rise from being turned undead. It was as if his sleep made their curse inactive partially.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was I think around the time I married Asmondi The dead in their mass graves were forced to pass on, but the plague of illness rocked the world too. But it was almost a blessing, because the Treaty Of 1605 came not too long after that. However, by then I was out of this world&#39;s affairs  So I might be wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was defeated and sleeping during all this.&#34; Said Eternya. &#34;I&#39;ve heard some of this though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>----Kaizen-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Diana&#39;s turn to drive, since we didn&#39;t stop because it was late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ate the Whipper Jr</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..It. was. Amazing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d had human food before, but not this flavorful..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So about that Truce.&#34; Grinned Herculian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;..*Fine*.&#34; I mumbled eating my 9th one. He refused to take my money when we got to the window Again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were 18 hours into a 20 hour drive to Dead Vally The first one he gave me with the extra bacon and cheese I&#39;m coming home with 40 more of these. The pack must know</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We need a Hamber Royalty or any other place that had stuff we could eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have more places to show you! I can&#39;t wait!&#34; He smiled. It was almost infectious if not for my stubbornness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sound so happy about this.&#34; I complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean, I know I&#39;m gonna die in the next 3 hours; why not have a good last meal.&#34; He said cheerfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t say that.&#34; Growled Diana. &#34;I I opened my heart to you. You better not.&#34; She scolded him like that was something he could help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babe, he is going to be naturally resistant to my abilities, plus I&#39;ve seen the aftermath of Leviathan  those who are in Arviel&#39;s good grace receive additional damage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That makes no sense.&#34; I blurted. &#34;Blood Kin are Allies oh right.&#34; I said feeling a little stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Lord of Contradiction will make War with his potential allies, and Seduce his enemies into aiding his cause. After all, a brother is more likely to help another brother, than a demon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We champions will be immune to that.&#34; Said Rodrick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Herculian go home.&#34; Said Diana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; He said simply. &#34;If I die, I die. I&#39;ll be back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you won&#39;t I saw Leviathan&#39;s corpse too. He was a Husk. Absorbed. Contradiction is an Eater of Souls, yet he&#39;s made of mortal&#39;s Flesh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a general&#39;s boon from Grandfather; so I should be fine. Herculian if you die, I&#39;m pissing on your grave.&#34;  I warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed. &#34;Just let me do this. I want to be at least One Hercule who&#39;s not a fucking meathead, idiot, philanderer, or asshole.&#34; He grumbled. &#34;Do you know how many of me there are? How many &#39;herks&#39; there are on different worlds? Millions. Literally Millions of Just Copies of METhere&#39;s Millions of half-brothers too.Countless ones, one on almost every world. Go to Ei-arth and bring back Herculeas. He&#39;s not a bad one. He&#39;s *really-really* short though.&#34; He chuckled. She didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. I didn&#39;t want you because you were a demigod I know of the countless bastards of the Sun. I wanted you because you wouldn&#39;t break.&#34; She hissed. He tried to pet her hair and she bit him pretty hard. He yelped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I promise if I Do die, I won&#39;t get eaten.&#34; He said with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; She said this silently like a little kid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was cashing a check with his mouth his ass can&#39;t cashI sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess instead of teaming with Rodrick, I need to watch You.&#34; I grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See I Knew we would be friends.&#34; He beamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gods.&#34; I face palmed. &#34;Why do you look so happy about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I might get to pet you.&#34; He said happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will Not touch my fur!&#34; I said angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When they were small, they were so fluffy. Look what his majesty sent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait who?!&#34; I yelled. &#34;Who Betrayed Me?!&#34; I demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lord Tyson.&#34; She grinned passing him the poison</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My reputation as a fierce Warrior was ruined by Sailor Photos! Damn it Mom! Why did I have to be *Cute* ?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Herculian Squealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AH! So Fluffy!&#34; He said with a wide grin The meathead was wholesome  He literally made himself glow with the thought of touching my fur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I will NOT demean myself by being Fucking Petted!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I texted Tyson; I didn&#39;t care that I had no signal. If Contradiction doesn&#39;t kill him, I will!</p>
