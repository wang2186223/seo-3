                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was told that he only wanted 2 hours of my time, and in return, he&#39;d compensate me with 10,000 gold. So of course, I accepted the side quest. I bit the coin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was glad I played hard ball He thought I wasn&#39;t coming, initially.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aris&#39;s realm It was oddly beautiful. It was a great, mostly untamed forest with roman cities scattered around. Great Grecian pillars and statues littered a path to a coliseum at least the size of five city blocksAll over were skeletons, meaning that he did allow them flesh at some point</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That. That sparked my interest, because now I was confused. Could I eat them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what did they taste like? Probably gamey. Males always taste kind of bad. It&#39;s why bull meat is castrated in the states. I assume the testosterone levels of an eternal warrior will make them taste like shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted. Why&#39;d I have to sour my own mood? Bleh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t like I&#39;d deny fresh meat though but still They&#39;re going to be stringy and gross.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I totted down the path, and before long, I saw a line of people buying tickets My name was on a damn billboard. &#39;Featuring the First General of Hell VS the Tenfold.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interesting that had to be his best group or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They made way for me, though some reached out to touch my fur. They put their blood on their hands and pressed it to their white robes, which I thought was weird, but this was a warrior realm honor, blood, and sacrifice will be upheld above all else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dishonorable fighting was likely punishable by Aris himself. I couldn&#39;t see him allowing it, regardless of their quirky encounter and that being the first time I ever spoke with the god. It&#39;s hard to see them as that anyway</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve seen them too casually, and too often. There is no reverence, merely respect that they are higher. I see them more as great Alphas than anything divine. I see Xaxas&#39;s realm more as his territory, and I am his subordinate packmate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus I&#39;ve seen them bitch and complain too. And behave unbefitting of their titles. Mortals never see this. They have no idea that Xaxas likes junk food. Offer him that and he&#39;d do whatever. Act as a child to the Horned One, and he&#39;ll scoop you up and adopt you Asanguis likes pets and being told he&#39;s a good boy. But that&#39;s only with Nixxia. To get him most of the time being sick with something terminal gains his pity. I&#39;ve seen him shed tears for a dropped sandwich too so I don&#39;t know how far his sympathy actually goes and for what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Announcing the Visiting 2,932,299th Trainor, Second Duke of Demons, First General of Tarteron, Grandson and one of the favored children of Half-King Zuviel, Lord Kaizen, the Horned Wolf, the Charred One!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t entered yet, but as I did. There were SO many people So many different races too. Some I&#39;d never seen before. Their roars were deafening. Even in the crowd, many were in armor, as there was a sign that mentioned that if you gain the attention of Aris, you may be teleported at random to participate. Every single man and woman were at top performance</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each one was lean and toned. If they had other forms, they were already shifted, sitting in special seats to accommodate drakes, werewolves, and even a unicorn or two There were no children. This is a warrior only world. To die in battle is the only way here, that or to be a great warrior of renown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I howled to be a ham.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They loved it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Bring me my meat!] I trotted in the circle. I hammed it up. I knew that&#39;s what they wanted, and I wouldn&#39;t sour the mood of his adoring followers. It would make grandfather, who was next to Aris with my pups mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait a minute Willow was up there too! And my parents.I could see mom Laughing at me with Harmony! They were all here This was a set up! That&#39;s how Xaxas, who was also *smugly* here could permit me in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the fuck!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods damn it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t be Cool Or A Bum! This is Bullshit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Tenfold were that ten warriors who were serious as the Nile&#39;s current. They were tall enough that our eyes met on even ground. Each threw down their weapons, and we silently agreed that this would be a fist fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay that way wolf. I don&#39;t want to kill you the first punch.&#34; Said the leader. His gold armor was the most ornate, with Aris&#39;s crest on his chest plate, a sword and shield. I think that design was a little different, as Aris&#39;s wings were still growing back..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lost them in his battle with Xaxas. He literally ripped them off. I still don&#39;t see how they reconciled, but I wouldn&#39;t say that and start shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[I doubt it.] I scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want this kill. I am the first to ever be here. I am the last you will ever see. I am Rezair: the Relentless One, first son of Aris. Behind me are my full brothers. Should I defeat you, I will be the new Demigod of Chaos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took off his helmet, and I was going to fight a mini-Aris ok.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah take off your armor I think a good old fashioned fist fight will be interesting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We are now both naked. Now this was like the Olympia games of old, in a place that looked like the mirror image of it.only bigger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you can use your bow, and I, my sword.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;Your sons should wed my daughters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They have mates unfortunately.&#34; I said seriously. We circled, and it was he who came first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for my lightning, I&#39;d have been hit. I burned him with it but he laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marvelous. Someone as fast as me.&#34; He damn near teleported, and our knuckles smashed together. We both broke our hands and healed. He too was a lefty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He excitedly swung at me, and I got him in the liver. He coughed blood, and summoned his sword, and I my bow. We clashed at speeds I&#39;d only attained in Hell. He was so fast that I&#39;m sure Willow would only see flashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Willow----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gloria left a little after two, though Sentinel was still working on other projects. He delt with the humans, and made sure everything was right. He was ordering their supplies, and I finally asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think of Gloria?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The mortal&#39;s cute but she&#39;s taken.&#34; He said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, she isn&#39;t. Her Alpha took advantage of her. Well he strung her along, and denied her baby until Kaizen stepped in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds about what a dog does.&#34; He said with pursed lips. &#34;However, she does not belong to the Master. Our children would be half human I doubt she&#39;d want that.&#34; He mumbled. &#34;Half angels make hybrids of the other half of them. If I were half, I don&#39;t know goblin for example, the child would be a wolf-goblin hybrid. That&#39;s not fair to her.&#34; He said with a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the half angel that runs this town with my mate. I&#39;m sure she&#39;d love your courting. With wolves, they value rank.&#34; I tried to word it the way he&#39;d say it, since he was so old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s going to birth soon Willow. It&#39;d be a fool to say anything to her. I heard her while she wove that blanketShe&#39;s so unsure, and they haze her relentlessly, even the Omegas shun her She hates it here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I saw how she blushed at you.&#34; I said putting a hand on his shoulder. He always feels like safety. The warmth from him was passive, and I know she&#39;d trust him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s just because she thinks I&#39;m cute. I get that a lot. No one in their right mind would willingly want me. I need to pick up the humans&#39; supplies for the week with the unicorns. I protect them since so many goblins live here.&#34; He said firmly. With a snap of his fingers, he was in his armor, but I don&#39;t understand why he did that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so shiny There must be an illusion over it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then have a safe trip. I&#39;ll talk to her for you, and if it goes well I&#39;ll text you.&#34; I said with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let her know that if she wishes to stay in my mansion, I have 9 empty rooms at the corner of Scott and Froster. I&#39;ll text it to you.&#34; He said flustered. &#34;What would I even *say* to a woman?&#34; He mumbled out loud leaving before I could answer him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head For all these people to be so &#39;old and scary&#39; the fact that he&#39;s probably a multi-thousand year old virgin afraid to talk to girls it was a little funny That wasn&#39;t a bad thing or anything, just not something I expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mistress.&#34; Hissed someone like a snake in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried my best not to show fear about it. But I did jump. I gained a cheeky chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; He hissed. &#34;Souswaz does not hold a mortal form often, but Souswaz comes with a message from the masters.&#34; He said as I turned around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was *definitely a demon*. He had 6 arms, being bright red skinned. His horns were only little nubs, but he was long. His torso was too long. It made him probably taller than Kaizen. His face was kind of reptilian, and his eyes were a vivid green. &#34;Souswaz is only a messenger&#34; he bowed, hissing every &#39;s&#39; sound, even the &#39;z&#39; a bit at the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the message?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The highest master wishes you attend. He invites you to an even most honorable birther of generalswed to the First Souswaz can take you.&#34; He bowed so low his forehead nearly touched the table, but he was so long that he bended like a noodle</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I&#39;m good.&#34; I said seeing his smile go away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you not trust Souswaz?&#34; He asked bowing lower. Now it was on the table. He looked like he was ashamed. &#34;It is the little horns, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly no. I was told hissing is rude.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Souswaz knows he does not look like the high demons Souswaz cannot sound like them Souswaz tongue is thin, and split, because of the cicada-spider-snake Sauswaz is.&#34; He hissed, showing me his black snake tongue. &#34;They flaunt their beautiful bodies and perfect forms This is the best one so low can do most honorable one.&#34; He said that as if he were jealous. &#34;They make light of my many legs. They step on small Souswaz if he is too slow to move out the way but Souswaz is fast.&#34; He said proudly. &#34;Fast enough to zip here and bring the little master his wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I internally facepalmed. I felt sorry for a bug. Well... a demon bug  &#34;Vow in blood no tricks.&#34;  He cut his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Souswaz vows his loyalty to the wife of the little master. Most terrifying, honorable blood.&#34; He said this not looking me in the eyes, but rather my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flinched when I petted his bald head. I wanted to cut him off. I wanted to tell him that he didn&#39;t have to grovel at me, or that I&#39;d hurt him, but I doubt he&#39;d either understand or accept that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was awful I did NOT like being treated like royalty I took his hand, and I was in a large arena booth It was at least double the size of the one in Hell... The man with a cane looked like the God of War, Arviel&#39;s oldest son from Lia.  But..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why were the boys here with their grandparents.. Why was Arviel here too. I thought- You know what, I can&#39;t keep up with what they&#39;re doing I&#39;ll just roll with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome to Valhallya little fox. Good job tiny demon.&#34; Aris tossed Souswaz a gold coin. He bowed repeatedly and left. I was given a seat between the Horned One on my right and Aris on my left Kaizen&#39;s parents were here too, along with the other princes of hell</p>
