                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a great gasp, the man with white hair woke. He made sounds I didn&#39;t understand, but somehow. I knew it was a language.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Del deeya eh hean, ehf-hen heh&#34; he said through a strange jumble of sounds and mouthing his words overdramatically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh. Doogle Translate might help.&#34; Said Kaizen. He looked firmly at the computer we shared, and I can&#39;t lie I got nosy. I didn&#39;t know there was a translation app for the supernatural languages too, but it seemed to confirm that it was a supernatural internet service provider first. I could only guess that if you weren&#39;t, you&#39;d never see this additional feature</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They worked Really hard to make sure humans stayed ignorant to this world</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He texted Gilbert to find the oldest half beast he could, and typed in &#39;You&#39;re safe, wait a moment for a translator.&#39; In the computer I couldn&#39;t make heads or tails on how it was supposed to be said, seeing as how the language looked like Greek, but I doubted that it would sound like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, .Neh-yah, ek eeban Eppi naya tol- lev viphios...&#34; Kaizen said like he was questioning if he said it right. He spoke with growls, though the man nodded, sitting cross legged in Kaizen&#39;s sweats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remained seated while we got the last person sorted It was now 4:30. Kaizen wasn&#39;t done. We&#39;d have to do more of this tomorrow, but we were pretty productive. I lived in a small town of 20,000, but for supernatural people, packs this size was more common.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Really, an Alpha ran only a few families, as there were only a few peoples out there in number. In total, there were 952 residents according to the census, and adding who we brought to the number along with those who came to join the pack even when it was unofficial. Kaizen&#39;s name and reputation was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Elder Asmondi, son of the bull demon Lord Essel, and the mortal Tytifahn.&#34; Bowed the pale, Arab man coming in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The translator came, looking shocked, bowing on bended knee, muttering something to the white-haired man. He was probably as wide as an 18-wheeler, and just as tall. Well compared to me. The black haired, pale man&#39;s height was probably shorter than Kaizen&#39;s shrank form but not by much Being short meant that even some of the kids were bigger than me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well that *really* confirms it.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;What&#39;s his name Asmondi?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a small conversation, and the minotaur grunted, standing. &#34;He has no name it seems we are able to be awakened by your blood my lord.&#34; Bowed the elder. He held the stern, scarred look of a seasoned warrior. And old, dented cuts around his neck, despite his youthful face. Those weren&#39;t wrinkles; those were scars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then if you know of any more bring them to me. We will no longer cull them. They shouldn&#39;t have to be put down like cattle if I can provide a solution.&#34; Said my mate firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you do this for my son?&#34; Elder Asmondi asked. &#34;He he&#39;s in the basement below the dungeon My son Domitri is harmless, though he is a third generation. I had not the heart to slay my own kin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will. It also seems.&#34; He paused as if he didn&#39;t want to say it. &#34;It seems I am here for a reason indeed My brother protects the shifters my sister rules the dragons. And I am to take in the outcast the useful, yet abandoned, mindless, misguided, and sinner are to be claimed by me.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words held an unseen weight in the silence after Asmondi translated to the white bull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could understand his hesitation to be anyone&#39;s saving grace, since he was only saving them from death on Urth. His blood marked them for Tarteron.  So it was likely a very good thing that he was conservative on using it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This place stinks of barn, demon, and dog.&#34; Said a woman who was downstairs, completely offended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch your fucking mouth Ami!&#34; growled Kaizen. &#34;That&#39;s the Fae Queen Diana&#39;s daughter. Her real name&#39;s I think Amili&#39;lila-anmiya or something, so they generally dumb down their names to be easier to remember&#34; He said to me, pulling me closer to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is it?! Who Dares Besmirch my mother&#39;s name!&#34; Princess Ami screamed at the top of her lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nobody summoned *You*, you dumb bitch.&#34; Snarled Kaizen, standing up. &#34;If you come up here with your bullshit.&#34; He warned. His eyes changed from the regular whites of his eyes to black, along with his composure, and small size. The bull looked nervous, so for peace, he didn&#39;t finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t hear any steps, as when she came through the door, she was still floating. She had butterfly wings, having glittering purple hair and reddish, yet pale skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck are you talking about Princess Ami?&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I *knew* an *animal* was behind this!&#34; She yelled. &#34;My mother would *Never*.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ami you better not be up there making problems! I only let you come because you swore you&#39;d behave!&#34; Screamed a man who did stomp up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was massive, and with a full kneel, the elder Asmondi made way for who had to be the king of minotaur. He had on aviator shades, and when he took them off, his brown eyes were actually a reddish brown. He snorted, being identical to the white haired man. A smaller, curly blonde man was with him. That had to be his mate, Noah I think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Mother would Not Have something by by You!&#34; She screamed. &#34;She would have been more responsible than to birth something like that!&#34; She pointed at the Kings son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His growl sounded deeper than a wolf&#39;s.. maybe an octave lower than Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Little girl, it would be wise to move.&#34; He said with a glare that could slice meat. She did as she was told, and I could smell his anger it reminded me of nothing I&#39;d ever experienced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said something to the man in his language, and it was responded to. &#34;Is his mother Diana?&#34; Asked Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. I&#39;d been with other people when we broke up but he carries her scent. Had Ami had a nose like us, she&#39;d notice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fell to her knees, shedding tears and screaming. &#34;My mother would not have *something* like this! I won&#39;t stand for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then go stand out-fucking-side. Diana will be here in about 3 minutes.&#34; He snarled. &#34;I can&#39;t believe it myself My people are usually drowned at birth, smashed by rocks chained up in dungeons because their parents don&#39;t have the will to set the mindless free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As they should be! Your people were meant to be bastard warnings, a myth made true for those who lust after the barn! My mother made you a pet because she missed father, and became attached to the first thing she saw!&#34; Ami yelled, and he closed his eyes. With a steam filled snort, he pinched the bridge of his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the while. Asmondi translated</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if that is so, it is not your place to say such things.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;You say that to stab a dagger in my uncle&#39;s heart how Ugly you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did I let you ride with us.&#34; Said Noah. The King stopped his mate from holding his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t touch me Noah I might need to go outside.&#34; He said holding his hand up to stop his mate. His hands were clawed. &#34;I I don&#39;t want to hurt you on accident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve seen enough. Get out.&#34; I said standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And who do you-&#34; She was stopped by my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go!&#34; Pointed Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Animals.&#34; She growled, showing her true colors for all to see I didn&#39;t even know her I knew the term &#39;bitch&#39; was a higher swear than any other to the wolves, and she deserved it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her photocopy slowly stepped up right after her, and as they passed each other I could hear them talk in their language, and her daughter started crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me see him.&#34; Said who had to be Queen Diana. She looked like the epitome of grace and perfection, wearing a yellow sundress that reflected yellow on her clear, iridescent wings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a piece of work.&#34; Said Noah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What can I say?&#34; She said angrily. &#34;I was left alone by your husband, running a kingdom of fae who would have smothered him in his crib thinking they were doing me a favor!&#34; She yelled. &#34;I brought him all the way to this continent, still recovering from birthing, a-fucking-SHAMED of what came out of me!&#34; She yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slapped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sinister sneer didn&#39;t make me back down. &#34;I don&#39;t even know them I don&#39;t know anything about you, but I know a LIAR when I see one! You sound like your daughter. Are you so high and mighty that you couldn&#39;t love your own son? How can you stand there and call him *it* and *thing* so casually in front of his face?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Had he been born in flesh, I would have kept him.&#34; She said coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even now you sound like you&#39;re talking about your nails getting done!&#34; Noah screamed back he pointed his human finger in her face, while the Minotaur King stood there, glaring at his son. I couldn&#39;t make out what he was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I WAS ALONE!&#34; She Screamed. &#34;You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like! The Sneers, the Looks, the Talk while my belly was full.. Diana, Queen of Fucking Beasts of the Field! What we had was meant to be a gods damn fling but I did love my child!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t tell!&#34; said Noah pulling his hair. &#34;You were with Jerold during the Fucking WAR! He can&#39;t even speak.&#34; He pointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can I just don&#39;t have any words.&#34; He said with an anger that filled the room with its venom. He said this calmly. &#34;He had no mind Diana. I would have kept my son regardless of his condition. But this is Better. We were meant to be a punishment by the god of Mercy. If you didn&#39;t want your womb&#39;s curse to breathe, you should not have enjoyed me so much.&#34; He said turning from her. He didn&#39;t even want to look at her I don&#39;t understand what he said to his son, but he said something back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t even have a name.&#34; Hissed Noah. &#34;You name even your gods damn plants. You did what you wanted with my mate, and used him like a sex toy Throwing away the consequences of your fun. Why did you even come here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to see but now I&#39;ve seen. I ask that you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may ask for Nothing.&#34; Said Jerold. &#34;You had everything you ever wanted, yet our child suffered in the cold and in fields living as the animal you see us as eating fucking grass. Go be with your fae children. Pray you never need them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t want this. You have to believe I did it out of concern for him.&#34; She mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Had you been concerned, you&#39;d have put him in an orphanage, the one ran by my mother for the calm ones.... Even if he wasn&#39;t, at the age of a newborn she could have Easily tamed him. You&#39;d have given him to me, or Ash, or Hadeon. I know he&#39;d have Loved my son in his collection, and Wix is the same. You did what you wanted, forgetting him, thinking he died by the wild animals a long time ago. He smells like Forest Guardian My son was fucking raised and protected by spirits! You threw him a continent away like his life was Garbage!&#34; He snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a pound of his fist, the wall connected to the bedroom held a whole about 8 feet around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took two steps his direction to try and soothe him, but the boom of his voice made me and Kaizen step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t fucking touch me Fae.&#34; He snarled. &#34;It&#39;s taking everything I have not to shift in this room. Go home. You saw what you wanted to see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did&#34; She said pulling a stone out her pocket. She kissed it and disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was silent a long time The only thing to be heard was the ticking of the clock on the floor under the rubble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry uncle.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked to Kaizen, and hugged him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not apologize.&#34; He said pulling away, and his stern face He looked like he held tears. &#34;My son without you would have eventually been on someone&#39;s wall.&#34; He looked at him, rumbling something in his language. &#34;My son. I always wanted children. I feared it too All my life I tried to be the father for the lost, for they had no one to go home to I was their home. I was their respite, while my blood roamed without a mind How selfish she was. How Stupid I was..&#34; he face palmed. &#34;His name shall be Alavastros, the Prince of Halves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a good name.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has to be.&#34; Said Jerold.</p>
