                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hummed under his warm touch We talked about all those large plans, but the moment we got back to town, we checked back into our room, and both took a nap That nap turned to at Least a 10 hour rest. The moon was out now It was 5 am. I&#39;d see the sunrise tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen snored, and I was hungry downstairs had 24 hour dining</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wondered should I wait. But I was honestly famished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put on some pajamas and went down the elevator the stairs looked creepy. The lighting in the halls, even downstairs was dim. I guess because many of them could see in the dark. But in the dining area they had the make your own waffle machine on, as well as a few pastries out. I got some tea, and sat alone in the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to go back up and wake my mate my husband</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still had no regrets as to Why I did thatwhy I wanted a connection with a damn near stranger. Why I let an agent of the Adversary claim me why I liked it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. Pets must be attended by their masters.&#34; Said an elvish receptionist she was a 6 foot model with purplish pink hair she looked and sounded legitimately angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey back off Alpha&#39;s mate.&#34; Growled a red headed werewolf, one of the trio that wanted to join Kaizen I didn&#39;t know his name or anything, but I was thankful they stepped in so fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Know you see the moon on her neck.&#34; Said another werewolf. His hair was inky black, but the look of his scarred face gave me an off sensation. Like I should get Away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even Notice him behind me, putting a hand on my shoulder until he spoke. And I subconsciously put my hand over the bite. It was Fresh.. I could feel the four fang marks of my husband. Inside that, in the center of it was a moon . What felt like the symbol of the Horned One as the border of this raised tattoo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are no Registered Alphas here.&#34; She said with crossed arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you wake his majesty, you&#39;ll see who&#39;s registered as what Elf.&#34; The black haired werewolf said with crossed arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t mean.&#34; It was Then that she looked worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beat it.&#34; The red haired werewolf growled. He had a plate the size of Texes, filled with only meat. &#34;Mind if I sit with you Luna?&#34; He asked. &#34;Name&#39;s Ace, that&#39;s Jack, and the Blonde-boy is Rick.&#34; He grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook my hand, and they put their plates at the table before I could actually say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for the save.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any wolf with a nose would have Well the dragons and maybe the vampires too now.. earlier you weren&#39;t marked and no one&#39;s risking their life for a Pet. But you&#39;re a Luna.&#34; He said with a hum. He cracked the bone in the middle of his roast meat and put a slab of it on my plate. It took him no effort to do that with just his thumb and a claw</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um thank you?&#34; I said questioningly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get you some wine Luna.&#34; Said the blonde haired one, I think his name was Rick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Earlier Kaizen didn&#39;t want to join your group&#34; I mumbled. &#34;You&#39;re not trying to butter me up?&#34; I said more as a joke, but they took it seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never you&#39;re a mate of the Royal Family your words regardless of his status don&#39;t change.&#34; Said Ace. He had some almost unnaturally green eyes. There was some blonde in his hair too now that I looked a little closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s his status?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Banished. He is currently wanted with a 90 million dollar bounty Alive. You get nothing if he&#39;s dead, and 1 million if he&#39;s injured.&#34; He said as the blonde guy brought beers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry Ace, all they got&#39;s Samson Adeem&#39;s.&#34; Rick complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Human beer is piss water whatever.&#34; Said the black haired werewolf, Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s all of your status?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rogues. Jacks&#39;s kill on sight.&#34; He pointed to him with his thumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m still wanted by the Scotland Yard.&#34; He chuckled. His fanged grin was unsettling Kaizen was basically a literal demon. But Jack&#39;s face ironically looked honestly. sinister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something told me that if I wasn&#39;t claimed by Kaizen that this Jack person would have probably killed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m wanted for fucking Alpha Green of GreenMoon&#39;s mate.&#34; Rick chuckled. &#34;She&#39;s his mark mate not his true. If she was, she wouldn&#39;t have had me in their bed. She isn&#39;t even banished for it&#34; He grumbled. &#34;He just downed her status, and picked another female.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you even Do that?&#34; Asked Ace. &#34;Like I know you told me, but I never thought about it much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see Why she might have been seduced. He was handsome. Unlike Jackson the Slasher over there, he looked like a golden haired elf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t know. Don&#39;t care.&#34; Said Rick. &#34;Tell her your status Ace.&#34; He said cutting into his ham with a knife and fork. It seemed some of them used human ways of eating while Jack tore into his food like a madman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m wanted because I was born out here. Well not Literally, but basically. I never got the Chance to do anything more than be a vagabond. I don&#39;t even have a pack ID, because my mother never got the chance to register me. I left at 15; never looked back. But I am from OilMoon.&#34; He said with a bittersweet smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If he finds a mate, usually an Alpha will pardon someone like him. Not me a royal would have to pardon a serial killer.&#34; Said Jack. He chuckled. &#34;I don&#39;t remember how old I am, just how many I&#39;ve killed at least one a day. Two if I missed one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>See I was Joking Lord of Light! This is what I get for mingling with the Adversary&#39;s children!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; Yawned Kaizen. &#34;I keep getting waves of discomfort.&#34; He said shooting them glares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We told her of our past we still wish to join you, my lord.&#34; Said Ace. They bowed their heads, while Kaizen looked down on them from the top of the stairs It was so condescending, he may as well could have been glaring at worms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No pack will take any of us sir but they may take the children. We protect quite a few pups under the age of 10. 4 in total. The youngest is 3,&#34; Said Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget about their mothers. Valery&#39;s a pregnant Omega.&#34; Added Rick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen sighed. &#34;And what would I do?&#34; He demanded. &#34;Go into a pack as a Rogue myself, and hope I don&#39;t have to kill every Warrior in a pack to be heard?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No but we could be your war band maybe you could settle in a human town. Under the protection of the Secret Police you&#39;re a Royal I KNOW they will make an exception for you and yours.&#34; Said Ace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hummed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They would. But you forget most precincts are ran by unicorns. They&#39;d turn me in with or without any bounty money.&#34; He said as if he&#39;d heard them talking to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least think on it Alpha.&#34; Said Rick, bowing his head lower. They all did when he tisked at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t call me that.&#34; He growled</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen maybe they could just trail behind us?&#34; I offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have a bus.&#34; Said Ace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; My presence will likely be enough. But once we reach a major port city you Scram.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;Why do I even bother.&#34; He said sitting down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat, and elves rushed to give him a roast beef leg and some wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Now you all change your tune?&#34; He said agitated. &#34;I hear Everyone All the time. I know what you all did, scram.&#34; He said shooing the elves away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s some service sir.&#34; Said Ace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah for Me, not the only person I care about. I was Trying to sleep I thought I was dreaming since you went downstairs, but I see I should have come sooner.&#34; He said not touching what they gave him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen at least eat what they gave you.&#34; I said sliding it a little closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;only because you asked. I&#39;m checking out in the morning.&#34; He said making his fork red hot &#34;Damit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can use mine.&#34; I offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah it&#39;s alright.&#34; He put it in his mouth to cool it, then stuck it in his meat Needless to say everyone who saw that was impressed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Lord Kaizen.&#34; Said Ace hesitantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just Kaizen is fine.&#34; He said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assume then that you know our stories.&#34; Asked Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew that yesterday.&#34; Said Kaizen humming as he ate. His food still steamed. &#34;I also know if any of you do anything stupid, I will skin you, and tan your hide myself.&#34; He warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The terrified looks on their faces told me it was possible. And he said it so casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ace as smoothly as he talked choked on his beer when he tried to drink it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen be nice.&#34; I said to kind of diffuse the situation. &#34;Regardless of their past, they&#39;re trying to do good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swore in blood I would not kill again unless it to defend myself or others.&#34; Said Jack. &#34;My ways are not reformed, but I have self control sire.&#34; He said with an English accent. His eyes also changed to red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just a horny wolf who got caught fucking my Alpha&#39;s wife. That&#39;s what he gets for rejecting my Omega sister.&#34; Grumbled Rick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you probably know I was born to be out here I. I threw all contact with my family AWAY. I stole the money we needed to Rest for a minute it&#39;s So Hard every night every night of my life until This Week have I not known what a Real bed feels like flea infested hotels ran by bloodsuckers, roach crawling, rat skittering places in the dark. Hovels of abandoned homes sleeping on the ground shifted because I was too scared to not be Ready even now I still look over my shoulder for some Alpha some Fucking Big Monster to grab me by the scruff and tell me I don&#39;t belong&#34; Said Ace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounded bitter however Kaizen glared at Ace sternly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before all this, All I lived was a life of luxury I Was the Big Monster who&#39;d grab you in the night and shake the pelt Right off you, because your presence angered me My Beta office has two on the floor, and one tacked to the wall The taste of Fresh man&#39;s meat, still screaming the taste of blood in general I dare say sometimes I caught myself wanting to drink it. I am Not a good person. I am Not some holy Alpha on a white fucking winged unicorn sent to save anybody.&#34; He said looking at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what to say They shared their hearts, and I think it was my turn, though no one forced or said anything to make me share. I wanted to though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All my life I was just. I guess a boring human.&#34; I chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But that&#39;s Good.&#34; Said Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was.&#34; I smiled. &#34;I grew up in a small town, around good people I taught at an expensive private school that paid for my tuition I didn&#39;t think you guys existed And once I Did, Everything Changed so FAST, I still wonder if it&#39;s even real&#34; I mumbled. &#34;But Kaizen, you DID SAVE meI was going to be ripped apart by the werewolves you killed You didn&#39;t have to ride a white unicorn you didn&#39;t have to be some righteous knight you sacrificed everything for me&#34; I said quietly. &#34;I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but that&#39;s more than enough for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was going to apologize for it, but he kissed me gently on the top of the head. I could feel his pride. &#34;And I&#39;d do it again I didn&#39;t know I was saving my mate but my instincts did&#34;</p>
