                <p>Herculian</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was I saw how happy the Night side is I see how much comradery they have for each other, and the ties they share because there are so few of them. I have as many brothers and sisters as there are visible stars in my realm I I wished I had that.&#34; I looked down in shame</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d made the very thing that killed my brothers</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#34; This pained me The Shame &#34;They were to be as brothers My son was to pave the way for Hell and Haven to have peace&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You lot&#34; Said the Horned One. His emotionless face made me question how he felt. &#34;The mortal is not divine enough to be a massive threat, but he does carry god&#39;s blood. That&#39;s enough to make him a problem should you fail him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t fail.&#34; I said firmly. &#34;Allow me to raise him. I&#39;ll cull him myself if he lifts a finger to harm your wife.&#34; I bowed for my son&#39;s sake, but father&#39;s wife was now his mate His worry for her superseded the bastard grandson from a bastard son</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to kill the boy before he speaks.&#34; Said father. How could he order such a thing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He isn&#39;t even born yet.&#34; I hissed. I could feel a cold blade on the back of my neck. I knew it was possibly Michael &#34;Forgive my tone.&#34; I said angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you have qualms of tone, I hope you&#39;re ready for mine Kneel Uriel.&#34; Growled War. &#34;He intends to be in his boy&#39;s life. Lesser Contradiction cannot harm mother. Why are you so bent on this?&#34; He hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I know better. The moment he speaks, he will become who he&#39;s meant to be, a destroyer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you aren&#39;t giving him a chance to choose his fate.&#34; Said War. &#34;Was it not you who encourages that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You better not go deliver that creature.&#34; Arviel growled standing, not acknowledging War&#39;s comment. &#34;You saw how badly she suffered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The God of war left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;THAT LITTLE-&#34; He was cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Husband do not speak for me.&#34; Said Lia. &#34;There&#39;s more than enough Champions to deal with him when he&#39;s born. Bless the child.&#34; She said soothingly. Only her words were heard it seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bless him with light. May it outshine the darkness in his heart.&#34; He grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aris is right.&#34; Said The Horned One in agreement with Queen Lia. &#34;Your son came here for guidance and blessings, not ruin to his house. This is why you keep having problems with your blood. Another, albeit quarter god of Contradiction would not have been made if there was nothing to envy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt ashamed for that envy but it&#39;s hard not to covet wanting love. I didn&#39;t *get* to be a child. I got to be an orphan and a slave Kaizen, even as a fugitive, was treated better than I Diana gives me that love in her own selfish way I left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got home, he was in the God of War&#39;s arms, and Diana looked disheveled and exhausted but my half-brother lent her his strength</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My boy was put in my arms &#34;Name him.&#34; She panted. I&#39;d Just missed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hillius. He reminds me of a summer day.&#34; I said being handed my son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did smell of contradiction, though not nearly as strong as a demigod. He was essentially mortal, and had Diana been human, he&#39;d probably have had a human lifespan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Willow-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the pups 5 and a half months now they slept like little champs. They laid on our bed after I fed them, and we all curled up. I was sore. I was so out of shape. I could feel my muscles ache, knowing that I was invited for basic training proper, and my mate signed me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the next 4 months, I&#39;ll be trained in basic combat that&#39;s something I felt like I did need. Every mate of all the other members of the royal family, including Samira had at least Some training I&#39;m doing it so I&#39;m not an easy target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck I&#39;m sick of that. I&#39;m not stupid either though Some of the creatures we deal with will always bee too much to handle, but with something I can at least attempt to defend myself, or get away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was given enough strength that I could keep up with those burly men We ran 15 miles yesterday and practiced shifting, then we mock fought a dummy. Captain Lu said soon he&#39;s going to turn us out in pairs, and I&#39;d get a &#39;battle buddy&#39; tomorrow. They were supposed to be my partner until training&#39;s over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That person would also be my sparring partner. I was nervous about that part I&#39;d never hunted, fought anyone, or really knew What I could do with my powers. To be safe about it, they said that my partner might wind up being someone other than a werewolf, and I was fine with that. They were spending this time to teach it to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also wanted to be the Luna this pack needed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found out that bad Lunas don&#39;t participate in pack affairs, but also being weak and over-depending on the Alpha is just as bad. Nobody expects me to be Xenai Warrior Princess, but nobody needed a leader who wasn&#39;t up to snuff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleep.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;You&#39;re too loud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; I mumbled sheepishly. He held me a little closer, and I rested my head on his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This week was hard with all the new arrivals, and managing the rich snobs who wanted the town to stay high end and exclusive. I knew he&#39;d asked me to quiet down, but we did have to meet with Mr. Porter, a goblin noble tomorrow. Kaizen wanted more land, but the next lot over belonged to him. Mr. Porter didn&#39;t seem keen on commoners living so close to him, and considered moving anyway</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know what they expect. With a pack will come all income, social status, and rank levelsNot everyone is a former CEO, or royal blood who only lives here because there&#39;s a target on their back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slept though. I learned that sleep is precious, and to get it while I can.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was an explosion that followed a blinding flash of light. It was so bright, that I was legitimately blinded a few seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I screamed from the surprise. The pups woke screaming, as they could hear now, and see a bit too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is the meaning of this?!&#34; Growled Eternya. There was another explosion, though this time it was in our bedroom. Shuffling sounds and a baby could be heard upset. They weren&#39;t crying yet, but if this kept up, they would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get off! It&#39;s me! I wanted you all to see!&#34; Beamed someone who lit up our bedroom with their bright light. The regular lights were turn on, and my pups screamed at being startled awake...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s 4 in the *fucking* morning Herculian!&#34; Yelled Kaizen, nearly tossing a pillow if not for the toddler in Herculian&#39;s arms. Their father&#39;s initial hostility made the pups squeak worse in fear &#34;Damnit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got them.&#34; I said shaking my head. It was too startling for any baby. Now I would have to deal with fussy twins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry I wanted you to see Hillius I wanted you to meet him, that you know he exists&#34; He held up the newborn baby boy. Well He wasn&#39;t exactly &#39;newborn&#39;. He looked about 4? &#34;Come hold him.&#34; He encouraged. He put the chocolate little boy in my mate&#39;s arms before he could protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He smells like like the sun.&#34; Kaizen admitted. &#34;Welcome to the world, and receive my blessing. Brother, why do you speak as if this is your son&#39;s last day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It very well may be Father is dissatisfied with him.He is a Lesser Contradiciton&#34; He said as if he were ashamed. &#34;That is *my* fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boy looked almost frustrated, but he gave Kaizen a hug. My mate petted the boy&#39;s white hair. He looked exactly like his father if not for the darker complexion. It was rich, like dark chocolate, and he did smell like light. That was actually interesting I could tell he was marked by the Lord of Light by scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the blessing you had in mind?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen pressed his forehead to his nephew, and his flame appeared between his horns. &#34;This one holds darkness in his heart.&#34; He said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34; Said HerculianHe looked upset, but I could understand it... his child is meant for Arviel&#39;s army. &#34;Father wishes me to slay my son before he can speak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then may ne never utter a word.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;If that is the catalyst to make another problemanother Contradiction may your tongue be tied, little Hillius. May you live this life in the light you&#39;re meant to. But in return I only think it fair I will give him ability to link and communicate with his mind.&#34; He kissed his forehead, and passed him to his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s smart thinking.&#34; Said Herculian. &#34;Thank you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My only issue is that my house has a draft. Go be with your wife. Today is meant to be joyous.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Diana said he should be able to speak in a few hours.&#34; Said Herculian. &#34;I suppose now it will be telepathic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye. His eyes flash red already.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;You will have your &#39;voice&#39; by sunrise, and *you* need to take your son home before Diana loses her mind. I hope she doesn&#39;t think you went to carry out his orders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted you to be the first to see.&#34; Herculian grinned wide</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go with my blessing Hillius.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;May his blades never cross his kin. May they all love each other as littermates.&#34; He passed Hillius back to Herculian</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a good blessing.&#34; Said Herculian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is. Now go home before Diana loses her mind. You literally took a newborn babe states away to show him off.&#34; Said Kaizen. They pressed foreheads together, something I knew only very close people did with each other</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never expected to be treated as a brother.&#34; Said Herculian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You protect the world as much as I do. As far as I&#39;m concerned, you&#39;re an honorary wolf.&#34; Kaizen chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry for the surprise this morning... and sorry I broke your window and alerted your guards.&#34; He vanished by becoming a beam of light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone . Go to bed. We&#39;ll fix it in the morning.&#34; Complained Kaizen.</p>
