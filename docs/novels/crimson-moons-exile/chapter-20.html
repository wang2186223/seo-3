                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We slept until check-out time, which was 11am all of us did. They literally had to beat on the door this morning before we left. We were tired and I think it was the first time any of them had a day of being truly free. For me, that didn&#39;t hold as much weight, but seeing everyone&#39;s faces when they ran inside the large, brick home with smiles so wide it made me almost tear up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen had unlocked the doors to the enormous brick mansion  It was three stories, and Wix&#39;s personal former second home. I can only imagine he gave such an extravagant home away on a whim with the motive of having Kaizen be a deterrent for anyone else who wanted to muscle in on such profitable business</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all I got married in all of 3 minutes, we gambled, the kids rode rides and all of us slept in a supernaturally safe area Goblins could get things Done</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the house the white walls with gold crown molding was in every room Every entrance had custom plaster pillars that went to the ceiling. All the furniture was a light beige, so light in fact, I thought it was off white. The accented floors were solid wood, and dark oak, but the carpet was a warm, lighter shade of oak. The light blue and tan rug also looked hand woven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me wonder how much money he invested in this place only to Give it to Kaizen.. and doubled his earnings in the casino Kaizen could live a long, happy life like this. No WE could it felt nice I was married like I wanted I had a husband but more importantly a soulmate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, there&#39;s a basement down here as big as the house!&#34; Yelled Ace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked through the enormous open concept kitchen, dining area and living room The backyard could be seen through glass French doors, but to the right side against the wall was a door that led downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The basement really was about the size of the entire house, and it seemed they put a bunch of extra long twin beds down there for anyone who wouldn&#39;t have a room. There was also a nice seating area down there, and an 80 inch TV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss I literally had a dream to follow you.&#34; Said Ace. &#34;But I still feel like a Rogue&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are, but we&#39;re also a pack.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;With my might I will protect this place I never wanted to be Alpha I never wanted responsibility but now that I have it, and a Luna, it wouldn&#39;t be Right to forsake you all too.&#34; He said looking at his clawed hands. &#34;I cannot undo what I did but maybe this can count for something&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I saw they packed the freezer with meat let&#39;s have a fucking party.&#34; Said Ace with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See I just want to relax. But that does sound nice.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to go to the store, and I could get some drinks.&#34; Said one of the female werewolves she was almost as tall as Ace, and twice as pale. But to be honest, all supernaturals except the goblins and gnomes were all Much taller and bulkier than humans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be fair I kind of want to tag along too.&#34; I said with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This place is gated. Go ahead.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked relaxed like this was the first time in a long time that he let his guard down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It IS the first time I&#39;ve had a chance to fucking Relax&#34; He said letting out his horns. We went into the front of the house while Ace started the grill. &#34;Go with Valery.&#34; He encouraged kissing me on the lips slowly there was so much passion in it he held me like I&#39;d collapse from his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was melting butter until he gently released me And I went with Valery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gated community was filled with enormous houses, and above flew dragons and witches while below ran wolves, unicorns, and cat people.  I could only guess that this was where the Filthy rich creatures lived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Especially since I was the only human here. And I got looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most were of curiosity since they saw the mark on my neck, but some were malicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see your frown Luna, pay them no mind.&#34; Said Valery. She was as pale as me, though her blonde hair shined almost as if it were made of glitter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t.&#34; I smiled. &#34;I&#39;m kind of used to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not good. No one should single you out because of your blood&#34; She mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that why you&#39;re a Rogue?&#39; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well..I just got Tired of being treated like Shit especially after my mate passed I hate that I&#39;m putting my boys and daughter through this but Lord Kaizen doesn&#39;t see rank it&#39;s refreshing.&#34; She smiled. &#34;In my old pack they thought might made right I&#39;ll be 834 this year. I was Sick of it. I know as an Omega, mated to an Omega we were barely seen as wolves, but it got to the point to where I was becoming the pack punching bag&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Were you alive during the witch trials? Sorry if that question is so odd just that Kaizen&#39;s a hundred, you&#39;re over 800 like I&#39;m just 27.&#34; She didn&#39;t look a day over 30.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She giggled. &#34;Yes, but as an Omega, I got a chance to travel with my husband to get supplies for the pack. I&#39;m so weak of a wolf that I&#39;m not even allergic to silver, but my children are gifted with the shift, as this condition is random.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How I see it, is that we&#39;re all in this together.&#34; I said with a small smile. &#34;I also feel like all of us should be able to RelaxEspecially anyone who isn&#39;t strong my husband would never treat anyone like that.&#34; I said confidently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their world was much more brutal My people may have done many terrible things, especially to each other. But no one out right made it so you couldn&#39;t live your life Just because of your condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know I see so many peoples an no one seems too bad.&#34; She bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no, you don&#39;t have to do that.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, not only are you mated to a prince, but our Alpha. Please do not interrupt this custim. I am only an Omega but should others do as they should, the respect they give will make your life much easier.&#34; She said rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Others saw this and surely enough, other shifters bowed as we passed. It seemed like word spread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also sounded a little more encouraged. But I don&#39;t think I could ever understand her feelings. To be cast out of society for power. That didn&#39;t happen with humans at least, not outright. Sure the homeless and poor had it hard, but no one treated you like shit because you were human or in her case, as strong as one from what I&#39;ve been told.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the supermarket stopped my train of thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the store everything was so expensive here but my mate gave me access to his funds. So I didn&#39;t mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We bought the $50 a case elvish beer 4 in total, bread and snacks too. We spent more money than if we&#39;d have just gone to Tiger Market, the local grocery store in the human part of town but then we&#39;d have to drive and we wouldn&#39;t be protected or anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unicorn cashier had their horn out for everyone to see, and we left with the heavy bags. We didn&#39;t think to ask one of the boys to come with us, but even so, another wolf approached us and shifted into a human shape it was a naked man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Need any help?&#34; He asked. &#34;Name&#39;s Yuka, like the plant.&#34; He smirked. He took our stuff before we could ask for help, but his smile was infectious. There was no malice or ulterior motive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was tall, gray saggy haired and tan, but he seemed nice enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Willow and that&#39;s Valery. Thank you so much.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well. It would be Rude to allow an Omega and a Human to carry so much beer and food. Welcome to MisfitMoon.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;That isn&#39;t it&#39;s Real name mind you, but the wolves here think it&#39;s fitting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know there was a pack here.&#34; Mumbled Valery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Technically there isn&#39;t, but that&#39;s what all of us call it. Everyone here is an outcast, well a Wealthy outcast of their people anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;d you become a Rogue?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t like pack life. I Could leave, since my former Alpha and me were on good terms... but why be ruled over, when I can just live my life?&#34; He asked. &#34;I was a well off investor in GrayMoon. I wasn&#39;t on the board of directors for the hospitals there or anything, but I Did make good money. I left before Alpha Gray, the Fifth Seat, became a council member, but after the stocks crashed. I left when stocks tanked like they did, and sold um when they bounced back. I feel like an idiot though.... if I&#39;d have waited until now, they&#39;re worth triple what I sold &#39;um for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does the Alpha here trade in stocks too?&#39; I asked. To my understanding, Alphas were like the tribal chiefs of werewolves. They ruled a territory. Wolves would pay taxes to that wolf, but in return he had to risk his life for threats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There was no Alpha until Lord Kaizen arrived. Someone like him here will rule it all soon enough.&#34; He said looking at the direction of the house. &#34;I assume about now, pretty much everyone is going to vow their loyalty to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, though the only person you&#39;d probably have an issue with is Flora, the local nosy neighbor. Just keep your grass cut and no lawn ornaments that phoenix babies her lawn like her actual pups.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Doubt she would do something so dumb seeing as how Kaizen is the grandson of the Horned One.&#34; Said Valery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that True though?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve seen his horns myself there&#39;s even a little candle flicker between them when he yells.&#34; Valery admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t notice that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He hears thoughts and intentions too, so if you&#39;re trying to do something. Don&#39;t.&#34; She mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The only thing I want is some of that grilled meat. It smells like roast venison. I helped move in the furniture; the decorating was my idea.&#34; He said proudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have taste.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; He said walking a little faster than us now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see why We got back to the yard, and sure enough, the woman Yuka warned us about was out there, asking about something. I needed to get closer so I could hear what they were saying, but Yuka laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See I Told you! Flora beat it, you flaming buzzard!&#34; He shouted waving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why I Never! First Dirty Wolves Ruin my garden, now they move a Demon next to me!&#34; She cried dramatically holding the back of her hand to her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a woman with orange red hair, and if not for her being in gardening clothes, she looked human.. You wouldn&#39;t suspect her to be so proper sounding either. If not for the outfit, you&#39;d swear she was some kind of noble. Her accent sounded like she was from the Kingdoms United, but what part I couldn&#39;t say it was definitely a royal accent though.</p>
