                <p>chapter set. This is the third try?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finished up patrol when my mate linked me, and I&#39;m glad I&#39;m home Fuck this was good. I was on my fourth plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m stuffed. Complements to the chef.&#34; I said leaning back I Was stuffed. Stuffed stupid. The pups were too. They were Round.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome.&#34; Smiled Willow. She yawned, while Flora&#39;s kids helped with the dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was glad I could get home as Soon as I finished patrol too Tonight was Chelsea and Flora&#39;s turn. Willow helps as well, but the boys were a handful while I was gone. She was kind of spent I could see it as much as she told me, trying to play off how much work twins of any size can be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They chew Everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even each other. They got into their first &#39;fight&#39; over their favorite rabbit toy today while I was out, but thankfully they&#39;re too little to hurt each other. I got Vex a red one, and Ari an orange one, but they both want the orange one. So I ordered another orange one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And watch. By the time it gets here, they&#39;ll be over it, and argue about the red one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the only thing that had them distracted now was begging for mommy&#39;s plate. Too bad. It&#39;s being collected soon. &#34;Vex it&#39;s time for bathtime.&#34; Said Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.ok&#34; He complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scroll appeared on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas  He summoned all willing Generals, though any who participate will receive a child as a gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wants hell to double but I wasn&#39;t sure about attending. This sounds like if we went, I&#39;d get her pregnant I don&#39;t mind more kids, but if we do, it&#39;ll be her choice. Birthing is rough on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That runs in the Night Court side of my family.. Dying is very possible. So&#39;s outright hard pregnancies, or needing intervention. But seeing my sons I wouldn&#39;t mind daughters too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that Why do you look so stern?&#34; Asked Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Master, is there a problem with the bacon wrapped biscuits I made?&#34; Asked Chelsea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck no. It&#39;s this.&#34; I motioned the scroll. &#34;. Xaxas has made his children, now he must breed his queen it says. &#39;All generals, living or dead, are invited to the creation ritual of the First Prince of Hell. The festival will last 7, 24 hour planetary rotations around a sun&#39;.IT&#39;S AN OUT-RIGHT FUCK FEST FOR REAL?! OH I WANNA GO!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Me and Willow skimmed our scroll, while Eternya read his with Elinore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It says here that unlimited stamina and libido is just in the air. There&#39;s no limit to the amount of pleasure you can feel There&#39;s no limit to how many times you can reach climax</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..mortals, and demigods alike will get to enjoy sex the way it is on the Layer of Sex That much pleasure can actually kill a normal mortal However the air itself is regenerative.  There will be vendors, rides borrowed from Layer One&#39;s amusement park</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All mortals who pair, and marry will be mate bonded, a gift from the Goddess, since she celebrates her god grandchildren I know that&#39;s something the entire pantheon has been anticipating a while now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait if they&#39;re mate bonded All who attend will not only double the army, but have a partner, a Real partner</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It means we could have sex as much as we want without getting tired, or needing a break just all pleasure for 7 days straight All mate bonds are fortified an additional 50% too so her touch will feel *amazing*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure if you go, you&#39;ll end up getting your mate pregnant.&#34; Said Eternya. He looked to be thinking himself He said that sternly, as for him pups are a touchy subject</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that got to do with us?&#34; Said Willow a little sternly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not a general in his division, But, we&#39;ve been invited to a mass fertility ritual. Everyone who goes is going to have the time of their fucking life. Raw, unfiltered gods&#39; magic has saturated all hell&#34; I said impressed he&#39;d do all this like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell is divided in sections. Each prince has their own portion of the realm. He&#39;s probably *tanking* his magic supply for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And additional scroll appeared in Eternya&#39;s hand but that one was white, holding grandmother&#39;s crest. He didn&#39;t read it out loud I wonder if it is a formal summons?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;d make sense. He&#39;s Xaxas&#39;s general. Even if it&#39;s just to drink or congratulate, Xaxas would want him there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you can count me Right out.&#34; She rolled her eyes. &#34;I don&#39;t want more pups.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We already have Two!&#34; She giggled, holding the boys, giving them a bite of the roast duck. Those little teeth are for nomming now. Their appetites reminded me of what dad said They&#39;re about to get their growth spirt. Sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s like five more?&#34; I asked honestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?! I&#39;m a wolf baby. Having more pups is *never* a bad thing.&#34; I said putting a hand on hers. &#34;I hold enough territory and sway that if we even wanted to live off world, we could We have enough room, money, and pack for more pups.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We really do. Everyone thinks they&#39;re adorable Even the Earth Goddess sneaks down here to watch them get into shenanigans outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that but&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rested her head on my chest. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean to offend.&#34; I mumbled. She didn&#39;t want to go through it again She felt overwhelmed with just the twins too, which I didn&#39;t know</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should have left well enough alone. ShitI get it though. Difficult births run firmly within the Night Court With life usually comes a lot of blood and pain for our females, and I would never want to make her feel like she has to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go put the pups to bed.&#34; She said leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood there stupidly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.Did I fuck up?&#34; I asked, looking at my claws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would she not want to add to the fold?&#34; Asked Elinore. She&#39;s a witch. Each Coven is like its own culture, and with hers, male witches held the power, and women make pups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An oversimplification. But still true. She won&#39;t get it. I don&#39;t think any supernatural will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; Said Eternya. &#34;I think it&#39;s more that she&#39;s formally mortal. Some of their cultures don&#39;t really like having a bunch of kids, but I get that too. After. After Allivaldi, at first I didn&#39;t want chicks, but I have the right person. I&#39;m the right person now too.&#34; He said looking at the floor, then he kneeled on bended knee to his wife. &#34;I cannot blame my children for treachery, when their father was never there to Be a father. But I am a general of master Xaxas. I have been summoned. If my lady is willing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you asking me if I wish to go below my lord?&#34; She asked shyly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could not imagine a world where I withhold your happiness. What better way to have a chick, than for them to be blessed by all four masters tonight.&#34; He smiled softly. He burned the scroll in his grip, and a circle appeared under his feet. We both heard her, but words hold power. He wanted her to say it...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked down, feeling a little put on the spot because everyone was nosy. But I get it Eternya, despite his behavior, is one of the Night&#39;s greatest champions And she, the daughter of Apolis&#39;s former High Priest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you have this dance with the Flaming One?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held out his ash covered hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.I would.&#34; She smiled softly. &#34;On the condition that *you* name our babes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They vanished, and I gave my mate enough time to collect herself...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fucked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart sank with every step, because I could feel her own insecurities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; She mumbled. She sniffled, and I rushed to her side. When did she learn to hide her feelings? I couldn&#39;t read her When did she learn to block me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was proud as I was worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? No don&#39;t be upset over this.&#34; I hugged her. The little ones were pretty much out, being so full, and warm from the bath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know you felt like that.&#34; She mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do I do because I love you.&#34; I said hugging her. I kissed her on top of the head. &#34;You feel fucking exhausted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Easy or not, she did put them both to bed. She bathed them this morning too, I took them with me while I flew around a few hours, but that&#39;s the only time she&#39;s had to herself today</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;s the one weening them teaching them to be gentle telling them bedtime stories and such What have I been doing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yesterday they got into Everything too. I thought I was helping enough I thought. I thought she was happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt selfish because in a way it kind of is. Just a tastethe taste of citrus pith. Disgusting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you too Gods I feel like I disappointed you. You looked so excited.&#34; She admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not excited if you&#39;re not up to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is enough. I&#39;ve gotten more than I ever wished for. I got you, the boys, the pack family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That part hurt for her too. She thought of her mother Willow&#39;s mother was blessed with another girl a few months ago Her little sister still drinks milk, but she&#39;ll never meet her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck... I got to do something about all this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got the boys tonight, and tomorrow.&#34; I said getting her to reluctantly lay down. She was tired, but more overwhelmed than anything</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We have a daycare here</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snored. I&#39;ll leave well enough alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*SCREEEEEECH*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was from the forest. Whatever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*BEEP BEEP BEEP*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s My Fucking Car! Damn it I forgot to bring it back!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I teleported into the air above the house, zipping across the sky, thankful that the car alarm used to go off *So* much when I first got it. I was *sure.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And sure enough as I was lightning, I heard the Rogues scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This was stupid!&#34; yelled one, while the driver lost control. That one sounded REALLY young.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They better be glad I see this in slow motion. I debated on saving the little fuckers, but they shouldn&#39;t die because my mood&#39;s all sour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s too Fast!&#34; He yelled. The driver sounded like a teen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Double Shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m going to have to see my car blow up. I can&#39;t save them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come Here!&#34; I Snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is Bullshit! I teleported inside and grabbed them both by the scruff before I watched my baby explode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They watched it burn with growing fear since my anger grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes glowed so red, it became the only color I could see I had to take a breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I counted to ten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir?&#34; Asked the littlest one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\[Don&#39;t move.\] I said in High Demonic. &#34;Don&#39;t run. I will chase you if you do.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes and I could see grandfather&#39;s throne room. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been this mad.</p>
