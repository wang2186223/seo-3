                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Green took back control, but not the form. It just hurt too much to hold the shape. \[I&#39;d be fucking *happy* not chasing tail and having bastards. Not Smelling My Mark Mate with Her True StillBut Reeta&#39;s gone I heard her bastard brother made it to Misfit, so that&#39;s where she&#39;s headed as well. She&#39;s not dead but she left too\]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you Tried having your cake and eating it to.&#34; Said Tyson. &#34;You&#39;re pissed she left, but if you wanted your mate, you should have Had Your Mate. Now you must suffer your eternity without. Make do with what you have, and stop making fucking Tears!&#34; Said Tyson coldly. &#34;And you.&#34; He pointed a clawed finger at Tyna, summoning her to be in front of him with magic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.Ok that was Cool! I need to do that. &#34;You&#39;re Just as Wrong! At no point were you ever faithful because you mated the position, not the man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He howled on the floor like a damn husky. But fuck I felt bad for him. After that Green composed himself and shifted, embarrassed and ashamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.You have my blood word your highness My the bond&#39;s cut I don&#39;t ever want another woman ever again, unless Reeta somehow takes me back.&#34; He bowed, that last part was his wolf. &#34;I can never have my mate ever again and as much as my wolf howls. We are mateless for all time I&#39;ve been Cursed.&#34; He looked at his hands. &#34;My goddess no longer looks my direction I swear the room feels colder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, I could see his soul the Moon on his heart had a little black X. He will forever be mateless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My word is also in blood because I know if I don&#39;t, you&#39;ll behead me.&#34; Mumbled his mark mate. &#34;I vow to only have my mate an none else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I resisted the urge to curse her. I didn&#39;t think it fair she gets her mate after she wrecked this whole pack for power she was never supposed to have, yet, it is poeticAfter all, he invited her into his bed, knowing she didn&#39;t belong there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Behead?&#34; Scoffed Tyson. &#34;You gave me your *blood* word. If you break your oath, your soul is mine.&#34; He hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yeah, you eat souls.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I try to stick to sinners and assholes though.&#34; And I knew Tyson He *makes* Solar Light Energy because he is a truly noble man It tears at him to do that, but he must need it to live. He&#39;s not the kind of person to do it for power&#39;s sake alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They vow, but I don&#39;t think they Really understand. Tyson is a Demigod. To break an oath with him, it means he&#39;ll know it pretty instantly. He&#39;ll kill them both. They aren&#39;t sinners or anything though, so he&#39;ll likely stop there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beta Oki&#39;ka, go put him on the fucking post. You wanna mistreat Omegas, *I* wanna mistreat you.&#34; Snarled Tyson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. I need to go home. And find Reeta. She&#39;s an Omega I believe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, come back and have a beer or something with me later.&#34; He complained. &#34;All I&#39;ve done all day is crack skulls and reap Atlanta-7.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yeah the Chuthuloo planet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We shouldn&#39;t talk about our job while on the job, but whatever. I say let &#39;um hear how absolutely fucked they are if they break that oath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was in the Hell York Times this morning. The cult there summoned him, and he consumed that world. It was destroyed before the cult could infect Atlanta-6, the last planet with life in that solar system.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I thought all the Atlanta planets belonged to Arviel? I could see him asking such a favor though. Atlantis planets are usually advanced to no end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have an extra free pass to Sunland on Aearth if you wanna go.&#34; Bribed Tyson. &#34;Pups under 5 get in free.&#34; He sang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bet it&#39;s like Nightland on Zearth. A huge, themed amusement park you could stay the whole day and still not do everything. Tempting but I think Willow needs a pup break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did that. I overloaded my precious mateand this would make it worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nightland&#39;s capacity at any given day is 850,000 ride goers Coasters sit up to 5,000 at a time It would be exhausting for her and she&#39;s already tired. The amusement park is a Actual town. I bet the case is the same with Sunland.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn. I got mate stuff to deal with.&#34; I was about to teleport, but he sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just tell Willow what I told Samira.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;d you tell Samira?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The truth.&#34; He teleported</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I texted Rick. I was thankful that she shared her location with him I knew that stretch of interstate, she was about an hour away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew this teleport was going to be bad I knew it was, because I can&#39;t See inside when I do it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was pulled over, crying her eyes out, and I floated above. One more teleport, and I was kind of fused with the car seat a second, which Hurts, but it can be fixed if you&#39;re fast enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; She screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry. I&#39;m Alpha Kaizen I lead MisfitMoon.&#34; I offered to shake her wrist it was bruised. That scent was from Tyna. She&#39;s why she left. &#34;Nobody is going to hurt you ever again.&#34; I pulled her into a hug. I comforted her How broken her soul felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is not fair This was never meant to happen to one so sweet. Most little ones are. Sentinel asked my opinion on finding a woman for himself. Gloria wasn&#39;t interested.She changed her ways, taking a blood vow of chastity With time Reeta might.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let her cry on my shoulders. I petted her hair I could see bruising on her scalp too that takes a lot of force</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d never been embraced right She didn&#39;t know what a *real* mate bond is supposed to feel like with Tyna taking her frustration out on her Gloria too and any other Warrior who had a bad day, poor kid. They hazed her so bad because of Tyna and likely jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;s Supposed to be Luna after allAt any time, Green could have changed his mind. He&#39;s Alpha; he can do that so long as the bond wasn&#39;t snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They were Awful!&#34; She cried. &#34;She&#39;d flaunt him in front of me and he&#39;d let her  He said he didn&#39;t want a dirty Omega but but he made me feel special in private. That was Gabble Then Tyna scented him on me I took three showers but sinceand he just-I don&#39;t want him. Not after today. I can&#39;t do it anymore! They can have him!&#34; she cried more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyna may not be as strong as Gloria, I could scent that, but she was a Warrior How does grandma do this? How does she see what people like them do, and formally ask me to stop interfering? I burned the pink letter without reading it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew what it was, but also, I was scaring my new charge I need to calm down. Good thing she can&#39;t smell anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll drive you to your brother. He already has the access to add you.&#34; I said firmly. &#34;He sounded like a husky when the bond broke.&#34; I chuckle. &#34;Wa Wa Wa Wa.&#34; I imitated. She giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you my lord&#34; She mumbled. We switched seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bless that pup here and now. Let them be strong and proud Let them run with me, or even my brother Their life will be hard Multiple children exist from Green Multiple will grow up wanting to crack his skull for making their mothers cry</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He has I think 5 children now? The others weren&#39;t strong enough, so they left GreenMoon but I have a feeling the two in Misfit will</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I will aid them. I will train them myself with my boys. Even if they end up being Omegas, with my blood they will be Strong. Her cry turned into a quiet sniffle the rest of the way. It&#39;s hard to sit here and do nothing about it but I did what I could. Her child already has financial justice and I guess I&#39;ll have to do the rest of it myself. I know Green. He regrets it all now, but he won&#39;t come for her even if he does, the bond&#39;s gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;ll be like trying to win a mark mate once the bond snaps like that it&#39;s over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for fucking What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Green tossed his mate aside because she was an Omega, yet, that woman would have loved him. That pup is going to be his strongest pup They&#39;re the one from his mate. All pups from mates automatically get blessings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t see grandmother not blessing Reeta&#39;s pup extra. She&#39;s not only a discarded mate, but she was meant to be Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was discarded for women who Didn&#39;t want Him, they wanted to be Luna. He wanted strong women. Well now, he has nothing, except more pups ones that will grow up to come back and kill him.</p>
