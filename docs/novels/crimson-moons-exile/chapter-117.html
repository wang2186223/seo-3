                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left my mate asleep before she attacked me again I was starting to get sore. She treated me like a brand new toy yesterday but for now, the sex monster slumbered. She had her pump, and before bed she wanted me to give the extra milk to Flora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It only took a teleport, but all was not well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eternya couldn&#39;t be sensed, but I knew he was likely in the human town with Eskaal.. Elinore sat in a chair, looking traumatized I put the milk in the fucking fridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened *now*?&#34; I asked as my little ones finally got the hang of running. They ran to me, wagging their little tails. While we were gone, it seemed they figured out how to actually move with their feet under them proper. I won&#39;t tell Willow I&#39;ll let her see for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing up here boss!&#34; Shouted Ace. &#34;The water mages are installing pumps for the water tower.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. Can you handle the invoice?&#34; I asked. Time ticked If I went upstairs, I knew my vacation was OVER.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Already did!&#34; he shouted back.  Thank the gods. They were contracted, and don&#39;t live here, so it wouldn&#39;t have been right to not pay them on time.  &#34;Now what happened with Elinore?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Ma!] they gleefully chirped in wolf-speech, and I remembered I used to have trouble with this too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[It&#39;s papa.] I said picking them both up. They didn&#39;t care. I was &#39;ma&#39;. &#34;And how have you been doing?&#34; They babbled, trying to tell me about the grass. They were so fat too. Flora spoils them too much. I bet they&#39;ll be a whole pound heavier when I get back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I already saw, and honestly, as destructive as this is going to get, I was a little proud. I already set up an on-request petty cash reimbursement account before I left. Her hesitation made me motion her to speak by casually waving my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Well, father he blew up her old coven&#39;s leaders.&#34; Said Flora. &#34;He burned her parents pretty bad and they called her, and made her feel like it was her fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told him to give me some space my Lord. I told him only to get revenge on Ignis My coven was not kind. and now everyone, even my parents blame meThey say I should have lied to the Bird King. They said I should have told Old Ones lies of accidents That his anger was kindled on purpose because I didn&#39;t agree with the way Ignis, nor the elders did things&#34; Said Elinore. &#34;If you need him, he&#39;s with Lord Eskaal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gods damn it. It&#39;ll be alright Elinore.&#34; I said shaking my head I wasn&#39;t surprised. Love is a dangerous thing in the hands of an Old One.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eternya has never known love until Elinore; none of the Old Ones do to be fair. They were feared, and most didn&#39;t have childhoods or affection given to them. If they did, it was taken. At least, that&#39;s what Xaxas told me a long time ago, but I don&#39;t see him lying about something like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only closeness he ever had was with concubines. He went from a few moments of pleasure with women who obeyed in obligation, to a woman who actually likes him for who he is, and shared time with him, not just intimate time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I understand Before Willow it was all work, royal duties, and patrols My family cannot replace her; there&#39;s a whole section of my heart that was unclaimed before my wife. Eternya feels the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anything that harms her or upsets her in any way will have him fly off the handle. She&#39;s submissive and gentle, despite being a witch. You don&#39;t see that often. She shed tears, and I felt bad</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell, if Willow was burned like that, I&#39;d have used an arrow to leave a crater where the coven was. I&#39;d never seen, but I can pry. I knew through her thoughts that mostly her face, hands, and feet were the only things untouched by the spell Ignis put on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said nothing, merely staring at nothing in particular, holding her legs. She saw him use the same spell Ignis cast on her. She watched him boil him alive in his own blood. She&#39;s too green to have seen that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eternya.&#34; I said with a sigh. He appeared at the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She won&#39;t talk.&#34; He blurted. &#34;That&#39;s my fault.&#34; He hesitated to approach her. I can assume they must have fought about this too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No shit.&#34; I said shaking my head. &#34;Give me your report.&#34; I reached my hand out, and a black scroll appeared in it. He at least wrote his course of action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It said that he lost his temper for her sake, and became even more so when he found out she was hazed, mistreated, and traded for a gold ring The ring was why he did the report. It opens the way to his father&#39;s realm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That could be really bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apolis&#39;s world is all molten heat. It&#39;s one giant volcano worldI&#39;m glad the cultists didn&#39;t know such an item existed. That Elinore is from the third line of flame witches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m sure such an artifact was made and hidden in case they needed to flee in the old times. To use the ring like a portal, and maybe teleport by traveling within the protection of Valcanus, then appearing in a different spot on Urth. There could also be texts and relics there saved for such an event, but an experienced magic caster greater than a mere coven leader would be able to control such a portal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What would you have me do with it. The master said he didn&#39;t care.&#34; Said Eternya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas wouldn&#39;t care. To be honest I don&#39;t either. The ring&#39;s in probably no safer hands. It&#39;s currently wielded by someone who can use it, but doesn&#39;t want or need to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the event you think you&#39;re compromised, destroy it.&#34; I said seeing the pups &#39;attack&#39; the Bird King&#39;s already singed shoes the second they had a chance. My pups babbled in wolf speech. They kept saying &#39;ma&#39; in little yips. &#34;Eternya they&#39;re snitching on you.&#34; I sang. They may not talk, but they do have thoughts. They didn&#39;t like that he stopped their playtime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They can&#39;t even talk yet!&#34; He complained. It got Elinore to smile at least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since this was so serious, I felt it best not to laugh about it like I wanted. [That&#39;s enough.] I said moving them to the carpet. They really did enjoy the floor, since Flora still had toys a-plenty for them. Fireproof toys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be fine your highness.&#34; Said Elinore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to lie about it.&#34; I said as Eternya gently picked her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take her home.&#34; He offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to keep helping Flora.&#34; She complained. &#34;I&#39;m fine honest.&#34; She wiped her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can come back around 5 and help with dinner.&#34; He offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; She said letting him take her home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I needed to check Eskaal. If he was STILL here, there was a problem or he was tinkering. I was warned heavily about that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I better go see about the Beast Prince. Thank you Flora. I hate I&#39;m leaving you with all this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gods, I&#39;m left with puppies, you fiend.&#34; She said rolling her eyes. &#34;She&#39;s lucky her parents got off easy with burns. I still sense his absolute, unconsolably dangerous anger about it. Go deal with the Old Ones sir. Come here Vexi.&#34; Flora scooped him up and gave him tummy raspberries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He giggled. He did so by chuffing, something we do when something&#39;s funny, but we don&#39;t have the right vocal chord shape to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do that again.&#34; I said pulling out my phone. I&#39;d never heard them laugh, or smile. I almost missed their first giggle trying to have a vacation! &#34;I hate to leave.&#34; I complained. I did fuck around about 5 minutes before getting back to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a little bit, Willow will be waking. I need to hurry up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be fair though, She&#39;ll forgive me for any lost time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have krayptonite One day the boys are going to get onto me for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I teleported, then went downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eskaal was working, though thankfully none of the humans were turned to experiments. I don&#39;t think. The humans were in the town part, but Eskaal was at the edge, in the forested part. There was a grand park that surrounded the town. It had trails for jogging and water fountains. Sentinel even suggested to add pets down here for them if they wanted some, like dogs or cats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Beast Prince had his hands up making glowing circles with ancient writing in the air. I&#39;d never seen anything cast that way. Even when they made the demi-realm, you could see where they carved into the stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Master.&#34; Said Grahkes. He bowed while Eskaal was finishing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be patient.&#34; He said annoyed. &#34;If you stop pestering me, I&#39;ll buy you the blood ice cream you like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-&#34; Eskaal&#39;s sigh made him silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Know this is boring for you.&#34; He stopped the magic to pet his head. &#34;Give me 2 minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; He said quietly. Grahkes and Eskaal&#39;s relationship was like a talking dog and his master.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How goes it?&#34; I asked. Eskaal jumped because he was so engrossed into what he was doing, that he didn&#39;t notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me.&#34; He bowed, finishing his work by it slapping itself against the wall. To the humans it looked like the forest continued, but I could see the brick behind the illusion. &#34;I have two more walls left, but other than reinforcement, the initial groundwork wasn&#39;t too bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. When you&#39;re able, can you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already did.&#34; He smiled. &#34;No mortal of any kind will be able to enter, or remain in the barrier over the town should they have malicious intent for you or your kin. You should forward their first giggle to the master. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be elated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you know about that?&#34; I asked. Especially since he didn&#39;t even notice I was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was tapped into the land my lord. I know the workings of the town. You should investigate Warrior Egerton. He&#39;s actually at home while on the clock.&#34; He grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll link my Beta.&#34; I said a little pissed off. If I spend anymore time here, she&#39;s going to be on an island alone for days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could send my steed.&#34; He offered. Grahkes would probably just eat him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s fine, probably an accident or whatever. Don&#39;t forget to stop by Ace to get paid.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course sir.&#34; They both bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I teleported outside. I&#39;m positive I wouldn&#39;t get a connection to my Beta down there now with all the new magic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Ace, I&#39;ve been told a Warrior Egerton is at home, yet on the clock./ I linked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/He broke his leg around 1:49. I&#39;ll clock him out./  he said casually. /How&#39;s your vacation?/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Fun. There&#39;s no wifi, tv, or even electricity. It&#39;s so quiet/ The only thing that could be heard were the waves, birds, and wind. There was running water through magic, they took the salt out the water. The lights in the house were also magical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Then go back! You&#39;ve been here I think 20 minutes boss. / He linked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/SHIT!!!/ I yelled, not meaning to but that&#39;s a third of a day!!!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I teleported.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What took you so long?!&#34; she asked sweetly. She was on the bed I heard her moaning What did I get myself into.</p>
