                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The human men were hunters of my people. They will *not* be accepted The women are from a world riddled with high technology that *Cannot* be allowed to exist or worse, excite Eskaal. Being up here gives them access to human technology It&#39;s not a good idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pause.&#34; He made the time-out T with his hands. &#34;Think on it. I still feel like it&#39;ll do this world some good. I heard about a town called Sapphire. It&#39;s an entire city and pack merged together. Those people live in peace together&#34; Said Sentinel gruffly. &#34;Hybrids are accepted there too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the part that gave away his heart but I get it our world has been in this secret war so long, that there is much animosity for non-purebloods especially human hybrids</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I get it as a former human I can rightly say my people deserve at least *some* of that hate, but it shouldn&#39;t branch off to the children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but that town doesn&#39;t have people who become mindless-Holy shit I could give them my blood.&#34; Kaizen facepalmed. &#34;I&#39;m an idiot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;... I&#39;ll open the doors.&#34; Sentinel said getting keys off the wall. &#34;Wait I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll work though They belong to the Judge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll mass text the vampires. I already did this with Gilbert and Jack AND Flora&#39;s children..&#34; Kaizen said thinking out loud. &#34;But you&#39;re right The blood trick works by claiming them as the Horned One&#39;s, and claims me as their master within the Night Court but they already belong to the fold.. They already have a master&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll bring up a mortal, but keep the door locked then. We can test it first.&#34; Said Sentinel leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll text the vampires and ghouls.&#34; Said Kaizen getting out his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The undead silently came to the summons of their coven leader. Kaizen sat at the makeshift desk in Sentinel&#39;s office, and I sat next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had a good feeling about this If it works, the ghouls won&#39;t be as cursed They&#39;ll still need really gross stuff but at least they won&#39;t lose their minds anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were 8 ghouls here now, but Mrs. Lancaster could control the vampires. She daintily floated in here like a ghost while the vampires walked, and the ghouls crawled on all 4&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I fear what you wish may not work.&#34; She still floated about a foot off the ground. It meant Mrs. Lancaster was an elder vampire, but the ghouls. They felt off more than my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They smelled unstable</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their scent made me uneasy, and it made me glad I left the kids with Flora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Bart Lancaster, 5th cousin thrice removed to the mistress in life a ghoul in death.&#34; He smiled. &#34;Your highness, you told us you wish us to partake of your blood?&#34; he bowed. He did look like Mrs. Lancaster, except his hair was thick, curly, and looked more salt than pepper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whites of his eyes though were a sickly yellow, and the irises were teal...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen bit his wrist. &#34;I think you should be the first. Get in a line; let&#39;s see if this works. I only need the ghouls; vampires have control so long as nobody is starved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, they drank his blood, but unlike Ellio or Jack, their scent didn&#39;t really change. Those two examples smell slightly of my mate, though these guys just gained a symbol of Scales marked on their necks... It flashed black and red a few times before disappearing. Meaning I think this was a failure?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say anything. I didn&#39;t know if I was right or not None of them passed out either, another common thing..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Flesh.&#34; All the ghouls said at the same time, but thankfully they only ran to a closed, locked door that burned them. They hissed in pain from the blessed light Sentinel made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I brought Dan. Stand behind me.&#34; Said Sentinel. &#34;I don&#39;t know *why* this doesn&#39;t work, but I&#39;m thankful I didn&#39;t open the door yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a soundless teleportation of the Realm King. He appeared in the center of the room in officer uniform. He was about 12 feet tall, clearly pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas wore an officer hat sat on top of the flaming crown as well, and it kind of spun in a counterclockwise, slow rotation. It would be comical if not for how clearly upset he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It won&#39;t work because what the Fuck do you think you&#39;re doing to MY mortals Boy.&#34; Growled Xaxas. He appeared from nowhere, but the room was red with the light from his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was trying-&#34; Kaizen got cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were trying to let your ants out their hidey-hole. These are *my* people, and they *already* belong to the fold.&#34; He said with crossed arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen bowed, probably unable to think of anything I didn&#39;t hold much fear for Xaxas but my mate did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well?&#34; Xaxas demanded. Nobody said a peep, but I stepped forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was just trying to do a nice thing but we understand if he can&#39;t.&#34; I bowed It just kind of happened on its own, but I also felt like if I was sassy or snippy, I&#39;d lose my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just might mortal.&#34; He hissed at me with narrowed eyes. &#34;*The undead are mine.* Do *not* try this again nephew; I will not be so understanding next time. That goes for the dragons, demons, vulpines, and anything else that belongs to the Night Court. The only reason you get away with wolves is because mother allows it willingly.&#34; He took a few breaths. His crown&#39;s flames were more like a campfire</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive my overstep uncle. It won&#39;t happen again.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m alright&#34; I could tell he was *clearly lying* but he forced his crown to disappear. &#34;Are my eyes still red? I got work in 30 minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;You feel like you&#39;d kill a regular mortal with that aura if they got too close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit. I got a mortal rookie this week.&#34; He complained. He closed his eyes, and when he opened them, they were normal. &#34;How about now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re ruby but some aviators will cover that.&#34; Said Sentinel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas put on shades I have to admit the uniform and shades did go together. His hat sat between his horns, which slowly disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You work?&#34; I asked, changing the subject, but also, I figured it would help him calm down He breathed black smoke with every breath... His aura was not the goofy guy who likes messing around</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got too comfortable. I forgot how much of a monster they all are; they pretend to be mortal because it&#39;s fun</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat in Kaizen&#39;s chair, shrinking to do so. I gave him a cup of coffee. Sentinel made it with his *special* coffee and French press that no one is allowed to touch. I swear him and Kaizen drink a whole pot a day. The K-Cup machine was fair game for that reason I liked the blueberry muffin one of those.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sentinel you like the good stuff I see. Made with love.&#34; Xaxas sipped it with a hum. &#34;Each bean picked by a farmer that owns their land you have to give me your supplier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye Lord Judgment.&#34; He rummaged around and passed the Realm King a business card. &#34;But I&#39;m also curious if you permit it... &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do if only for the coffee, and my curiosity of your question. You know how to hide your thoughts.&#34; Grinned Xaxas. Now he was back to &#39;normal&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really aid the Kings?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I work. Harmony is the director of the Feed the Need Project with the Great-great-great grandchildren of the mortals who started the nonprofit. They don&#39;t know who we are though. I&#39;m a 1st lieutenant of the Secret Police, the Bison City of Jentuky location with Jerold and the unicorns. It&#39;s boring but needed. Because I have an office there, they can&#39;t hide shit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I imagine so.&#34; I said seeing Kaizen and Sentinel LEAVE ME!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Assholes!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I even occasionally get to use this thing.&#34; He summoned his gun. &#34;So far, I&#39;ve only used it at the range. It got pretty fucking peaceful when people found out I&#39;m there, and I *actually* do my job.&#34; He said casually. &#34;And don&#39;t worry. They aren&#39;t slick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to smite-&#34; I was cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m still pissed, but I don&#39;t want to get Arviel in my face about his little project, and my brother pissed I put a dick on his son&#39;s forehead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can do that?!&#34; I stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fucking Duh Willow.&#34; He rolled his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gods do it.&#34; I whisper yelled. &#34;Not forever though&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; is 90 seconds alright?&#34; He said waving his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AH! WHAT THE FUCK?!&#34; screamed Kaizen from outside. &#34;AH! I NEED HEAD PANTS!&#34; I RAN to try and catch him before he bolted, but he can flipping teleport. Shit! I wanted that photo; it was the &#39;only&#39; reason why. That&#39;s what he gets for being a dickhead and leaving me to babysit a disgruntled god.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone dinged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message said &#39;from a babysat disgruntled god.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome.&#34; Said Xaxas behind me. &#34;Anyway. I hope that teaches that little shit not to just go around pissing on everyone&#39;s lawn. He&#39;s lucky he hasn&#39;t stolen anyone anybody had specific plans for. No one can stop father, but they can punish him. Oh, and he only left because he thought I&#39;d only get him. He&#39;s right. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Realm King chuckled completely amused, knowing full well that Kaizen was flapping around trying to find &#39;head pants&#39;.</p>
