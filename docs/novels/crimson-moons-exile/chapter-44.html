                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked not quite knowing what to make of not only where I was, but also . Who I stood in front ofand the dread that came with my eyes meeting his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This man looked like Mr. Bryson yet, even though he looked the same, he looked like he was no older than 35.  He wore black robes with glowing words on them, and under my feet was little red beads They had to be the size of sand, but they were clear like rubies</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes reminded me of Kaizen as well, though his whites were black, and he held red eyes. A floating crown floated between horns bigger than Kaizen&#39;s father as wellI could literally feel the aura of cruelty and power of him.. He was the Horned One there was no doubt about it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Small mortal. My son has been tested, yet, none have tested You.&#34; He said with a sinister smile I felt crushed like his words held actual weight. Even though he whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dear, leave the poor mortal alone.&#34; Said a sweet voice She held pale skin and blue eyes, but I&#39;d seen her before She was the Moon Goddess and I stood before the One person I hoped I&#39;d never meet. Her embrace felt sweet as honey. But his gave me instant fear</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I only went to her belly button, but she went only to the bottom of his chest I was a literal ant to this man</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bowed like I&#39;d seen others do with the rest of the royalty. It doesn&#39;t get mor royal than the Lord of Night, the Lord&#39;s rival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your highness, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything to test. Compared to all of you, I&#39;m just a human.&#34; I said hearing him boom a laugh. I was bowed, but glancing around, I could tell even his demons were afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I like this one.&#34; He chuckled. He petted my head.  I know I made the right decision to be respectful. &#34;You are mortal, yet you hold enough sway to send my General to Hell, to not only *Want* to Change, but also to *Actually* do it, not just carry out his penance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t scare her.&#34; The Moon Goddess huffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I can&#39;t help that.&#34; He complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she defended me, I tried to take the opportunity to leave. All those eyes were on me. There were so many monsters in the crowd I know for a fact that I wouldn&#39;t get far, but my plan was thwarted nearly instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t try to escape.&#34; He growled. &#34;Stop wiggling too.&#34; I was lifted in the air with whatever magic he had, and placed on the ground again But when I blinked I was somewhere different</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This place held smooth black floors, walls, and on said walls were elegant paintings and statues They had to have been done by a professional. I think this was a throne room His throne was made for him, someone at least 14 feet tall. While hers was for someone her size.Maybe a foot and a half taller than Kaizen? Nearly, but not quite half that. They were black, carved with horrified faces so real I could swear they might blink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why thank you, but flattery will get you nowhere.&#34; He said ominously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See, you scare her enough that she wants to leave.&#34; She protested. &#34;Your test is not one of might or strength yours is of your heart.&#34; She said sweetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; I only agreed because she asked me. And I didn&#39;t have much of a choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet I no longer yearned for Kaizen. I went from missing him to being fine. I didn&#39;t feel any particular way about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re safely in his arms. We&#39;re only holding you a few seconds of Urth&#39;s time, but down here, we may take as long as we want.&#34; She beamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but we won&#39;t keep her forever dear.&#34; Said the Horned One. He sat on his throne, as well as the Moon Goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now I ask you In my infinite power, I could give you your old life I won&#39;t rewind time&#34; He said with a scoff &#34;You know what, I Would rewind time.&#34; He scratched his chin. &#34; I would undo all this, every event, every memory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Husband&#34; said the Moon Goddess quietly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Lulliba I must be fair.&#34; He said waving his hand, and I could see my friends and me welcomed home with a surprise party Typical mom We were going to see them before we went back to our lives It was on the other side of a portal  &#34;All you have to do is walk through it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda and Drew were going to get married, and they both wanted a ton of kids. But as selfish as I was, they have their afterlife together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would teach again But I couldn&#39;t be without Kaizen. How could I leave someone who killed for me sacrificed everything, even becoming a criminal, and just embraced it. For me Risking his life too. If not for Wix, I KNOW they would have killed him before they paid him that much money. Or called his brother</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can make it so that you and your friends arrived with you to that surprise party. I&#39;d wipe all your memories I&#39;d give you three compensations for the grizzly deaths and your capture. You&#39;d win the lottery. I believe I made it 66.4 million.&#34; He smiled. &#34;One word and you get your life back the one robbed by Kaizen After all, you were never meant to be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand.&#34; I said shaking my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He marked you the moment he saw you It forced the connection, one that we worked with, but you were meant to live a boring human life with a boring human.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was silent completely surprised but not I Knew it was too good to be true, but I wouldn&#39;t let go of this now that I had it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must admit I heard your prayers, being a Goddess of Love as well.. However, you are made by Arviel.&#34; She said a little angrily. &#34;The King of the Light Court still holds rights over you because of this. Yet you are branded by my husband. You are not either of ours. So should you break the bond, you are free to be married to a human. I&#39;ll even make sure he&#39;s bound to you as my grandson was Is this fair?&#34; Asked the Moon Goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like whiplash Nothing could compare. I&#39;d never loved or had been loved like This.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want immortality instead, I can provide that. What can I trade you?&#34; The King of Hell asked sitting up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no hesitation to my answer I stood tall, looking him in the eyes He looked offended that I stood so proud but I would be honest and I would not back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must firmly decline, your majesty.&#34;  I said this out my mouth but the words came on their own. &#34;My whole life. I always envisioned a connection like this yet I knew my whole life that it couldn&#39;t happen Every night I wished for this bond, even when I was little . Werewolves and other immortal peoples get mates Humans get partners.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if his marking stamped you before you agreed?&#34; He asked with a raised brow he looked almost like he didn&#39;t like my answer. &#34;You stand before a god that can give you whatever you desire, even if you wish to be a goddess yourself, and rule a realm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if he marked me first. I still want thisI still chose him later, influence or not too. And above all. what&#39;s the point of Everything we went through what he went through today if I leave him for trinkets and titles.&#34; I mumbled. &#34;What a spit in his face would it be to simply leave him for something as petty as money I do miss my friends somewhat, but not enough that I would forsake my forever&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He literally served a sentence in hell because of ME We ran clear across the country only to be caught, and see him have to nearly kill his brother I&#39;d be worse than a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well said.&#34; He mumbled. &#34;In this room, only truths can be said. You are good for my blood. Had you wavered even a *little* I would have sent you to whatever life you hesitated on that even with your connection paused, you still love my grandson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Husband we both knew that already. Was it not you who cheered when she accepted him?&#34; The Moon Goddess grinned he looked a little deflated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s *Besides* the point. But I do wonder one thing. Little Grace has a point.&#34; He said scratching his chin. &#34;We should turn you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish to remain as I am if it means I&#39;ll be mindless&#34; I said again without any say so I confessed my truest thoughts in here there was no filter to say things more politely to the King of Hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Needed my children to be Vicious, cunning, and instinctual in battle&#34; He waved his hand a large red portal showed. This had to be the future? The three siblings were shifting between human and wolf forms to fight angels. &#34;This outcome did not happen, but it could have. But now You are the only outlier. I was going to make Kaizen&#39;s mate a demon.yet my mate jumped on you when Kaizen marked you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But since he didn&#39;t start on Kaizen&#39;s wife, I made you his true mate. Arviel gave your soul away so easily.&#34; She mumbled. &#34;We worry if you remain human, he may try something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That kind of stung they wanted me to reject Kaizen so they could-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You misunderstand.&#34; They said at the same time, but the Moon Goddess clarified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We Needed to test you Humans They are more flexible than our peoples. At least, when it comes to relationships My people don&#39;t have the ability to be dumped, or &#39;just find another&#39; even demons mate only One partner once they declare it so and you&#39;ve only been together a short time We needed to be Sure you want this too Technically I wronged you. You were meant to die, and I felt so bad I convinced Zuviel to release your friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All who die by my children are mine I traded them for you.&#34; He said simply. &#34;But her tears were *very* convincing too.&#34; He shook his head. &#34;What am I to do with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He yanked me to him with his magic. I was slowly spun around and when our eyes met again, he looked deathly serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t want to be turned, but I Can&#39;t keep you  *human*&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it that bad?&#34; I asked a little offended I Should be terrified His burning eyes seemed to be neutral</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arviel made you. Without alteration, I could see him using you for another one of his intricate schemes, ignoring the brand I placed Fuck, Tamriel took you to his lair and hid your presence from your soulmate...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he just wanted to make sure I wasn&#39;t bad&#34; I said looking at my feet. I didn&#39;t want to defend his actions, but I did want to stay as I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angels and demons follow their master&#39;s orders. Don&#39;t think for a Second that that fucker Arviel didn&#39;t sit high on his throne, look down, notice You, and ordered Tamriel to do that. The flick of his wrist would slit your throat, and he&#39;d have taken your soul to his sadistic brother and Rot in Purgatory while the end of all things raged below You&#39;d be Humblon, the God of Mercy&#39;s *pet to pick apart* . I will not have my little ones be pawns in Arviel&#39;s silly games.&#34; He said sternly.</p>
