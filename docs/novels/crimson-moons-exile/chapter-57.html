                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The endless wall of pinkish scales went up as far as I could seeI could not fathom how large this beast was. I had to be in Tarteron</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hahaha Mortal!&#34; Snarled a 15 foot tall demon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I screamed and ran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who wouldn&#39;t?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a creature with a face made of deer skull, though the antlers were a ram&#39;s. His body was stocky like a minotaur&#39;s, though his fur was shaggy and black, covered in glowing red tattoos even on his face. He wore only a red cloth around his waist, but he brandished a club as big as me. He had to be damn near 15 feet tall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Running will get you Nowhere!&#34; Laughed the demon evilly. &#34;Welcome to the Layer of-Shit! I didn&#39;t see your mark! Wait Little Mistress! I can&#39;t keep up with all the new faces!&#34; He yelled as if he were apologizing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bumped into white robes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not this again.&#34; Said the voice a little agitated. He held my shoulders, and I tried fighting him. Could I win? No, but it didn&#39;t stop me from trying! &#34;Calm Down. You&#39;re safe here. That&#39;s my husband, Noirnamu.&#34; He smiled. &#34;I am Apythmenos the Bottomless One, the Pit given flesh, Herold of the Horned OneBut you hold his mark, therefore we will not harm you unless he says so Were you tossed down here, X-less mortal? This is the Last Layer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked. Beautiful. His aura made me want to run away, but his youthful face and golden antlers made him look like he could be trusted.  If the saying &#39;appearances can be deceiving&#39; had a face in the dictionary it would be his. He was a demon who&#39;s face and body mimicked an angel&#39;s. even the robes were the wrong color</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the mighty, nearly endless Asian styled, winged dragon in the sky. There was no way I was escaping someone like that. I hated the feeling this place gave me Like I was in trouble, yet I hadn&#39;t actually done anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t tossed, I just woke up here Some man with a purple flame torch killed King Jerold and Noah and Tamriel. They fought as beams of light in the sky; that had to be him and his son I don&#39;t know who the gold light in the sky was though, but he fell too&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know those names. Let me take you to the master. He&#39;ll know what to do. &#34;I&#39;m still making pasta tonight; this shouldn&#39;t take long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re not back by 10, I&#39;m starting Breaking Bad without you and ordering Dominos from... from Mortal DoorDash again!&#34; countered his massive husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gasped &#34;You Wouldn&#39;t! That shit was 30 Gold Pieces with the delivery fee!&#34; He shouted. &#34;And they got your order wrong!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will!&#34; He yelled playfully. &#34;Forgive my rudeness my lady. I am Noirnamu, caretaker of the Pit, this jackass.&#34; He pointed at Apythmenos with a thumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Willow, Kaizen&#39;s mate.&#34; I said sheepishly for them to be so friendly was because of my connection with my mate. I was silently thankful for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both chuckled. &#34;It&#39;s only 4; there&#39;s no way I&#39;d be gone that long.&#34; He scoffed, picking me up. &#34;You&#39;re all one piece at least but you&#39;re just a soul.&#34; He complained, taking off. He sprouted white dragon wings, and we were high in the air nearly instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not Dead Yet!&#34; I yelled, and he smiled, shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As far as I know, you are, but if you&#39;re still alive, your body&#39;s in a coma somewhere. Did he say anything to you?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only what year it was.&#34; I mumbled. He flew over the Pit. I had goosebumps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t drop you. Even if I did; I&#39;d catch you before you got hurt.&#34; He said rolling his eyes. &#34;Sorry, I picked that up from the Mistress.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Moon Goddess?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s surprisingly sassy.&#34; He smiled. &#34;Over there is the gate little Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear moans of people inside. They screamed in agony, but he didn&#39;t seem to care. It was his job after all. Those down there were so evil that they were deemed unredeemable. They hurt countless, like Jack Living so long, it allowed him to keep killing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A human would have eventually died after a few years So it would forcibly end their terrible actions, but a supernatural that unhinged lives until they&#39;re stopped If Jack lived to 80, killing a person every day, he&#39;d never reach the number he has today Not by hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jack isn&#39;t all that special.&#34; Said the Pit. &#34;Sorry, it&#39;s passive. I&#39;m sure since you&#39;re so young everyone does that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They do&#34; I grumbled. He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll teach you. Time here isn&#39;t the same.&#34; He said happily. &#34;But also, I&#39;ve tossed men with triple his count from other worlds. Some used bombs or culled countries with their soldiers, but the loss of life is still a loss. I Really hope you aren&#39;t dead.&#34; He said ominously. &#34;Lord Kaizen might be trained to control his nature, but with your death will come willing carnage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-&#34; I was cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve not seen what the Master&#39;s bloodline is capable of not truly. He&#39;s half his father. So he holds half the power of a Prince of Hell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Kaizen-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could no longer feel my mate. It wasn&#39;t like last time Then, I Knew grandfather had her but this time I only felt a fading fear as if her light was snuffed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved myself up, leaving the humans inside their cell, and my new fold on the floor. They&#39;d have to wake up like that. They were safe; my mate was not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I coughed blood getting outside and forcing my powers to zip across the sky. The impact of me landing cracked the street, and the Lord of Contradiction. He certainly looked it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything about him seemed off He was symmetrically dysfunctionalHaving either too much or little of many physical features, but his right side mirrored his left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What have you done to my mate?&#34; I growled in demonic. I couldn&#39;t help myself. Seeing her laid there as her little fox She was shifted and shaking. I did not feel her soul either, but her heart beat</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I summoned my bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will not ask again.&#34; I snarled, worried for her. His fanged smile was horrid They ended in flat tips, like shark teeth were sawed off at the tips, and they were brown, being double rowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked for the time. It is not my fault the mortal could not handle my aura.&#34; He said turning to me. &#34;I will Not go back.&#34; He hissed. &#34;I will not go back to my prison or that little blue bitch&#39;s barrier and *prayers*.&#34; He sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t give a fuck what you do or where you go, so long as my mate isn&#39;t involved.&#34; I growled. &#34;But the issue is that you Force my involvement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will destroy this world. Everything but not Everyone on it that they may see the error of their folly to the End.&#34; He responded in oddly enough. High Angel How did I understand that language?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you?&#34; I asked. He looked every bit a villain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The bastard of my father&#39;s making.&#34; He said raising his torch, but I parried his swing meant for Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slid backwards into Jerold&#39;s innards He was cleaved in half, but still alive. Kings cannot be killed He&#39;d be up in a day or so, but fuck if that looked like that hurt. Noah&#39;s heart beat as well but he was unconscious</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I prevented myself from shifting in my anger. I needed to stay in this form to deal with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I caught him by surprise. Had he been whole, I doubt I could take you both.&#34; He snarled, rushing me. The Lord of Contradiction sounded like a lion, though I could tell he couldn&#39;t shift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My bow had to be wielded like a sword since he used his torch like a club. We clashed in the street while my people screamed and evacuated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Jack protect Willow./ I linked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The explosion from our next clash caused the neighbors&#39; homes and mine to be unlivable. Our shattered front doors and crumbled porches were on fire from his flames, except Flora&#39;s. Hers seemed to have a magic dome over it. He didn&#39;t link back, but when I looked for her again, my precious Willow was gone as I&#39;d ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I didn&#39;t have to hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s Going On Out Here?!&#34; screamed Flora, clawing herself across the chest and jumping high in to the air. The transformation of a Great Fire Bird was what I needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I teleported backwards, shooting him in the heart with the thickest, most barbed arrow I could create, while she breathed fire on him. He screamed in pain being shocked by my lightning, because in my anger I lost my composure. I was so mad that I teleported to him, but he dodged the punch meant for his fucking smug ass face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pointed the torch and shot Flora&#39;s wing. She screeched, but as a fire bird, it didn&#39;t hurt her too bad. She lost feathers, diving at him with her claws out. I didn&#39;t speak Eagle, so whatever she said I doubt either of us knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I teleported, grabbing two of his arms, while the other two were pinned with a knee I only managed to do that from experience with spider demons. They have multiple arms to but this man spoke angel</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he definitely was a demigod I could sense that naturally</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d rather not die right now.I&#39;ll see you later.&#34; He said becoming water in my hands, covering me with slime. He streaked across the sky as purple light, headed west.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;EW!&#34; I yelled, upset that he escaped, and more upset that I felt like I&#39;d been hag fished! &#34;Ugh it smells!&#34; It burned. &#34;It&#39;s In my eyes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flora Shifted, grabbing my hand and leading me to the side of her house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold still.&#34; She said worriedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressure washed me, and my skin went with it. I couldn&#39;t breathe It smelled like holy water, but stunk like sulfur too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flushed my eyes until I could see again, but Flora looked. Disturbed by me. I chalked it up to the melted skin that healed rapidly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to find Willow. You stay and protect your son. Gather the witches to douse the fires, and send the wolves to find the bodies of Tamriel, Sentinel and Gettriel.&#34; I said ripping the tattered melting cloth off me it was wet and became goo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You might want to put on some shades first.&#34; She mumbled.</p>
