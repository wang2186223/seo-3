                <p>Eternya</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I landed, many came out to kneel I did so with an explosive crash that left the earth scorched but not *too much.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I had a small fry to deal with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood naked in his front yard, and it only took seconds for prince and pauper alike to run to kneel to the son of their maker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Highness!&#34; Yelled Lord Ignis. I wish my wife were here, but if she was, I&#39;d have to edit my actions greatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You, your house, the House of Redbrand, and the House of Flambrand have been Judged.&#34; I boomed. They screamed as they were dragged to my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let us gather them.&#34; Many frantically begged, running inside to gather even the stragglers. Their fellow witches did not hesitate, nor did the abusers resist much. Well they couldn&#39;t... thousands of people lived here, and hundreds stormed the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You lot are to die.&#34; I said holding the urge to destroy this whole town. It would only take the smallest effort too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait-Wait-WAIT your highness!&#34; Screamed the coven leader.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lord Ignis was brought in front, and I stood there. He looked mortified, despite the scars on his face. The irony a fire witch burned by flame. The witch&#39;s ruby, molten hair and glowing orange eyes told me that father gave him the highest of blessings, but to me, he may as well be a flickering candle in front of a bonfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blew up an escapee with an annoyed glance. &#34;Anyone else?&#34; I asked impatiently. Brooms were tossed to the ground. I was *much* faster than a fucking broom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It insulted me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What have we done great one? I will take full responsibility.&#34; Said Ignis. &#34;Spare my new bride. She isn&#39;t even from this coven. Please sire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.hmm.. no.&#34; I said pretending to give a fuck. I snapped my fingers. She was first. Then the other women next to her, I believe her maids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO!&#34; He yelled. &#34;Gods.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There is nothing left to bury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Funny how you mourn her, yet you burned my poor wife so badly that she won&#39;t show her arms, legs, nor torso because you couldn&#39;t take &#39;no&#39; for an answer.&#34; I said casually then the wheels turned in his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bowed on hands and knees. &#34;I formally reject Elinore Flambrand. Please, I can heal her marks!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already did mortal.&#34; I said with a scoff. &#34;If you were so worried about consequences, you shouldn&#39;t have put hands on Elinore You will PAY for marring her so badly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young master&#34; Said Elinore&#39;s father. He looked too much like her, and smelled old enough to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You interrupt?&#34; I asked with a raised brow. He bowed, taking off a ring, and presenting it to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is the most prized possession of our entire people. Her dowery, the Ring of Fire. This is what Lord Ignis wanted.&#34; Her mother came to bow with him, but I wouldn&#39;t kill her parents. I wouldn&#39;t add to her sorrow. But they agreed with this. There Will be punishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They are the ones who arranged this. For that, I burned their arms. Not enough to even leave a scar, but enough to pass judgment. They screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elinore was caught ablaze. for a trinket?&#34; I put it on my pinky only because it was meant for her. With the heat of my flames, I sized the too small ring to fit. . The stone was from father&#39;s realm, living obsidian, and the carving on it was a volcano erupting. The gold circle around it held god-speech.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That is a language I can&#39;t really speak well, but I was divine enough to understand it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;This is the way.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way to Nothing. I thought this in my anger I couldn&#39;t break the damn thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It enraged me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for now, my anger, nor violent desires could not be satisfied. My volcanic nature got the better of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ll admit that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignis&#39;s brother, his brother&#39;s children, and his sister were next now he had no bloodline. The Redbrands were next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir spare us!&#34; Shouted someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caught the mortal alight. No water could quinch my flames, not without my permission, or the absence of air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They begged How they screamed. He watched the fall of the house of Redbrand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t give a single fuck of who was innocent or guilty either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t care if they&#39;re old, young, or disabled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They angered the man who destroyed his entire people by my master&#39;s request. I am why there are so few phoenix and fire birds. I took pride in it, as I do with this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For them I let them burn slowly. They became as incinerated, thrice baked bread before I allowed them to perish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes as the last 4 ran, and I popped them from the inside out, one by one until I was covered in their blood Now I was satisfied. Last was Ignis. I let him live as I dragged the bodies inside his home. Well, the random limbs and such.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My master&#39;s son, please. I have nothing left.&#34; He cried bitter tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was traded for a ring. A bobble A Shiny.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing special about it, was that it had my father&#39;s crest  If it had power, it was too weak to detect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he has the nerve to fucking ask for mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I probably need a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used the garden hose attached to the mansion, ignoring the mass pleas. The water felt nice, then I lit the house ablaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*Now* you have nothing left.&#34; I got a lawn chair and was given a glass of wine. Ignis was my footstool, and he shed tears for his fallen. I really didn&#39;t care. I was nice enough to let the rest of them skitter like mice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commoners would have fried nicely, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;d be punished for destroying the town</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please kill me, that I can see my kin.&#34; He asked completely broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bold of you to assume I&#39;ll allow that.&#34; I said with a dark chuckle. It&#39;s been a *long* time since I got to really Truly do my favorite pastime. He&#39;s coming home with me. I chuckled a little louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched the last bits of the mansion smolder while fire mages made sure it didn&#39;t spread. They asked permission for that, and I allowed it. I waisted about 2 hours here, too long shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took Ignis by the scruff and shifted. He&#39;d burn in my talons. I would give him no respite. I will not bestow fire resistance on him Not even his clothes. Nudity is not common with them. He will feel shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got to the station, I got one of the wolves to open a spare cage. It was one made for supernaturals, so he wouldn&#39;t burn down the master&#39;s efforts. He was passed out, and I was given a bucket of water for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; He yelled. His first instinct was to cover himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There. Heal yourself and don&#39;t make trouble.&#34; I said using the station phone to call my wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She came Immediately. She also lookedI don&#39;t know</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me Elninore.&#34; He bowed &#34;I should have this is divine punishment&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It .*probably* was? Father was created to manage the heat made by Lia I inherited his volcanic temper, but that was about the only thing he ever did for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see father hearing the prayers of my wife when all this happened, and being angered. She is as pure as a puppy. I could see him being angered by such a young, beautiful girl that could have been given as an offering, yet instead is made &#39;ugly&#39; for lack of a better word purposefully</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wonder did he soften my heart to the idea of monogamy in the first place, to spite his own people. Nah, that would require effort, and paying attention to his eldest, only living child. I&#39;d be surprised if he knew of Flora, especially little Ellio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only reason he knew of my affair with Allivaldi was because of the trial her and my daughter endured. They&#39;d made their own cult with the crowkin, and for it them, and that entire race of people were banished off the planet. I don&#39;t know what world, but at least they weren&#39;t given a strange or malicious curse</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. I can smell the ashes Eternya.&#34; She almost whispered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt ashamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They marred you. They took your confidence and your happiness. They got what they deserved.&#34; I said angrily. It made her put a hand on my chest. I could feel how cool her skin was. I did calm down for her sake. With a labored breath I powered down</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t want anyone else to be involved I didn&#39;t need to gain a reputation as the scorned woman who embellished my story, and made the master&#39;s son strike his wrath on my people. That&#39;s all the remaining witches will say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;ElinoreThey have no right.&#34; I said trying to soothe her, but she only shed more tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe it&#39;ll die down. My father will lead the coven now, just like he wanted.&#34; She shed blood tears as she glared at him. &#34;But every one of them got what they deserved Nearly Everyone sided with him even my father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were to marry before you were even born. Redbrand And the house of Flambrand arranged it. Your father, Carter, and Gladis Redbrand offered a dowery You weren&#39;t there to see the master&#39;s blood slay them.&#34; He hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t have to be!&#34; She shouted. &#34;All you had to do was just accept that every woman isn&#39;t-isn&#39;t twirling her skirt for you! That maybe I didn&#39;t accept you because I knew you only wanted me for the ring!&#34; She stammered completely flustered. &#34;All you had to do was let me leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All you had to do was accept the betrothment!&#34; He shouted back. &#34;Had you, you would have learned the Secrets of the Entire fucking coven! We could have recovered the ancient texts of our people too! Everything! But you just wanted to be spoiled!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t spoiled; you&#39;re a rude, power hungry boar! You didn&#39;t even *like* meYou belittled me, and treated me as a used rag. You didn&#39;t even TRY to court, be nice, or even tell me a &#39;hello&#39; in passing.&#34; She glared at him with a hatred I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever see from one so passive She doesn&#39;t even like squishing bugs; she makes me do it. &#34;You allowed the coven to treat me like shit because of MY choice. The Right one! If you&#39;d have used that ring, your weakness would have made it unstable. It wasn&#39;t made for mortal use!&#34; She hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the weak one you little shit. I would have made us comparable to the House of Sunstone.&#34; He shouted in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I am to savor this later, it&#39;s best they start off whole. Torture was one of my specialties... I&#39;ve tortured some humans so long, that they died of old age. But that was the old days I&#39;d use him to knock the rust off my claws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt Elinore&#39;s cold hands  I lowered my fiery nature</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That reminds me, do you want your dowery?&#34; I asked. It was hers as far as I was concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only the men may wear it a Flambrand my father or the husband of a Flambrand....&#34; She said completely upset. She didn&#39;t say why, but I did Not care what this trinket did. Whatever it was, wasn&#39;t special enough to warrant hurting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That half unlocks the way to-&#34; I cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be Silent.&#34; I hissed. I took Elinore by the hand. &#34;Do you wish to watch, or may I have my merry way?&#34; I asked looking at her concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I don&#39;t, you&#39;ll never kill him.&#34; She said knowing me already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she didn&#39;t say the last part. She won&#39;t mentally heal without knowing for herself that he&#39;s gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell my father I said hi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made a heat containing sphere and cooked him alive. That death takes about 3 minutes, but even his soul will be damaged when he arrives to my father. With the spell like this, it won&#39;t trigger the sprinklers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went too far, as she was upset from seeing that, but I knew she recognized the spell She didn&#39;t let me ask about it, since she ran off. I let her. This spell was made to execute prisoners. It&#39;s meant to bring shame to fire mages of all ranks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An armored hand was placed on my shoulder. &#34;I know you hurt Eternya, but your flames are warping the cell.&#34; Said Sentinel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His ashes were white. They glowed red hot from my anger as I glared at his dust. Even this wasn&#39;t good enough.</p>
