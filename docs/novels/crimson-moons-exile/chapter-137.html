                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My giblets were put back where they belonged, but it didn&#39;t stop me from being Heckled to no end!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I only left because I needed air!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That and I knew he&#39;d only get *me* with his punishment. He&#39;d already said himself that punishment should be paws off the mates</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wound up hiding within the human part of town They didn&#39;t see. Thank the gods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ll never live this down. I rubbed my forehead one more time. Everything was where it was supposed to be!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lord Kaizen!&#34; Shouted Dan, the human leader.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, hey.&#34; I said playing off how embarrassing this still was. Had he been a few seconds sooner. Ugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas comes up with such unusually cruel punishments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They seem friendly, but I swear something&#39;s off with them.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have they done anything suspicious?&#34; I asked. &#34;Like gathering wires or asking about how things work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. And yeah, but they don&#39;t get too far.&#34; Said Dan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll talk to them. Give &#39;um a warning. Oh, and,&#34; I leaned in to whisper this. I didn&#39;t know if anyone with prying ears was around. &#34;They come from a world destroyed for their technology. It poisons the land and deforms your children. It makes even the air sulfurous and pungent.. so stale they actually sold respirators and air purifiers that ran by the hour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Holy shit, and you *brought* them here?&#34; Whisper-yelled Dan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s either stay a sausage fest, or shoot your shot at one of them. I didn&#39;t pick any ugly ones did I?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re cute, but what you said is more important than a damn date!&#34; He hissed, except it was hushed. &#34;Why&#39;d you put something so dangerous on ME TO LOOK AFTER?! WHY ME!?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because like I said it was spur of the moment. Maybe I should have bought you women they&#39;d already be in your beds by now.&#34; I said thinking out loud before I vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On hearing his frustrated growl, maybe I should have done the easiest thing. I bet by now the farm women would be hard at work, showing their fertility, not trying to build a fucking doomsday device in their backyard!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that&#39;s so fucked up too! I wanted to pick women who&#39;d be independent enough not to take anyone&#39;s bullshit here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And just What do you Think you&#39;re doing?!&#34; I yelled, which made all of them scream. I&#39;d never actually *say* something so one dimensional, but I would put on a show. They need to think I&#39;m the 1st General, Demigod of Decay. Not &#39;just&#39; Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing sir!&#34; Yelled Mary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hear your lie mortal.&#34; I said with a small growl. That was genuine &#34;Stop trying to recreate your world here. In case you didn&#39;t notice, it&#39;s gone because of what you&#39;re trying to recreate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&#34; Mary continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think I don&#39;t have eyes?&#34; I said picking up, and destroying the ball of wires They&#39;d taken the motherboard of some contraption, and taped it all up... Mary was just a mechanic, but she imitated circuitry from memory. It was Wrong, but I still didn&#39;t like this. I let it catch fire in my hand. The wires melted, and she looked defeated. &#34;I cannot express how serious this warning is. This world, just like yours, is unable to sustain that kind of energy. I will do whatever I have to if I find this shit again. That includes being a monster about it if I have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It won&#39;t happen again sir.&#34; Mary said looking down. I could hear her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She will try again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you realize I hear you. I&#39;m taking your hands if you do this again Mary.&#34; I warned. I looked her in the eyes and let her see them burn. &#34;I know you&#39;ve all seen too. I know you all know I would, in fact, shift into a monster and &#39;eat people&#39; as you just thought Hanna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard that?&#34; Asked Hanna, a black haired woman with medium tan skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no reason to lie about it. Your favorite color is an odd one. Burgandy.&#34; I mentioned casually. If I have to prove this, I&#39;m going to get . *real* petty. I was already digging up dirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/There&#39;s no way he can hear thoughts/ Susan, the blonde one thought this so loud if I didn&#39;t see her lips, I&#39;d think she was talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I actually can Susan. I also know you&#39;ve been eating all the Fudge-Um&#39;s before the other girls. That&#39;s why y&#39;all haven&#39;t gotten any Mega Debbies.&#34; I grinned at her scowl. My southern Misura accent came out a second. Gods I sounded country. &#34;Every morning, she wakes up at 5. Stop thinking about it. This is so easy. She steals all the ice cream left by the unicorns too.&#34; I chuckled. &#34;And Amy used Mary&#39;s electric toothbrush to clean a dirty plate this morning. Mary&#39;s taken all the batteries to run the thing I destroyed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why it tasted like ham!&#34; Mary hissed. &#34;You Blown Sprocket!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t change the subject battery swiper! I was still trying to dissect that primitive tech!&#34; Hissed Hanna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before all this Mary was going to just save herself. Lillia before you say anything you were going to &#39;let me have my way with you, even if it&#39;s losing a limb.&#39; You figured a demon wouldn&#39;t want food over sex.&#34; I said this scratching my chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I I NEVER SAID THAT!&#34; Hissed Lillia, the curly brunette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to.&#34; I sang. &#34;But in all seriousness, you&#39;re only half right by the way. Don&#39;t flirt with the supernaturals here. Those that don&#39;t have mates will just use you. Trust me on that. No immortal is getting in a serious relationship with someone who isn&#39;t their mate. You won&#39;t be because you aren&#39;t from this planet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lulliba didn&#39;t even know about that world so they won&#39;t be mates, just toys. If they were a mate, their aging would pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nobody thought that!&#34; Screamed Lillia at the top of her lungs. The little brunette human had some lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s a &#39;slummy&#39; is but nobody cares about race or class. If they did, you&#39;d all be at the bottom.&#34; I said vanishing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the stray thought. Their people classed others by haves and have-nots. Slummies were mortals who were poor, and the serving class. Lillia was apparently a Techi, a middle-class mortal. She wasn&#39;t rich like an Arista, but she liked to pretend she was by buying designer brands and overly expensive luxury goods that she couldn&#39;t afford.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillia was just a spoiled airhead; it was Mary that I began to ponder about. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have brought a mechanic here. If she keeps it up, I&#39;m serious about making the offender an example.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As brutal as I have to be. I don&#39;t care if I have to rip off limbs, or some other on-the-fly, terrible thing, I will. I will without hesitation or remorse either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those women are *my* responsibility Heads will roll if they harm Lia. Most likely mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all screamed at each other, and I let the fur fly. I&#39;d rather they all fall out and hate each other, than do what Mary planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw. She wanted to make a generator from her world. She wanted her commodities back, but we&#39;d already had a discussion about it *before* I brought them here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was strike two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scented Willow at Flora&#39;s when I teleported to the house. By their progress, everything should be renovated soon. her children were playing with mind. Granted they were all huge burly men, but they loved how cute they were. Babysitting my kids is literally pup sitting</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, welcome back Kaizen. I would like to report that there are 3 humans about to be sent to the office if you want to check if they&#39;re hunters.&#34; Said Flora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If they were, Sentinel would&#39;ve texted. I&#39;ll just have him stamp them and let them be on their way.&#34; I said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could do that because the Church enforces their end They uphold their end like supernaturals do, likely half because of Uriel, half because of Rodrick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both those men are admirable, following the tenets of Arviel as they are intended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey dickhead.&#34; Said Willow. She waved at me holding Vex, taking his little paw to &#39;say hi&#39; to his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh gods Fucking damn it&#34; I mumbled. &#34;You didn&#39;t let anyone see did you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? No!&#34; She laughed so hard she had to put our little boy down. She wiped the laughter tear from her eyes. &#34;I did send this to Tyson and Grace though.&#34; She giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? NO!&#34; I screamed at the top of my lungs. It got the attention of the pack, but they knew at least generally why I was so pissed. At least she didn&#39;t show anyone who didn&#39;t see for themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holy shit though I looked at my phone. It was Filled with gifs and memes of floppy wieners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I will *never Fucking EVER* live this down being called a &#39;dickhead&#39; is going to become an inside joke I won&#39;t be able to shake.</p>
