                <p>A/N: FUCK IT I MADE A TWITTER AGAIN! It&#39;s @inuewindwalker and I already uploaded my first post and I actually posted stuff to make myself keep it this time lol</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whiplash of teleportation didn&#39;t change what I knew, it just disoriented me for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They broadcast the destruction like a movie it was projected across Aris&#39;s sky as if it were on a projector, and I saw myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that was part of why he was so upset.. That version of me Wisteria was &#39;just a combination of &#39;features&#39;... That there were many before and after that look like us randomly out there. In the Horned One&#39;s words, he said it is presumptuous and egotistical to think that no one will look like me in other realms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each planet has billions of combinations, and thus there are worlds where even Kaizen has a short, human doppelganger out there. They are just a look alike to them, and nothing else Arviel compared it to owning a blue Nissan, and you notice them everywhere once you buy yours but to my mate it was like killing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen didn&#39;t feel himself, and I *knew* he shouldn&#39;t have done the task he volunteered himself for  I wouldn&#39;t have minded a twin but I know he wouldn&#39;t. The Horned One commented that had he, it would have made much more trouble than it was worth to save her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t elaborate, but he also didn&#39;t need to. I figure since she looks like me, she&#39;d be scared at first, but make trouble with the special treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[BAD PA!] Yelled Vex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awe little ones. Come here.&#34; He called our children, but they wouldn&#39;t budge. They were &#39;protecting&#39; me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That broke his heart too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pups didn&#39;t want him near. They both babbled &#39;bad&#39; at him, and he was as deflated as a popped balloon</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Bad!] yelled Ari. He seemed the most upset about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw everything You look so torn.&#34; I said putting the boys on the floor. They chewed his shoes. They wagged their little tails after a few seconds, forgetting that they were supposed to be &#39;fighting&#39; their father, choosing to play instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I killed a lot of people I know you saw that butI also brought some women back... You saw that too. but it wasn&#39;t to save them eitherI worry because of that. There is no remorse, compassion, or even the desire to care. My actions combined with my mind worry me&#34; He said the last part unable to look at me. He seemed a little broken. &#34;I know you&#39;re going to yell at me, so go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t rightly say I understand; that part of me is intact.&#34; I thought about how to sooth them, putting the rambunctious boys in his armsThey&#39;d temporarily forgot because he got their bottles. &#34;You&#39;re the way you are I think because you HAVE to be How could you follow orders otherwise? You saved those people that you brought too, even if it was for a selfish reason.&#34; I said unsure how I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t the one tasked to make decisions like that or carry out orders of that magnitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate it.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;But I do this for my own selfishness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You aren&#39;t selfish.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He passed me a bottle and a *very ready to eat* Vex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am.&#34; He said Firmly. &#34;I don&#39;t care about what I&#39;ve done, only that I know my home world is safer for it I am useful I am capable I am Decay. I am Rot Willow. That&#39;s what I am: the Demigod of Decay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re Kaizen to me.&#34; I said being farted on by my son! &#34;Vex!&#34; I complained. We both got a good chuckle out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We fed the boys. They happily ate and we did their routine. Kaizen gave them potty time and I bathed them with baby wipes after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence was pleasant. We both got a chance to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought about his actions, and his words. I was told that demigods who get specific jobs are much stronger than just the Child of X,Y, Z It was done as an additional protection, but the tradeoff is that his job is grizzly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Kaizen was doing this to keep Sentinel and his father here for my sake and the Hunters</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve never seen other packs, not yet, but I KNOW they don&#39;t treat hunters like this. I half imagine they keep them in dank dungeons or just kill them and eat them We took the boys downstairs now. They yawned, still thankfully forgetting that they were supposed to be upset with their father&#39;s scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to supervise my decisions.&#34; He said putting the boys on the couch.  They ate pretty fast, and were already asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still felt wrong. He felt like what you&#39;d expect someone with titles regarding Hell would feel like and smell like. Up until this point, he just felt like he was a strong &#39;Old One&#39; as the supernatural people put it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now if someone told me he was a General of Hell, I&#39;d believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They did this to my mate to change him There was peace. There was no reason to toy with us like plastic soldiers in a kid&#39;s playset, but he did need to be prepared to do these kinds of things should he be tasked to again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby I *am* a toy soldier I took my vows and hold my oaths for you and our pups, but there is no excuse for collecting mortals like cattle I look at you, and I see my actions as inhumane.&#34; He said looking toward the window. &#34;I need to speak with Sentinel. I doubt you-&#34; I cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you said you want me to supervise your decisions.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. I feel we should leave the boys here with Flora.&#34; He said trying to pet Vex, and our little boy &#39;bit&#39; him with his no-teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Bad!] He growled. [No!] he yelled a new word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your papa&#39;s fresh from work lil&#39; one.&#34; He said shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got them while they sleepily glared at their father. He went outside likely to sulk about it. I texted her, and Flora came over without any issue. I mean they only needed care every four and a half hours now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d only be gone about an hour, and they&#39;d had everything done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a little time, they will start teething, and I&#39;ll start weening them. I was told that would be in another month or two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was also told they were right on track, and that each pup is different. I wouldn&#39;t worry about it so long as they were healthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got in his car and drove to Sentinel&#39;s office, and he was already at the door, but didn&#39;t seem too perturbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re late.&#34; He said to Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I needed to calm down first. How is it down there?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They have their own homes, jobs, and money. The Misfit Mini-Village will one day be a prosperous town Cull the ghouls Kaizen. Make the town safe enough for them to socialize with other supernatural creatures. It&#39;ll be good for everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t kill them for the audacity of living.&#34; Kaizen said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who cares? They are the *unclean* the accursed damned abandoned, no stolen from the Master. I know that&#39;s a blunt way to put it, but I am here to protect the humans.&#34; Said Sentinel a little pissed, but he didn&#39;t deserve to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His comment pissed me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I&#39;m here for *all* the town&#39;s residents, so I care about ALL within my pack. It defeats the purpose of Misfit to shun the fucking misfits.&#34; Kaizen pointed at him with a clawed finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The only thing stopping them from walking around up here are the brain munchers and blood suckers for Light&#39;s sake. Don&#39;t you wish them free too? They deserve to be free at *all* times, not just from dawn to dusk...&#34; Sentinel growled, but Kaizen&#39;s was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What of your mother?&#34; I blurted a little angrier than I meant to. He glared at me. &#34;I don&#39;t mean that out of spite, but you know I&#39;m right Your words insult her too. Most vampires didn&#39;t choose that fate, and we all KNOW ghouls hate the condition they live in. Those that are here are trying SO hard to fit in too &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right I lost my temper. I hate being stationed here like this.&#34; He said bowing his head to me as an apology, but he should be asking forgiveness to his mother. Good thing she wasn&#39;t here As a mother now... I know that would have *hurt* to hear.</p>
