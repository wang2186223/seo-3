                <p>chapter. I feel like we all have vivid imaginations here . I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll post it. But fuck it was a really fun train of ideas. Long story short, Since Kaizen is a general, he gets to traverse the different Layers unhindered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smell of fresh food woke me up it was only midnight, but I took this time to go ahead and get up ugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mate lay sleeping. With her out like a light, I went downstairs. It was just the Bird King, holding the fire mage he tasked with crystal ball reading in the living room. The poor girl was spent in his arms, though they did not smell of sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was odd for someone like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a bachelor through and through I remember Xaxas used to complain about him breeding with 10 to 15 mortals in one night, male and female, coming to work reeking of wine and fornication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eternya didn&#39;t have a defined sexuality like people do today. Sex was pleasure for him. That was about it. Jerold, I think was like that as well. Ancient peoples, some of them, were loose on sexuality. They didn&#39;t have the concept of homo or heterosexuality. You just had fun, but you also had a wife to keep your bloodline flowing. Powerful men had vast harams, some of witch were for just the entertainment of watching concubines breed, not mating with them themselves Basically for porn before the internet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grin though told me that he heard me and Willow&#39;s &#39;conversation&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was an Awful amount of noise for *just* talking.&#34; Hummed Eternya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh whatever.&#34; I grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had the fire mage in his lap a little closer. He was lent to me, so he was kind of my responsibility Fire witches worshiped his father so It could be that she was a fan, but it was more than likely that she wanted to offer herself to him. I&#39;d confront him about it. I didn&#39;t want him to start thinking it was alright to fuck the whole town He probably could over a few days too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what is this?&#34; I asked with crossed arms. I motioned the mortal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s- I&#34; He paused. &#34;I I don&#39;t know my lord.&#34; He said with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s unlike you to be confused.&#34; I said sitting in a chair adjacent of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mind just keeping her around, sex or not.&#34; He said seriously. &#34;Since I was ordered to &#39;keep it in my pants&#39; I grow fond of *just* this one. Other mortals don&#39;t interest me My gaze does not wonder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held her still, looking down at the little witch. She was younger than me by about 2 decades or so by scentprobably in her 70 or 80&#39;s. She was also objectively pretty. Her fiery red hair and gentle features likely attracted the Bird King&#39;s attention, but her mannerisms softened his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked her up in my phone. There weren&#39;t many fire witches here. She&#39;s in the MoonPack System; everyone in town&#39;s entered in here since they&#39;re my pack. Elinore Flambrand was banished from her people after she refused to take the position of cursed artifact keeper. So she wasn&#39;t a bad witch or anything, at least not on paper but it never hurt to check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you dating?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never dated anyone.&#34; He said knowing what the concept was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you choose to marry, I won&#39;t mind.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was quiet a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My children make too much trouble for the crown master and I don&#39;t want any more. That isn&#39;t fair to a childless mortal so young.&#34; He bowed his head. &#34;If I could just-&#34; I cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eternya, I doubt with you in their life that they&#39;d be a problem.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made fig bars to go with the roast beef.&#34; Said Flora. &#34;Father, you&#39;re Still here? I thought Elinore went home.&#34; She said shaking her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. I guess time slipped through my feathers.&#34; He said looking at the fire mage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lord Kaizen, I humbly ask you to allow my father to marry this woman.&#34; She bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to ask that.&#34; Said Eternya. He looked a little touched she&#39;d do that, and to be fair, I think it was likely the first time I saw her be nice to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already did.&#34; I said getting up. &#34;If you&#39;re really this bothered Eternya, ask my uncle. Eagles mate for life if I remember right.&#34; I said leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw him basically be distraught, but I could understand. He was the 7th General of the Realm King. Eternya was a giant whore, enjoying parties that lasted for weeks on end during the old times, and in the new as well until his eldest daughter was discovered. And also, a traitor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flora was a rebel, and only breathed because she vowed He didn&#39;t want a repeat, but I doubted that would happen. He&#39;d probably be a good father if he knew about his children, and settled down with ONE woman</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your highness, I have fresh beef prepared for you.&#34; Said Flora. She pulled out the roasted meat out the oven. It was still warm. Carrots and potatoes were in there to soak up the fat and juices</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t have to do that, but I know there aren&#39;t any leftovers from dinner.&#34; I said attempting to be as neutral about it as possible. Flora was marked by the Horned One for her children; and I could hear her intentions. She was buttering a wolf up with fresh meat</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well The way it tasted I could see how dogs became a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young master, Sentinel texted that if you don&#39;t come to his summons, that he&#39;s coming here.&#34; Said Eternya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already intended to do that. I have to settle a few things.&#34; I said opening the door and becoming lightning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least with Eternya there, I didn&#39;t mind being a few moments away from Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was waiting for you.&#34; Growled Sentinel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. I got caught up in other affairs.&#34; I said going in. His father was there, looking sternly at me along with Uriel&#39;s wife, Titafia. They were full angels They knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll cut to the chase. This was Contradiction&#39;s resting place. We can&#39;t deal with the corruption alone down there.&#34; Grumbled Tamriel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you have to be such a dick about it though?&#34; I complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because we&#39;d be done and home by now.&#34; He growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is your apartment in Haven that wonderful?&#34; I took point, and we started walking down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said nothing to my rebuttal. His wife was down here, turned, but here on Urth. Everything and everyone he held dear lived in this town Titafia I had no idea about. There was no need for an angel from a different</p>
