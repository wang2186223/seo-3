                <p>chapter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a single gulp of my blood, he fell on his hands and knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifted, looking like. Jerold before passing out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I&#39;ll be damned.&#34; I said looking at the strange pattern of moles on his back. They were three in a row, like the star constellation Orion&#39;s Belt. &#34;He&#39;s the son of the King of Halves.&#34; There was no doubt about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; Asked a wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure. His mortal form&#39;s literally identical.&#34; I said with a firm nod. &#34;Get us some pants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was pale as paper, sporting glittering white hair in his mortal form, while Jerold was much tanner, with brown fur but the eyes were the same so were his features. The King of the Minotaur and other half beasts was homosexual as far as I knew. He had Noah, a mortal soulmate since before I was born This bull had to have been born before that. Cheating on true mates wasn&#39;t possible. There isn&#39;t even an attraction to other people once the bond is initiated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked him up and he had to basically borrow a spare pair of my sweats before I carried him. I slung him over my shoulder. He wasn&#39;t hurt, as his thick neck was already healed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That man&#39;s got some beef.&#34; Joked Warrior McViolet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was getting better at names. He lived about 3 houses down from our packhouse, being a black furred male with green eyes. He stood there in mortal form, being a dark skinned man with straight hair that went to about his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very funny.&#34; I said rolling my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The forest walk was peaceful, and I made my way pass the &#39;hunter&#39; camp. The 3 witches. I believe a total of 8 witches made a Very small coven here, though many of them had different gods that they drew power from. They were growing trees, levitating bullet casings and making it look as if no one was ever there. The tire tracks were also being removed, being covered with fresh growing grass through magical means.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long until you&#39;re done?&#34; I asked casually, not losing my stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, maybe one or two more hours?&#34; Said the one who adorned stereotypical witch clothing. Her hat had her name on it. It was Chelsea. Her blue hair was so electric it nearly glowed, but her smile turned into a huff. She was embarrassed by her mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi baby!&#34; Waved Bob excitedly. He&#39;d sworn to me the first day I arrived in Misfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Working!&#34; Chealsea complained, getting giggles from the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were laughs and spirits were light, but I knew now I had to deal with another King. I&#39;d made his son mine I Knew Jerold. We called him Uncle He couldn&#39;t have known that he had a child running around like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, he adopted Queen Harmony&#39;s mother, Aunt Mini when she was a small pup. Mini grew up with my momHe&#39;s in half of my family&#39;s photos with Noah Queen Harmony calls him grandpa. Jerold loves us, taking us in as his real family He adopts troubled pups from all races, even mortals, and gives them a second chance. Hell, I even encountered a random mortal at a gas station raised by him He wouldn&#39;t abandon a child</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either this bull deserved it, or his mother kept him secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was more than likely the case, since his fur glittered almost like a unicorn&#39;s. Who was his mother? If she just dumped him out in the wilderness, she was likely a shit person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then at the same time, I don&#39;t know the circumstances. Maybe he was kidnapped, he was a prince after all I could hear their links to each other on how serious I looked, but I chose to address it later. I needed answers first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked to town, but I couldn&#39;t&#39; put him in a cell. The humans were in there, but I didn&#39;t want to kill any in case the injured ones got sick. Illness can kill mortals; better we have someone on standby to make sure they&#39;re alright and in the clear, than him shit and eat them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t sure if buying farm raised humans would count seeing as how they&#39;re not made to really know or do anything other than be fodder. They even smell more enticing than normal humans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going boss?&#34; Asked a troll. &#34;I can take him off your hands.&#34; He bowed as I walked past, but I shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got him. He&#39;ll wake up bound to me, so he won&#39;t freak out if I have him.&#34; I said seeing the lights. We were in town in no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, you didn&#39;t kill him?&#34; Asked Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can carry him.&#34; Said Gilbert. They likely sensed the new soul that had been added to grandfather&#39;s fold... the new Warrior bound to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, as I&#39;ve told everyone else. I got it.&#34; I said casualy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a word was really said after that, but I came home to the packhouse dying down. The party was still boisterous, but simmered because many had left. Maybe 60 or so were still in the front and backyard collectively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow was with a bear shifter and her pups on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s that?&#34; Asked the former, unofficial Luna of this place, Falicity. Her daughters, Debbie and Artha were wolf hybrids, as their father was kind of a pseudo-Alpha. No one took the role seriously, but they did work with Tamriel and Sentinel closely. Patrick was a strong gold furred wolf, but of course, the day I arrived, he was smart and surrendered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I rightly don&#39;t know. The minotaur passed out before he could talk, the jail&#39;s full, and I mean to interrogate him a bit. He looks too much like the King of Halves not to.&#34; I said as he groaned in his sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought it best to move him upstairs and he could lay in our office The attic would be converted to the Alpha floor and more rooms, since it was the size of the house like the basement. For now however, it would have to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We gave him blankets and he looked pretty comfortable now I had to send the photo of him to Jerold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone rang Immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s this?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think your son. He was running around in the woods, and I gave him my blood I Can&#39;t tell if he&#39;s mindless I just... kind of defeated him and took the hunters that chased him into custody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Asked Noah. I could hear him in the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think Uncle Jerold has a son.&#34; I said knowing I was on speaker. &#34;Look at the photo I sent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were shuffling sounds, and Noah gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerold spoke in half beast, and Noah was fluent. He knew what his mate said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. I think I&#39;m inclined to agree with you. We&#39;ll catch a flight tonight.&#34; Said Noah. &#34;You broke him.&#34; He said with a huff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You aren&#39;t mad at Uncle Jerold, are you? He passed out before he could talk, but I know this had to have happened before you two were together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that It&#39;s just a little much.&#34; He mumbled. &#34;We&#39;ll be there tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Later Uncle Noah. Don&#39;t let his brain explode before he gets here.&#34; I chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him asleep Jerold&#39;s reaction spoke volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Willow----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was organized Chaos in the office. It was 3pm, and Kaizen was hungover, but being a good sport about it The line was still  out the door, while the man who Kaizen defeated slept still it was like he never had the peace to go before. Maybe that was the case?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pay attention.&#34; Said Kaizen kissing me on the forehead. &#34;So you put in the information here, and then when you press F4, the popup should ask you if you want to print a new ID with the paperwork.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was pretty straightforward, and it kind of reminded me of traditional office work, what I did while I was in school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Identification that was legitimate could be scanned with a little scanner borrowed from the security office, but otherwise, information had to be put in manually. A lot of the supernaturals were older than Kaizen by hundreds of years. Those over a 500 all had vellum, papyrus, or even stone tablet documents mixed in with traditional paper. You could see the progression of record keeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m next.&#34; Beamed Jack with churros &#34;Have one.&#34; He offered, having no documents at all</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He handed us both one and I gingerly took it. To be fair Lunch was on its way via Gilbert, since he offered. We managed to put him in the system and update him. He looked so proud; he even bought a wallet to put it in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack waited so long that he went to the store, got food, and was almost finished. That wasn&#39;t uncommon though. Many people were kind enough to hold someone&#39;s spot, while someone else got food for themselves, and the good Samaritan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll have to handle his. He&#39;s so old, that his files might not pop up. When was the last time you were processed?&#34; Asked Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh, I think 1890? I was arrested, but I&#39;m sure they have it updated since then.&#34; He said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I found it.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;Jack you&#39;re lucky I bound you you&#39;ve killed so many.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OOO, how old am I?!&#34; He asked Excitedly. Those who were already processed were also curious</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was born in BC times Jack predated written history. &#34;It says you were born 15,528 years ago.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to have been an estimate, but then again, I saw the Realm King for myself, met the Horned One, and the Moon Goddess why am I surprised?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Neat.&#34; He beamed. &#34;What&#39;s my body count?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t going to open your criminal records, but now I&#39;m curious too.&#34; Grumbled Kaizen. &#34;What the fuck. I&#39;m not telling you; you&#39;d be Proud of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>5,115,952 deaths 76,504 injuries Maybe he really did kill someone nearly every day. All of those murders were supernatural, about half of which were found outside pack territories. They also counted Roguesthere was a PDF file of victim photos stemming from the early 1900&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack was a problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never had a registered mate Never owned a home. But his original pack was RoyalMoon It meant that he likely originally worked for the original king. I wonder did he just snap, or was he always like that?</p>
