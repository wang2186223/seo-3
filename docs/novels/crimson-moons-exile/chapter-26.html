                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two weeks of peace it was nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was in our bedroom while Kaizen was running around as his wolf out there. He said something about protecting the territory, but it reminded me of real wolves</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got to know many of the werewolves here too, since many of the men sparred to adjust who was in charge of who. It seemed that in their ranks, no one wanted to be at the bottom, yet, any who couldn&#39;t shift automatically were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had delivery cars for any Omega who wanted to risk the human world to pick up deliveries for the gated community, The trade off for the risk, was that even the poor werewolves that came with us, could afford their own things. Kaizen reserved space for people who couldn&#39;t afford an apartment here, but for any who still wanted to make money, they had options.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was currently scrolling on my phone, reading the supernatural internet. Like they had their own WeTube, Dash to your Door, Arrozon, Eboy, and even Etsi. Like I could buy anything from man jerky to magic spellbooks. Watch tutorials on how to bleed and butcher your own human, to how to negotiate with goblins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It bothered me how Easy it was for humans to be bought and sold being &#39;cattle&#39;.. Buying, then locally picking up a &#39;blood slave&#39; with the click of a button gave me a chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me feel watched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swear I could also smell electricity? I looked around to see if any sockets in the wall were messing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get off the internet.&#34; Said Kaizen behind me, and I jumped nearly out my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m putting bells on you!&#34; I yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed. He was completely naked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clothes don&#39;t shift with me.&#34; He said simply. &#34;Stare all you like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wiggled his hips and I got up and pushed him toward the open window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave.&#34; I commanded on deaf ears. He wouldn&#39;t budge, but he did pick me up, letting my legs dangle while he kissed me on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled as he did so, taking my breath away It felt like I was enveloped by tingles and it took away any anger I had at being scared on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I order beef now that I&#39;m able too.&#34; He said kissing me on the forehead. &#34;Plus did you ever consider that Maybe it isn&#39;t a good idea to, you know, Looking up stuff like this if you know will summon me since you&#39;re freaking out?&#34; He asked shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I summoned you?&#34; I said a little sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. You didn&#39;t see the red lightning streak across the sky?&#34; He asked with a raised brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.no.&#34; I said unable to meet his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gods&#34; He facepalmed. &#34;I&#39;m almost done. There was never an Alpha here, and the surrounding forest is fucking ridiculously huge and filled with Rouges of all kinds who don&#39;t want to join the pack; just make trouble.&#34; He said leaving the way he came as red lightning out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok that was kinda cool&#34; I mumbled, taking heed to his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost felt like a little childish kid If they eat people, of Course there&#39;s going to be ways to obtain it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs it seemed like Jack was back, but for him not to be speaking with Kaizen meant that he must have already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good Morning.&#34; He beamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning.&#34; I said seeing him damn near glide across the floor. He walked but I swear there was almost a blur over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something just Wrong with Jack that I didn&#39;t like, but I would be cordial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Fear smells absolutely deli-&#34; He was cut off by my mate bopping him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How he got the newspaper or how he got in here without being lightning was beyond me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For Fuck&#39;s Sake. If you&#39;re going to be weird, come be weird with me.&#34; He complained. His stomach growled. &#34;Damnit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry sir.&#34; Said Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No don&#39;t be sorry, be smarter.&#34; He grumbled. &#34;You can help me secure the border.&#34; He said walking out the door with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OOO Can I-&#34; he was cut off again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Kaizen said a little fed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry!&#34; I yelled as they left out the door. My fear made him use more of his powers and he did look honestly tired from it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be sorry for something natural baby.&#34; He said shaking his head, stopping to turn around to embrace me. He kissed me gently on the forehead. &#34;Can you go buy me some more clothes?&#34; He asked nicely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aright.&#34; I smiled. To be fair, I still hadn&#39;t gotten around to buying stuff for myself either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was put down, and while they were gone, I got my purse upstairs, then I left too. It was nice outside, hoodie weather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun was out, and the people were friendly. I waved, and I believe Kaizen must have sent an escort, because the man who came up to me damn near radiated an off-ness to him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been meaning to talk to you.&#34; Said the large man he seemed almost on par with Kaizen. I knew that with supernatural shifters and such, the bigger someone was, the more important they were. Since he was a similar height, I assumed he was likely a security guard of the community.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes, you peak Quite the interest of my master little one. I am General Tamriel. You must be willow.&#34; He said shaking my wrist. This man looked so fit, he could rip out his officer&#39;s uniform by flexing, but oddly enough he felt. Almost like I&#39;d known him my whole life. Like I could trust him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wrist shake firm, but it felt peaceful. Like I was talking to an angel. He had shimmering golden hair, with golden yellow eyes and well... golden skin too. He looked to be everything Jack wasn&#39;t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile was trustworthy too he practically glowed. Not literally, but if he did I wouldn&#39;t be surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Kaizen-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Rogue had nowhere to go since I grew Tired of chasing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snatched him by the throat. He&#39;d made me so fucking mad I figured out how to teleport, using less energy than I did when I got Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my hand on the top of the mortal&#39;s head, and crushed it with my grip. &#34;You have been given Mercy.&#34; I said looking down at the body. Fucking Trash. In my anger I struck it with lightning. I didn&#39;t care it was a waste of my power. Scum like that deserve worse than what I&#39;d done, send him Straight to Hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Master,&#34; Said Jack. He feared my power. &#34;I mean Alpha.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dragged the Rogue&#39;s body behind me. I was glad I didn&#39;t explode it, but it stunk now of minotaur, burnt meat, and electricity. I saw what it&#39;d done, being a mindless beast, so his actions weren&#39;t his fault but it didn&#39;t make me less angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;t tell Willow that this damn Rogue had killed one of the women that came with us, Harley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The beast preferred the taste of the weak, and prayed on them. He&#39;ll be a good soldier Below, maybe put on the Layer of Aggressionit was ran by Rah&#39;esh&#39;Kraa&#39;Hraa-Zaimaan, a great badger demon, who was so easily angered, that his name made him mad since it took so long to say, and every &#39;r&#39; had to be rolled, and ever &#39;s&#39; had to be hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha that was the last of them.&#34; Pointed Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh they Ran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They saw what I did to the biggest one, but I would check to see if the others were mindless beasts too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They screamed, and if they spoke, I let them run away. If they had no thoughts, or were like cattle, they would be treated as such. All in total, I slayed about 12 of their kind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will allow you lot to graze here, since I know you who still breathe have a mind enough to understand me.&#34; I snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It echoed off the trees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would not allow riffraff to ruin the peace I had here though something told me that it would not last not forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did I think that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sensed that Willow went to bed. So much for the clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the bodies and put them in a big pile. With my powers I created them one by one. It only took about an hour or so. The ashes scattered in the forest, and there was a silent stillness I&#39;d created the birds were afraid of my snarls hunting would not be good today either, as they were spooked. They likely would be the rest of the day. I looked at the sky it was clear and the chill didn&#39;t affect my naked body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34; I said shifting into my true form, running slow so Jack could keep up. Ace, Rick, Yuka and a few others joined. It turned into a spontaneous pack run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Luna would have loved this.] Said Ace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[She&#39;s asleep.] I complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[No I saw her with a guy that looked like Sentinel.] Said Yuka. [I don&#39;t know what kind of creature he is, but he and his friends freak me out.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Sentinel is a half angel but his father is a full one.] I said making a B-line for the security scenter. I doubt he&#39;d be at our small packhouse</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That his father was here meant I was right. I really had gotten Arviel&#39;s attention. I put my mate in Real Danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck.</p>
