                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only darkness, yet I could hear commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Water.&#34; Asked a rasped, pitiful voice. &#34;Anything for a glass. Please.&#34; Someone begged They begged weakly, as if it was all they could do. I felt awful hearing such a sorrowful wail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quite Brutus!&#34; Yelled  I think Noirnamu. &#34;You did not cry out when you poisoned babies in their cribs. You did not lament killing the weak, You have committed so many crimes, your soul should be divvied up in multiple layers.&#34; He hissed. &#34;Beat his maggot-eaten pelt harder. And you will see your folly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will live as every victim. Every crime your hands did, you shall do it to yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;PLEASE!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cries were ignored it seemed that was *worse* than being beaten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to see his marrow by the time I get back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sir.&#34; Said someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I believe that&#39;s the man who weaseled his way into the Royal Wolf Court, and killed kids.. He&#39;s where he belongs. Yet if I didn&#39;t know that, I bet I&#39;d still feel sorry for him I could hear the pops of his lashing from wherever I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Soften his flesh.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;I think I&#39;ll take a tenderloin again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One day yet, I will toss your slimy soul in the Pit Dog. But not today. Not tomorrow. Whenever the masters become tired of you. Use the number 13 on &#39;em.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AH!&#34; yelled Brutus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scream Dog!&#34; He laughed. &#34;Scream enough to hear on Repentance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Legs!&#34; he screamed. They *laughed.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know what layer this was. But I knew I wasn&#39;t &#39;dreaming&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could smell the scent of freshly struck matchesand in the distance I could hear Screams yet. I couldn&#39;t really see anything. It was dark and hot, yet, I followed a pinkish white light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the blink of an eye, I was in front of a hole that I couldn&#39;t see an end too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could not see the bottom of it, nor could I see the other side. As far as the eye could see, was the engulfing blackness of nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apythmenos!&#34; I shouted. &#34;Noirnamu?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh dear, sorry love.&#34; Said Apythmenos. He had a half-eaten leg but I could tell that was the last of that sinner the Pit processes what he eats into energy. &#34;I&#39;ll send you back. I assume you&#39;re here by accident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am.&#34; I said honestly. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s no problem. But this is like my fourth time collecting you. You might want to look into a home stone under your pillow or something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snapped his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a blink, I was in bed, but the yelling of my children made me jump out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MOM-MOM-MOM!&#34; Screamed Vex, but his voice sounded more solid</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;IT FELL OFF!&#34; Screamed Ari, at the Absolute Top of his Lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;re Not Five Yet!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s Wrong!&#34; I yelled teleporting with Kaizen, and we were instantly there to see</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were human shaped now. Gods they were cute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s flesh.&#34; Said Kaizen behind me. &#34;Zeiel&#39;le tek ak layabin nel ef, de na.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me aken me tel de na!&#34; Cried Ari, and Kaizen rolled his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sizi ma nek Na, Zaiseh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok what language was that?&#34; I asked. &#34;..and why did it feel like you said a whole paragraph?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did; that&#39;s Lesser Godspeach. It&#39;s alright boys.&#34; He kneeled to their eye level, and put a clawed hand on each of their heads. &#34;What fine little forms you have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My paws are all floppy. I hate it.&#34; Sniffled Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t either, but when you&#39;re older you&#39;ll thank grandfather for the flesh.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s gonna fall off!&#34; complained Vexoh my gods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wouldn&#39;t want to be only fur when your mate&#39;s flesh, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah&#34; they both more or less said holding hands The ones that touched were a different skin tone from the rest of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were black, not chocolate skin, but demon black... like their grandfather, the Void King. I could see stars on those hands now that I looked a little harder. There was the symbol of the Horned One on the bottom of their left and right palms respectively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am grateful their uncle is the Realm King Had the Light ruled this world I know my boys, my mate, his siblings, nor his father would have held any peace</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s good this world is Sanctuary. Do you remember what I taught you? Nali eh invizoz Nox hana sin ty areh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their father he glowed red, and they three held hands. I didn&#39;t know what he cast, but their hands were the same shade as his. They held rich, but lightly toasted beige complexion, a *little* darker than their grandma, Eclipse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Invizoz.&#34; They both said, and the hands looked normal, but that wasn&#39;t a normal spell That was that language again, godspeach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what did I tell you?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never grab anyone, not even mama with this&#34; Said Ari, holding up his right hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Your hand is a gift Don&#39;t ever lose it, or.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or we lose our powers.&#34; Said Vex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More like, you become half strength until you get it back.&#34; He said with a light smile. &#34;And that will *hurt*.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes papa.&#34; They said at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/They can blow up a state about the size of Rhand Island now./ Linked Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/WHAT?!/ I linked back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Yeah, but that spell not only hides their powers, it also dampens them. I have the keys to the release spell until they turn 20. That&#39;s old enough./</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad. I don&#39;t like this.&#34; Said Vex. &#34;I don&#39;t want to hurt mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held my boys now. &#34;You won&#39;t hurt me. Just be careful, and today you&#39;ll be with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually. They&#39;re with me.&#34; Said Kaizen. It was implied that I was invited, and I took his hand. &#34;Let me teach you both how to visit grandpa again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa says we can come anytime, not just danger!&#34; Said Vex. They held no smiles, being only the wolf until this moment, but they were clearly happy with their tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but he is the King of Hell. We don&#39;t bother Uncle Tyson, so it would also be rude to bother grandpa. Grandma&#39;s fine though. She wants you over.&#34; He shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We ended up in the throne room, and the boys ran straight to Lustrous. He looked exactly like his father, though he was somewhere between his parents&#39; complexion now that I thought of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was a child there who didn&#39;t look like Tyson, Kaizen, Lustros, or my Boys. Not even Grace. He was a miniature Aureus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace actually held Zolotos&#39;s shy hand, but when he figured out those were his cousins, he went to talk with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man stood there in a black suit with gold trim. That had to be the wolf king. He had black hair and Firey eyes, though his expression was like my sons. Neutral, and wolfish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandfather.&#34; Said Kaizen. They pressed foreheads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still remember when you pissed on my shoes.&#34; King Ashital chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were Laughs, even by the Void King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t remember.&#34; Lied my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait are You&#39;re why there&#39;s puppy pads in the queen&#39;s chambers?!&#34; I yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace too. She copied him.&#34; Pointed King Ashital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO I DIDN&#39;T HE PEED TWICE!&#34;  She screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;IT WAS LIKE ONE TIME!&#34; Kaizen complained. &#34;YOU TOTALLY DID! I Remember!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But *you* can&#39;t recall when *you* did it. I call Shenanigans!&#34; Laughed Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut Up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shenanigans!!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Slander!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shenanigans Accepted. Kaizen you&#39;re lying.&#34; Grinned the Horned One. He rested his knuckles on his cheek, being fully entertained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember fondly. There were Three puddles now that I think of it.&#34; King Ashital and the Horned One fist bumped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember watching that.&#34; Laughed the Horned One. &#34;Ah, or when they first found out about shoelaces, then Grace got her head stuck in her father&#39;s boot. I fished you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or when hey chewed through the original throne&#39;s seat cushion, and got lost in the stuffing. Tyson.&#34; Said King Ash with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I DON&#39;T REMEMBER THAT!&#34; Tyson yelled flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We do.&#34; Said the Horned One. &#34;This is amazing. Where are my sons?! Fetch them.&#34; He barked at no one, but I saw the Herold use it as an excuse to go to the human world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or when you used to pull my hair.&#34; Said a beautiful woman with the Moon Goddess That had to be the original Queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember that. All of you, even *you* did that Ash.&#34; She giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King looked a little deflated, while those two chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be honest, I&#39;d seen Queen Gwen, the Soul Mender in many paintings in the castle. She was as tall as Isabelle, Harmony, or Nixxia, however her eyes were an intense silver. They were silver coins with black dots, meaning her wolf&#39;s eyes are black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long, moon colored hair left a trail behind her, past her ankles. It spiraled in a waterfall of fluffy curls that rested overtop a long robe to keep the ends clean It was loose and brushed too. Most royal women would have so much hair in braids, however I wonder was that its own status symbol that it&#39;s SO long, yet managed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\----Kaizen----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xaxashevaal, I choose You!&#34; I pointed at him as if he were a Pikamon, and his sigh had fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not enter my house so Loud little one.&#34; He played Blue Myth Woopkong while holding his mate Who was on her phone. Asanguis silently shot me a glare, though Nixxia was laying on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just a chill morning until I came in here with old memes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re fine. Hey Kaizen.&#34; Harmony waved. I forgot she can hear me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Harmony. My kids got their forms today. The Horned One wants to celebrateThe Pit was *supposed* to come straight here, but he went to the supermarket for a couple trays of sandwiches, cake, and candles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AH!&#34; She screamed, getting off Xaxas to jump up and down with me. &#34;Do they look like Lil yous?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They do.&#34; I beamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me shut this down.&#34; He said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34; Beamed Nixxia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course my love.&#34; Said Asanguis the man&#39;s smooth. I&#39;m surprised of all the horned One&#39;s sons, that he&#39;s not the one with like 19 kids. &#34;Oh whatever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah, you&#39;re the pretty one now.&#34; Said Xaxas. &#34;I need to work on my dad bod.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harmony facepalmed. &#34;Just teleport, you big ham.&#34;</p>
