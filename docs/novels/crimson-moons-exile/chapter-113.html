                <p>Mature</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hardly noticed the tropical beauty and sweet scents in the air the only thing I could really focus on was Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snarled as he held me The motion of his hips made his member graze my button. Each little thump was a request to be invited in And I needed him... I needed him yesterday, but he didn&#39;t realize until I assume right now. My entrance demanded attention I couldn&#39;t help but be almost agitated I was so horny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bet it was this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right.&#34; He grunted. He gyrated his hips. My legs were spread wide on top of him &#34;They call this place The Island of Paradice It was made for relaxation it  enhances emotions. desires.&#34; He ground almost demonically</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you.&#34; I said kissing him passionately It was just hormones But I didn&#39;t care. He held me flexing his claws, almost fighting his true nature as we embraced each other I could understand it Kaizen held back for my sake, but he didn&#39;t understand that I wanted him to unleash is nature.. I wanted it more than just the island&#39;s influence</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It isn&#39;t just that.&#34; He hummed in pure bliss. &#34;You had pups too. I know it takes a while to bounce back from that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; I said with a gasp. His hand grazed in between my legs We were already naked, and he knew I was soaked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kiss we shared was led by me I was hungry for him I wanted him to know it. I kissed him as if he would never see me again. Our tongues danced while the ocean breeze carried my wanting scent. It was almost like a pseudo-heat something the island did to ensure a good time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently picked me up by the waist, and flipped me around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kai-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re literally dripping.&#34; He snarled licking me from my entrance to my button He inserted 2 fingers, and lapped me. I moaned. Kaizen sat cross legged on his shirt, and I was upside down, hung in the air for his wicked desires</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cock was in my face, throbbing to enter me, and I did the closest next best thing. I put it in my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fingered me slowly. The in and out of it matched what I was doing to him. I went down, almost to the base of it, then I swirled my tongue around the tip. I did it so he could feel every ounce of how bad I wanted those fingers to be his member.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pleasure from his slow, confident strokes had me so tight, that his third finger was clamped around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re already stretched enough.&#34; He hissed. I tightened my lips around the head of his cock, sucking hard. I went down slowly, imitating how he mates me.  I took his balls and fondled them a bit at the same time, and he put his tongue on my button adding a 4th finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel myself tighten, since I was now climbing to an orgasm I know will have me seeing stars. He knew how to make me hum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you in me.&#34; I said with a whine, and he stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to do it.&#34; He said gently flipping me around. &#34;Your Alpha wants his Luna to ride him.&#34; With the snap of his fingers, a condom was in his hands, and he put it on in one swift motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then your Luna Accepts.&#34; I said doing it slowlyI hissed in bliss I still stretched around him Kaizen&#39;s massive member could be used as a club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Shut Up!&#34; I laughed with him. I was flustered that he heard me, but it didn&#39;t stop me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held my sides, but he didn&#39;t keep any pace. He let me do that. He supported me as I bounced up and down deliberately slow I hadn&#39;t had sex in months, and he was so big, that for a moment, it felt myself stretch  I bit my bottom lip so I didn&#39;t growl</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to hear it.&#34; He encouraged. &#34;Nobody&#39;s going to be here until sunset scream as loud as you like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was slowly lifted, almost enough for him to leave my insides. Only to be slowly, but forcefully pushed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it.&#34; He said doing it again. I stretched around him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That singular moment gave me pleasure I&#39;ve never experienced  I don&#39;t know how Maybe I forgot how good it felt? Each dip, I was completely filled. He hit the back of my entrance and every exit, I needed it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The steadiness sped up, but he used all the strength he had to be still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck me Kaizen.&#34; I said throwing my head back. I felt his cock throb for more. He clawed the sand a second, enough that I knew he held fistfuls in each one.  I moaned It sounded almost desperate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t.&#34; He admitted. &#34;The only thing I want to do is spread your legs wide, and fuck you standing.&#34; He snarled. The rumble made me melt It was so dominant. I almost felt like I&#39;d been ordered to be drilled by him. I could feel his claws flex when he he/d my sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want that.&#34; I said coming down hard on his cock and he gripped my sides a little harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; You sure you can handle it?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m wet enough.&#34; I said kissing him roughly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He only needed a single hand to get off the ground. He held me in the air, and I grabbed the fence. He intended on fucking me with all the force he could give, and I wanted every inch of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the first pump, he broke the fence, and I finally got what I wanted. I held the wood while I was leaned forward, prostrated before my mate My hands were buried in the sandy grass</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still held onto the wood while he had my hips at his standing level... I could see the ocean as he made rough, unrelenting love to me. He was fast and feral  The slaps were probably heard over the entire island, but I didn&#39;t care. Like he said, only the two of us were here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck.&#34; He growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harder.&#34; I cried. He rammed into me, and bit my mark. He snarled as he did so. Him leaned over as he still held me was something we had to try at the packhouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah! Yes!&#34; I screamed. The pain of the mark became drumbeats of pleasure... each wave after wave sent me closer It lapped me like the ocean, and hit me with the force of a demigod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled my hair so he had better grip, and he fucked me so hard that I broke the wood in my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More!&#34; I whined. The only thing I could do was sound like a whore. I was a whore today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swear he got bigger too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He filled me full with his cock I was stretched out by my mate; my legs were wide in my deep lean He wanted all of my entrance, and he took it like a wild, insatiable animal that had been starved for months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It slammed into me, each time getting me closer How did I want *more*? How could he give more.?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah.&#34; He grunted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Faster.&#34; I begged That&#39;s how it came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got faster by my request, and I was getting tighter. My breasts bounced like no tomorrow, and he let go of my hair, to put both hands on my sides The mark bite radiated with only pleasure I could feel not only my arousal, but his too. It added an additional layer to our hot, spontaneous sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He roared thrusting into me so roughly that I came with an explosion. I didn&#39;t climb the mountain this time, I was thrown off it. He still thrusted with the might of a demigod, and came so hard that I could feel each pulse. Cum dripped out of me, and I panted, while he held me. He snarled one last time, pulling out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He broke that condom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. &#34;Well I guess we&#39;re having more twins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do NOT joke like that!&#34; I laughed with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There goes the deposit too.&#34; He chuckled, slapping my butt. He had to catch me, because I won&#39;t lie, I would have fallen over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh stop!&#34; I complained playfully. I held his hand, and I dragged him to the ocean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He silently followed, and when we got in, I put my hands around his cock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; He asked curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were bigger I know you were.&#34; I said stroking it. I wanted to go again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed to go again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. You were so tight. It&#39;s a shame I can&#39;t keep-&#34; I cut him off by getting closer. We were deep enough in the water that when he held me to his chest, the water still covered our privates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to Fuck me until *you&#39;re* tired Kaizen.&#34; I said seductively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Ma&#39;am&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he put himself back inside me He was still hard, and I was still wet. We both moaned, as this time I bit his mark. He had his head thrown back while this time he held my legs, spreading them wide while we mated in the surf. My ankles rested on his shoulders, and he massaged his cock over my button, making a swirl motion with each entrance</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snarled in my ear, and I could feel the hot breaths he took, almost as if he were breathing fire. My eyes were strained shut with the thrusts of my mate. Each one was its own orchestra of pleasure Each one was meat with a moan from either of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not stopping until sundown.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please do.&#34; I said letting go of his mark, if only to notice that it pulsed red a few times.</p>
