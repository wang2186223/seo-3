                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father in law sat in my rocking chair. It was just a cheap wooden one from Arrowzon, but it was made for shifters. I sat on the bed next to my little ones, and I broke the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for helping me.&#34; I said rubbing Aristaeus one last time between his little horn nubs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anytime. Family is important to wolves.  But since all this started, I barely feel like a werewolf anymore.&#34; He said looking out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s important to everyone and I especially want to thank you for letting me see my family.&#34; I said quietly. He smiled softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xaxas does not know what it&#39;s like to be mortal. He doesn&#39;t need food, air, water, not even sleep. He doesn&#39;t really know what pain is, or how it works. It&#39;s an inconvenience for him . &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; I asked. Bryson nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Experiencing those things is kind of like a novelty, or party trick for Xaxas. He was born knowing who he was and his purpose I ran around the woods as a nuisance youth, then later a Rogueeven a prisoner. I Know what it is like to be tired, sick, poisoned, hungry, cold He would not help you. I could not stand there and see you so upset. You&#39;re my pup too.&#34; He admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t surprised on knowing that about his brother, but I was surprised that he shared. Bryson was a man of few words, and mighty actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to say anything. I know you&#39;re pretty tongue-tied at the moment.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;Are you still in pain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still feel the incision from time to time.&#34; I admitted. &#34;Nothing like the first few days, but I was told to take it easy, be careful shifting, and not to exercise or lift anything heavy for a while. It&#39;s physically healed, but still sore, and will be a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded firmly. &#34;The reason you fair better than Isabelle did, was because you were monitored, and when something went wrong, my father was there already&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did people not want to summon him or something? When he appears he poses as a doctor.&#34; I said not trying to give too much away in case he wasn&#39;t supposed to know either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye. People they have a hard time trusting us, you may see soon enough.&#34; He said cryptically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was taught all things dark were evil, and not to trust the Horned One&#39;s children. All I&#39;ve seen though is that looks are deceiving.&#34; I said truthfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are, but that&#39;s also Good advice for a human. All who are not marked, my father does not care for and demons love their work.&#34; He warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One very light tap was on the threshold of the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Master.&#34; Waved Eternya. &#34;It&#39;s important.&#34; He whisper-yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax; I need to go check something.&#34; Bryson said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can do that.&#34; I pointed to Eternya, who kept waving at him at the threshold of the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. They just found a rat in the woods.&#34; Bryson said leaving with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Eternya-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want a report Eternya.&#34; Said the youngest master. Lord Bryson was just as impatient as his older brother with about the same amount of bloodthirst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The town is secure, and I have the priest alive, in the basement.&#34; I motioned him to follow me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated to put him down there were the lower ranked wolves slept, but I had no choice. I am tasked with watching one of the master&#39;s females. It would be unwise to leave with her so injured, and her babes without teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For fuck&#39;s sake. Get away from him.&#34; I growled at the curious teens who were asking him questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry!&#34; They shouted running off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had the old man not been bound, I had no doubt that all of them would be dead. His mouth was bound so he could not shout cantrips, his hands were bound AND separated, a detail most forget. Holy magic can call upon the flame of the sun, and had his hands been together, if his faith was strong enough, even iron chains would be melted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This priest had an X on his neck, but that didn&#39;t mean his god abandoned him after the church did. Excommunicado was stamped into his neck with that X, but he still smelled holy. He was about as olive skinned as me, with silver hair. He looked I think 80, maybe 90. He was covered in liver spots and his eyes were cataracted</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bet in his youth, this one was a fine soldier of the light, but now in his time of old age, they abandoned him. I would gain any information I could. The pups who lived in the basement they will have to sleep on the couch tonight. I already put some plastic on the floor to keep the rugs clean. I&#39;m sure Lord Kaizen would probably chew me out if I ruined anything here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mortal you will be given a chance because torturing you will be delicate and tedious. Why are you here?&#34; I barked. I was going to start with toes, but his majesty held up his left hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not harm the human.&#34; Said Lord Bryson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bowed. &#34;I overstep. He is your kill my lord.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. What did I find?&#34; Asked the mortal. &#34;What did I find so important, that the Bird King is here and who are You for him to submit to you?&#34; He asked Lord Bryson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The father of the Alpha you found.&#34; Said Lord Bryson. I was surprised he&#39;d say anything the young master, or the old master especially would have skinned him alive for such a tone. It angered me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I ask you one more time; What are you doing here?&#34; I demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eternya, have a seat over there. You&#39;re too amped.&#34; He commanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a bow I reluctantly sat my wife must have known I was down here. She was the one who saw him as she rode her broom She silently hugged my neck, and I kissed her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about we start like this.&#34; Bryson got a small chair, and it creaked under his stature. &#34;I am Bryson, last born of the Horned One. Who are you?&#34; He asked patiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Terry Fisher, former XII Sect Hunter, Excommunicado. My crime was killing the unclean.&#34; He grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Unclean?&#34; Repeated Lord Bryson. I knew what those were supernatural creatures They often called those of demon blood unclean  Something told me he wasn&#39;t referring to that though</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The children of my Lord who do not kneel. They play with magic, or worse, they cavort with the damned. One such soul is here. I was attracted to the presence of such a soul, as well as my people who are imprisoned.. There is no bounty for this one, nor was there one for the last harlot I encountered. They punished me. They are Blind.&#34; He hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you&#39;re one of *those*.&#34; said Lord Bryson. &#34;You disobey, then whine like a kicked dog for biting the hand that feeds you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not Bite! I Aide!&#34; He yelled. &#34;I know you are a Devil. If I wasn&#39;t bound, If I were younger, I&#39;d have killed you lot already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think the church would want this one back to burn themselves?&#34; Asked Lord Bryson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll fetch Sentinel my lord.&#34; Bowed Elinore. I watched her ass as she went up the stairs. When I get off work, I&#39;m taking her to the movies or something. Maybe buy her a fluffy bear toy and flowers. Girls like those.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It only took about 5 minutes, and Sentinel looked stern. His wings were out, and the priest thought he was saved, however, we in the room knew he wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was flying over the house.&#34; Said Elinore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well yeah, I don&#39;t want to make friction. I sensed the Priest.&#34; Sentinel took one look at him, and the half angel sneered. &#34;You disobey the master.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The master taught us to-&#34; The former Priest was cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take him to the Ring.&#34; Said Sentinel. He grabbed the chair. He began to drag it up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? NO!&#34; Yelled the priest. His heartbeat out his chest. &#34;They&#39;re monsters! Are you not one of the Lord&#39;s chosen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am, though you are a fool. We were told to leave the innocent be, and you can&#39;t leave well enough alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do the work.&#34; The Priest said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Wrong work.&#34; Scoffed Sentinel. &#34;Lord of Justice you may relax. He got past me because I expected him to come to the office, not linger in the woods.&#34; He bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lord Bryson nodded. &#34;I understand. You think you do good, thinking all of us are evil. Just as all of you aren&#39;t &#39;good&#39;, we aren&#39;t all &#39;evil&#39;. But this is Sanctuary now. Your actions are prohibited. Good job Eternya, Elinore.&#34; Said Lord Bryson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been acknowledged.. Me and my wife bowed.  &#34;Anytime sir.&#34; I said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all heard the decree from the old master. The Horned One does not want Priest&#39;s blood on our hands, and the Church is at least somewhat serious if they kicked him out for this. They cannot just raze supernatural dens to the ground anymore, just as I cannot burn cities, or harm humans in general</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The law was kept on both ends. I think in all my years, that was the thing that surprised me.</p>
