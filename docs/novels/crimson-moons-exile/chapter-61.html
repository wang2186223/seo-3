                <p>.. Somone Has to have a *real* funny sense of humor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just really *really* funny. I thought this to myself silently since me and Tyson drew straws to see who would ride with Herculian, and Diana. Grace and Aureus already left, saying that he didn&#39;t care if his car was destroyed in the battle, that he&#39;d just buy three more. Better to lose a car than his temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Why don&#39;t you just drive your own car?/ Linked Tyson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Look at their smug ass face and tell me that Diana won&#39;t talk shit about us the entire way./</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/You don&#39;t want to get your car &#39;hurt&#39;, don&#39;t you?/ he grinned arrogantly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/That was the first car I ever bought! It&#39;ll be a classic one day./ I growled the link, but he laughed!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Oh my gods. If you&#39;re willing to deal with *them* I won&#39;t stop you. I thought you weren&#39;t actually serious. I&#39;m off with Uncle And some of his Royal Guard./ he outwardly snickered, while Jerald looked pretty stern about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You aren&#39;t a king. You don&#39;t have to come Kaizen.&#34; Said Jerold, putting his hands on my shoulders like dad doesHonestly, I wanted the Hellcat to be here because I gave Jack permission to get them out of here should Misfit be a target</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Want to because he hurt my mate on my own territory. He killed both my Uncles like a Snake so he could try to take me, and Ran like a Rat when he couldn&#39;t&#34; I said getting my bags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a small train of us in Wix&#39;s rental cars. They were heavily insured, and in the event of their destruction, he&#39;d make double the money he spent on them. It was why he was so pushy about it in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I won&#39;t stop you either. Noah, Samira, and Willow are here. The Wolf, as well as the Half-beast Royal Guard are here. And honestly with Jack here, only an Old One who hasn&#39;t encountered him would try him.&#34; Uncle Jerold said with the slightest smile. He left to give goodbyes to his mate, which left me no more stalling excuses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wonder what stories Uncle had of Jack. I could only guess since he was once a friend of the Sleeping Wolf King, that grandfather had him in his war band, until he likely killed pack or the innocent maybe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh this could be fun.&#34; Said Dianna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;ll ride too.&#34; Said Rodrick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awe boo.&#34; She huffed playfully, but her voice pissed me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I silently put my things in the trunk, and went to my mate, who hadn&#39;t said anything this entire time. She was against me going, but didn&#39;t want to stop me She thought herself selfish; that I shouldn&#39;t trade the world for her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went to kiss her gently on the lips. &#34;I&#39;ll be back. If you asked I would trade this world for you; you know that.&#34; I said feeling her little tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! I won&#39;t say that. You and the Kings will be the only ones who can stop this. I heard your meeting; I Know how bad this is. I saw the news too. The Great Deserts all over the world are flooding, yet no plants can grow. The trees shed their leaves early, and healthy fruit trees and crops are going dormant before they go to seed as if they&#39;re sick Look at the grass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped her with one more kiss, and I had to kneel to her eye level to press my forehead to hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;ShhI know the world dies I feel that I will see you soon my mate.&#34; I said hugging her, rubbing my scent on her shirt. She&#39;d need that if I was gone as long as I think I might be. We have to hunt him down And fight him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still heading west, into Californya</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you.&#34; She said in tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you too.&#34; I said giving her one last touch. I patted her hair, and if I didn&#39;t turn around, and put in headphones, I might have stayed. Those little eyes of hers wet with tears was dangerous. The loudness usually hurt my ears no matter how low I set them to be honestbut I&#39;d rather listen to mortal news and WeTube Shorts than deal with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat in the back with the Man King, while Dianna sat in the passenger side, holding Herculian&#39;s hand. She looked pretty jealous at us so in love, but all that was her fault. If she wasn&#39;t a piece of shit, grandmother might have given her Jerold, not go so far as to negotiate with Arviel While Still Imprisoned, collecting Noah for the Battle Bull&#39;s mate, because he was a better match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They said nothing to me, as they likely knew that my headphones were blocking the sound. I also had nothing to say to them. Should they start talking, I would turn it down to listen. However, if it wasn&#39;t business, I wouldn&#39;t contribute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This went on for two hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news was bad. It reminded me of when I was in my 20&#39;s, and Uncle Xaxas dealt with the first wave of Old Ones who woke, but didn&#39;t want to conform to his newer, more peaceful laws Some countries saw it as an opportunity to blame their enemies, while others cried the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Holy Seat held mass to pray to the Lord of Light, that he has mercy on them. Since Arviel made men, about 75% of all humans either had Arviel directly as their main worship, or some variation that was still him, just maybe another name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some worshiped the entire pantheon, while some only him, or others a combination of both him and Lia. Regardless, the Holy Seat&#39;s job was to be a human head all could look too, and find comfort. None of them knew of the Man King, who refused to ever take the position. The other 25% are mostly worshipers of some god in Arviel&#39;s good grace, as only recently have beings been allowed to worship the Horned One and celebrate Lunarween</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before that, you&#39;d end up on the Ring, burned at the stake for even the utterance of the Horned One&#39;s name in the wrong place, or at the very least tortured. Humans today have no idea the atrocities committed to keeping them safe from themselves, not just us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then my signal went to one bar, as if my patience was being tested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You alight?&#34; Asked Rodrick. I didn&#39;t really hear him, but he did poke me a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took out my headphones. You&#39;d think a creature of the night would be stuffy against the church, but he&#39;d done no wrong to me or mine, well not recently. I&#39;m sure he&#39;d done something being so old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine Father Rodrick.&#34; I lied, he chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, listening to Confession for multiple lifetimes makes me pretty good at seeing you&#39;re Not. You&#39;re mate&#39;s fine.&#34; He said kindly. He was extending a proverbial olive-apple, and I took it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know; I&#39;m just still pissed for my uncle&#39;s sake.&#34; I admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that.&#34; He said shaking his head. &#34;Diana, you are-&#34; She cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I *KNOW* I fucked up.&#34; She said looking at us from the front seat. &#34;Back then I was hurt because I lost my husband. Then I had Jerold He was never meant to fall in love with me I was never meant to get pregnant.&#34; She grumbled. &#34;I did have *some* feelings for him, but after my husband died, I walled that part of myself off&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yet, when both those things happened, you should have been an adult.&#34; Said Rodrick. &#34;I&#39;ve lived and died many times I must admit the first few I might not have been the best man, but I was a father for my children .and if you couldn&#39;t have been a mother, better he had been in Jerold&#39;s arms, or his grandmother&#39;s than in a field somewhere because you didn&#39;t want the responsibility. You don&#39;t even have to love your son, but if he seeks closure, it will be your job to give it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that too!&#34; She said a little spent &#34;I can&#39;t lie and say I was young, or that I didn&#39;t know that I was thinking. I am a Fae. We don&#39;t &#39;love&#39; so instantly. You wolves and mortals, your hearts pour out kindness and attachment as if it&#39;s free. For us, it costs. Our bonds are marriage, and our children may slit our throats. We don&#39;t invest time in children we know won&#39;t thrive. We don&#39;t love our husbands I can&#39;t even rightly say I know what it is. When I see Jerold, I feel. Anger why am I saying this? Are you putting your magic on me?&#34; She snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. You only speak your truth.&#34; Said Rodrick. &#34;You hurt, you forced yourself to see Jerold and your son as how you saw your husband, or other connections. Fae are a selfish lot, but you are the most. It is your nature, as it is mine to heal others, regardless of how I feel about them personally.&#34; Rodrick said shaking his head. &#34;The bonds you broke will never be mended, but maybe there might be room for forgiveness if you stop lashing out at them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s right.&#34; Said Herculian. &#34;Ironic that you say that, when your &#39;master&#39; abandoned me too, yet I forgave him and Lia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We who live forever don&#39;t get the luxury to hold grudges, especially beings we Have to work with.&#34; Said Rodrick. &#34;But that doesn&#39;t mean you ever forget. Listen to Hurculian. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m driving to go save the goddess who sent vipers to my mother&#39;s bed, making me an orphan during the old times. I heard the Pit took in the daughter of Tillik, a wolf, yet I, the son of the Sun God himself was forced to be a slave and eat pottage until one day I discovered my power, and took my freedom for myself  Not Once did my father help me, not once, yet he asks me to save this world again.and Lia begs my forgiveness as Diana does her son. Alavastros was Lucky to be in the forest, with spirits as a mindless half beast his fate would have been far worse should humans have found him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember that life. I was the one who found you after and made you a soldier.&#34; Said Rodrick. &#34;I wasn&#39;t easy on you either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No but it made me a man, not a rightfully grudge holding demigod... I love my little fairy too much to see her and Lia in the same light though.&#34; admitted Herculian. &#34;and It Irks Me Greatly that you already hate me so much Lord Kaizen, Son of Birrai&#39;shivaal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did this become a pity contest?&#34; I complained. &#34;I refuse to feel sorry for any of you fuckers.&#34;</p>
