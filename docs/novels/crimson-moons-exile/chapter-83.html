                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s see.&#34; I said looking in the backseat of Kaizen&#39;s Hellcat. Me and Eternya stuffed it as full as we could get, but to be fair, we&#39;d have to do at least two trips. We were in front of the general store, but I could see curious wolves likely about to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you insist on not nursing, at least get a breast pump.&#34; He said thinking out loud. &#34;If your pups are born in fur, we might need to stop by a human pet store to get the right kind of bottles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really did your research.&#34; I said being helped with a stroller. It was on sale, so I got it for later. The big box wouldn&#39;t Fit, but we smashed it a little to force it in the backseat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did. Hopefully I might be of use when they&#39;re born.&#34; He admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna, do you mind if we help?&#34; Asked a buzzcut warrior in officer&#39;s uniform. He stood next to his partner, who also smelled like his mate. His long-haired mate was stockier He had to be the stronger of the two, since he let it hang off the top middle of his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. The nursery is in between our room and Eternya&#39;s.&#34; I said handing them the keys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The buzzcut warrior rolled down the window to drive, while his mate got a black Charger labeled &#39;Misfit Pack Patrol: Unit 12&#39; on it. The patrol car held the rest of my items, and I didn&#39;t mind this nice weather. I&#39;d wait until they came back to go home temporarily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a separation when it came to the Warrior division. Pack Patrol delt with the streets; they wore uniforms because most days, they didn&#39;t have to shift most of the time. They deal with pack disruptions and disputes, whereas the Border Patrol Units were usually in worn clothes they didn&#39;t mind shifting into, because they fought on the borders with Rogues of all kinds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since there were so many different kinds of peoples here, there were different kinds of Rogues attracted</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You&#39;d think with Eternya&#39;s aura, as well as Tamriel and Sentinel&#39;s presence here that no one would dare, but apparently, I was wrong I think I should-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard that. No.&#34; Said Eternya firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Hellcat was brought back empty, and he opened the door for me. I sat in the passenger side, and I kind of wondered when he learned to drive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to speak with Sentinel; I don&#39;t know why, but I have a feeling that I need to.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That feeling is your instincts. He&#39;s a threat and you want it dealt with. That&#39;s something for me to do.&#34; He said pulling off. The drive from the store was only about 6 minutes tops.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright Kaizen&#39;s been gone three hours, so I bet when he gets back he&#39;ll be tired.&#34; I said thinking out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I doubt that.&#34; He grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I asked as he pulled into the driveway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s been years without the touch of a woman. Even if he is tired, he&#39;ll make time for you.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t think of it that way.&#34; I said this getting out the car myself. I thanked Eternya, and went upstairs. Valery was with her baby, arranging where the baby stuff went. She stayed in a packhouse room, and her sons shared one, even though technically only officers were allowed to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was another house bought for Omegas, and those who couldn&#39;t afford a home here, but it was still being renovated. She&#39;d told me she&#39;d move out of principle, but I didn&#39;t want that I would respect her wishes though. It&#39;s her life, and me saying anything might make her do as I &#39;command&#39;, rather than what she wants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi Luna.&#34; She beamed. &#34;I think the bars to the crib might be alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rick was putting it together, while Jack helped put some spare furniture in the attic. I may have also bought twin beds so that they could each have their own section of the room. I also tried to think of everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t get my hand through the slats, so I think it&#39;ll be fine.&#34; Said Rick. &#34;I&#39;ll set up the changing station next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Valery, can I talk to you?&#34; I asked, and she nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course!&#34; She smiled. She seemed so much happier here &#34;I was going to go get a bite to eat while my oldest watches the little ones. Want to join?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That sounds nice.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We went downstairs, and she had her own minivan now. It took her all of 2 seconds to put the baby in her seat. &#34;Jack said I could use his car whenever I need.&#34; She smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow. I didn&#39;t know he had a minivan.&#34; I giggled. &#34;I half expected him to have a cooler car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did too.&#34; Valery said turning the ignition. Once she pulled off, she put her hand on my shoulder. &#34;Now Luna, tell me of your troubles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so nervous.&#34; I admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have every right to be. You&#39;re going to be a fine mother too.&#34; She smiled. &#34;I know you were human, and all this is still new. I couldn&#39;t imagine.&#34; She mumbled. &#34;But we all have faith that you and Alpha will be good parents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; I said looking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wasn&#39;t what I wanted to talk about well not completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you raise your kids?&#34; I asked. Her sleeping pup was in the car seat Her little girl was so small maybe 5 or 6 pounds &#34;Silvia&#39;s so tiny, but one day she&#39;ll grow up and be stronger than you...&#34; I said looking at her hair. It was silver as a coin, but the tips were black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had my pup at 5 months, so she&#39;s going to be small. We shift and birth by the Lady&#39;s grace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-&#34; She cut me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s simple. You talk to them. You guide them when their young, and teach them proper outlets for their powers My sons and daughters are all gifted. Even when they were small, my boys were strong enough to hurt someone like me... So, I taught them young to be gentle. I teach them to use their words first, and to Never lay hands on an Omega.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s my real worry I don&#39;t want our kids to be sadistic monsters.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry so much.&#34; She said happily. &#34;Lord Kaizen is a good man He wouldn&#39;t allow that. I suspect all that doubt is coming from you going in circles in your mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re exactly right&#34; I said relenting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she pulled into the café, I took the baby out the seat for her so she could parallel park a little straighter I smelled how new she was to the world.I handed her baby back, but I almost didn&#39;t want to. Silvia was so small and pink I could bet that was also instinctual. That innate desire to adopt that child</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The café had been renovated. It seemed more modern, with wooden tables and chairs that reminded me of BuckStars back home. The clerk even wore a green apron, though their label and knockoff logo read Misfit. It was also busy in there, with many people of all classes inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Misfit wasn&#39;t just for the elite anymore, and more homes were being made. There was also more forest bought to accommodate the change too. Many from all over the world wanted to stay here, under a neutral king, and two generals. Eternya said he&#39;d buy a home after our little ones were around 15 or so, so that if he does stay here, that he can still be around, but have his own space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment we walked in, the clerk stopped ringing up the next customer. He was tall, though his eye flash made his eyes milky I think he was an Omega like Valery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your highness, what would you like?&#34; Asked the clerk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want a cheeseburger and a chocolate milkshake.&#34; I said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have a seat. We&#39;ll bring it to you.&#34; Said the clerk with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were honestly more like a diner than a café in that regard, but I wasn&#39;t complaining. He didn&#39;t ring it up or anything The guys in the kitchen just started making my order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We made no protest, and sat by a window. We got stares and looks, but mostly bows. People knew who I was, and no one wanted to get in the way. I could see her eyes turn milky a moment, and she sighed. She linked back that person, and face palmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My oldest, Tommy, is watching my other pups. He&#39;s 17, and they&#39;re at the park.&#34; She said rolling her eyes. &#34;He got into a bit of a scuffle with one of the  more well off pups, but thankfully Yuka was out on patrol with his mate, the ice mage Inka.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34; I said sitting up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wondered why they waited so long to have pups too If I remember right, Valery was over 800 That age likely had something to do with it. I asked her once did she remember the Witch Trials. If she had normal children, ones who could shift, I&#39;m sure she got to see them put on the Ring. And her mate was a runner for her old pack. He likely died doing his job, and they didn&#39;t help her at all</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was only a guess. It could also be that she just waited. Or wasn&#39;t able to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I wouldn&#39;t ask about something like that on such a nice day. She was smiling, her little baby was in her arms, and we&#39;re out having a good day. Bringing all that up would probably make her upset. I outwardly smiled and we kept the conversation light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On the house.&#34; Said one of the cooks. He wanted to present it to me himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t this better?&#34; She said happily after I hummed with that first bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is thank you. I&#39;ve been thinking about all the what ifs. It&#39;s nice to stop.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a flash of red in the sky, along with the boom of thunder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Kaizen. I knew that instantly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recognized that red lightning from anywhere. He looked like he was coming from the packhouse by the direction. He landed at the door, and opened it with clawed fingers. He felt different. There was a small danger to his aura, and his glare before he saw me was razer sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There you are.&#34; His gaze instantly softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did everything go?&#34; I asked, but instead of responding right away, he came over and kissed me on the forehead</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything is settled.&#34; He smiled. &#34;Our pups are safe It&#39;s my job to handle all the supernatural stuff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was relieved I tried holding it in, but I cried on his shoulders. I hugged him, and I hated that I broke down so easily. I won&#39;t blame it on hormones, because it wasn&#39;t. It was relief that they wouldn&#39;t be born to have some terrible fate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be on my way your highness.&#34; Said Valery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for consoling my mate. You don&#39;t have to leave if you don&#39;t want.&#34; He said seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do sir.&#34; She said looking at the table. Kaizen was all I could scent, but I could tell he made her submit without trying to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then go ahead. I&#39;ll take Willow home.&#34; He said this kindly, but it was silent the moment others saw him. He was my mate. Whatever happened, however his aura affected others wouldn&#39;t do that to me. And if it did, the gentle kiss he gave would have taken it away. He was always so passionate I felt calm despite his new scent.</p>
