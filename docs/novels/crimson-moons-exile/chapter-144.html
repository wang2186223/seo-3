                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Announcing Prince Kaizen, Brother of the King.&#34; Said Mr. Julian, the head omega servant. I asked them not to do all the titles If they had to say mine, my mate, AND my kids, just that would have us here all day. That isn&#39;t even including everyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment our feet hit the marble floors of the throne room, the boys squirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lustwros!&#34; Screamed Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;ZoWroTos!&#34; yelled Vex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AriSStaous!&#34; Shouted Zolotos, hissing his &#39;s&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vexstwrios!&#34; yelled my little nephew Lustros, and honestly it was cute as fuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow put them down and they slid in place a second before they ran full speed across the throne room. Zolotos flapped with all his little might, not getting very far off the ground. The four . They *immediately* started biting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh gods damn it.&#34; Said Tyson with a smile. &#34;I&#39;m replacing the floors with fucking black granite if it cracks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Already ordered sir.&#34; Said Ronitus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All 4 basically heated the floor enough to crack it Right after the Second ordered so much stone Father&#39;s quarry is going to make millions this year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought this was going to be some kind of wholesome thing or something, but then I remember how much fun it was to get Grace or Tyson to tattle on me for pulling their ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good Kaizen&#39;s paying.&#34; Said Tyson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha, ha, King of the Wolves.&#34; I rolled my eyes. &#34;The floor&#39;s already broke; want to help the mortals take it up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34; In an instant he summoned his sword, and the pups ran to their mothers. They wagged their little tails, knowing that we were only playing too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both teleported to the center, and sparred probably faster than the Omegas and Council could see. I know I was wrong to do it, but I did give him a good smack in the neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You Bitch!&#34; Tyson laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bad!&#34; Said Vex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oooo bad word.&#34; Said Lustros. My nephew barked at his papa until we stopped our spar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry son.&#34; He said sheepishly, and there were chuckles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyson teleported again. He was *fast* but I was *faster*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hits harder though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You play too much!&#34; I growled when he bonked me on the head with the flat of his sword, It made a bit of a shockwave under our feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve bopped me like three times harder than that!&#34; he complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you&#39;re hitting too hard!&#34; I shouted headbutting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Headbutting is more fun than it should be... I like the clicky-clack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stopped though, A small drop of blood mirrored both our foreheads. It was a draw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you my grandsons were good.&#34; Said grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grawnpa!&#34; The little ones screamed but who was he talking to?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still . Really want one.&#34; Said the God of War. He held Vex, and got nipped fingers that didn&#39;t bleed. &#34;Look at that fire. Kaizen let me have one, eh? I&#39;ll pick him up when he&#39;s two decades. He can marry my daughter, the Demigoddess of Delegation and Tactics Is that fair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I said firmly, but he thought I was playing hard ball.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right. Sorry I lowballed you. He&#39;s an Upper General too&#34; He scratched his chin. &#34;How about my 9th? She&#39;s single. Joan Arches took a vow of chastity though. But a mate bond would nullify such a promise&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I cannot put a price on my sons.&#34; I said calmly, but Willow looked about ready to cuss him out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel that At least let me get dibs on their training.&#34; He asked excitedly. &#34;Damn I forgot there&#39;s *three* of you-OH My Gods A Baby Dwagan!&#34; Lord Aris held Vex and gently snatched the poorly flying lil&#39; Zozo and they kind of bit his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck off Bird Boy.&#34; Said Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh come on!&#34; War yelled, holding the boys like plushies. &#34;I never get to have *any* fun. You won&#39;t let me make WWIII. You won&#39;t let me unleash the Rage Plague. You won&#39;t even let me have concubines anymore. I treat them good!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said Pick A *Goddess to WED* and It&#39;s Too Effective! I already told you if you&#39;re going to make a new affliction, a cure Must be POSSIBLE for MORTALS to figure out!&#34; Yelled Uncle Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ll be Fine! I worked 200 thousand years on that damn project!&#34; He yelled back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO. And if you ask again, or for my nephews, I&#39;m going to smite you again.&#34; He hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>War looked like he saw a ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Wouldn&#39;t *Actually* Fucking Do That!&#34; Xaxas yelled at him, summoning a newspaper and bonking him on the head with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ow!&#34; Aris complained. &#34;You so would; especially if I beat your ass agai-OW!&#34; he held his head. He&#39;d earned a second bonk it was paper. About the most he hurt was Aris&#39;s pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop being dramatic. I didn&#39;t say you couldn&#39;t visit.&#34; Xaxas held Aristaeus to his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle.&#34; He beamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck I want some twins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The royal court was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you?&#34; Asked grandfather. &#34;I&#39;m sure you could do this right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My uncle fucking *panicked* now that he&#39;d said it in company like the Horned One It&#39;s *going* to happen. Grandpa loves his grandchildren, and Xaxas is an incredibly high god mated to the Risen One. Their pup might be a Lesser God, not a demigod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I doubt they&#39;ll have a number higher than 7 or 8? Maybe 9.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ll swing it by Harmony. I Shit. I gotta go.&#34; He vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandfather laughed. &#34;That&#39;s the same reaction I had when I realized I had to make him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to make their son?&#34; Asked Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xaxashevaal would be a good father, but I will at least give him a *chance* to first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I request something?&#34; Asked Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. I had an idea If he is the Judge shouldn&#39;t there be a Jury and Exicutioner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was a good idea It reminded me of the human saying &#39;The Judge, the Jury, and the Exicutioner.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Court of Night Is Incomplete</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should be the one to text that to him. I feel like if I say it, he&#39;ll take offence that I interfere. Said the Horned One</p>
                
                
                
                <p>----Xaxas----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t go home. I went to my realm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your majesty do you need anyth-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I said almost angrily, since I was angry with myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;t though my demons would rip that innocnet soul apart, and offer them up on  my altar from something as simple as a glare</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You can&#39;t buy loyalty like that. It is earned by being a good god.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if I&#39;m not?! What if they only serve because it is my will? I let them breathe and live as they please so long as they break no laws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My children might even change the Number Order</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ll make sure they don&#39;t. They will be under War and Mercy. That is fair, they were first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There also must be Some Light Court in High Places for the balance</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why do I do this to myself Why am I stalling</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did I come down here Is this *fear*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I &#39;hahed&#39; to smell my breath that *was* fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s  impossibly rare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I do want this Since before I received my promised mate I have wanted to make a child</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with Harmony the way she is, I could totally make little godlings easily but then do I want them to age like that? A million years to become a one year old but the slower you&#39;re raised the more you learn The more skilled you can become if you have the talent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or do I do what father did to Birrai&#39;shivaal age him with the sun a few hundred years</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And let them inherit mortal hesitation and weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But compassion too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I figured you were down here uncle.&#34; Said Grace. Of all Bryson&#39;s children, I liked that one the most. She was sweet, and sensitive like Eclipse, but no one knows that about her, not even herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Three little one What I do makes waves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then make some.&#34; She said handing me a mortal beer. It was her offering, and I took it. &#34;Can I watch?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold still while I get Harmony I&#39;ll only do this if she wants.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know why I hoped she said she wasn&#39;t ready yet I hoped Grace didn&#39;t see my excitedly shaking hands</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Before Bryson, or even Asanguis&#39;s ascension, there was me Just me. I said I wouldn&#39;t allow myself to become attached, and here I was. I scoffed at myself. I even subconsciously teleported *outside* the house, and unlock the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why&#39;s the group chat blowing up?&#34; She asked a little confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I kind of put my foot in my mouth&#34; I sat in my recliner I let her sit in my lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put her soft hands on my face. &#34;you&#39;re burning up.&#34; She said kissing my forehead. &#34;Your crown&#39;s fire is almost to the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is? Oh right. Do you want kids?&#34; I asked and she looked shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Why not?&#34; she smiled. She hugged my neck. &#34;Let&#39;s have a pair of triplets I think it&#39;s a good idea that they aren&#39;t alone. Plus they can be in matching outfits.&#34;</p>
