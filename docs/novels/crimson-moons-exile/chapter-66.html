                <p>chapter and a half before it switches to Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Don&#39;t worry guys, I got the good stuff lol</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eternya hummed deeply, looking Ellio in the eyes so intensely that he looked away. To be honest, his eyes were so expressive that it was possibly just his passive stare. That gaze was one of a King; he wasn&#39;t messing around. I didn&#39;t like it nor the fact that he knocked Jack out by just grabbing him. Samira went with him to the clinic, since she felt she didn&#39;t say enough. She did He was just doing his job. Though knowing Jack, he probably did it on impulse too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are all marked by my master&#39;s father; I am satisfied with them. But You&#34; Eternya turned to Flora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still didn&#39;t trust him I don&#39;t know if I did either. He was a general of Kaizen&#39;s Uncle, and only here because Xaxas said he wouldn&#39;t interfere in this business. The Realm King shouldn&#39;t have sworn off complete inaction, but if he didn&#39;t the other Gods and Guardians who did with him might not have either. And I would have no real idea, only speculation as to who made King Xaxas choose to stay at his castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must pledge.&#34; She said breaking the silence. Flora was unable to meet his gaze, but she still stood next to the 5 minotaur, Alavastros included.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye little daughter. Even if they hailed to Arviel, they do not hold the taste of fire&#39;s flicker. You can Not be unaccounted for.&#34; He said sternly. &#34;I assume for their sakes you will pledge; but it&#39;ll quite literally knock you outa few hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; She asked. &#34;I have lived since directly after the War. Surely-&#34; He laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am at least twice that. The mark is more than *Just* being claimed. Lord Kaizen gives all in his band his grandfather&#39;s boon.&#34; He said sternly. &#34;Albeit a minor version of it, with Lady Willow being the exception.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I need the mark to care for my children. I want to do it now.&#34; She said confidently. I wanted to help, but what could I do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you should have a taste of Willow&#39;s blood. She is his mate; she holds the same permission he does.&#34; Said Eternya answering my question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know how to do anything.&#34; I mumbled These guys were bragging about being older than written language, yet I was only 27. I shouldn&#39;t feel so incompetent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Lord Kaizen is merely a century, yet I and the Pit were summoned to this realm to guard his lands. That should show the Quality of his blood little vixen.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;Bite your wrist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d never purposefully inflicted pain on myself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I can do that either.&#34; I admitted looking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have an idea.&#34; Eternya went into the kitchen and rummaged around. He put a red-hot thumb claw to the edge of it, and honed the blade. It rang as it shaved the hair off his arm &#34;There. It&#39;s no dagger, but if it can cut my feather fuzz, it should cut so fine you don&#39;t feel anything.&#34; He encouraged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was putting too much faith in me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure this will work?&#34; I asked holding the small knife. It seemed this ritual required my participation. She couldn&#39;t just bite my arm I had to willingly give my blood</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, along with sharing through your horns.&#34; He said sitting on the couch. He turned on As the Globe Rotates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait you watch that *garbage*?&#34; Blurted Alavastros.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?! Mortal shows are entertaining! Plus, Lovers and Baseball: Atlanta isn&#39;t on yet.&#34; He said defensively. He was a bird; maybe he liked the drama. Plus, he might have done this to calm the others down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your time zones are off father; they come on at noon here.&#34; She said sheepishly. So she watched too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OOO.&#34; He said legitimately excited  He turned it on, and they were doing a recap episode, so the new one had to come on sometime in the near future. &#34;Hurry up and pick what you both are going to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was starting to see a pattern with the Night&#39;s creatures They were terrible people who did bad things, but their personalities weren&#39;t so bad. Many of them in their &#39;time off&#39; were &#39;normal&#39; people, and the angels were hypervigilant because their charges are so easily killed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their Job Must Be Much More Stressful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your thought&#39;s more loaded than you know. I&#39;ll tell you later.&#34; He said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;m ready.&#34; I mumbled. I cut my hand. It hurt like a papercut, but I offered the palm of my hand to her before it healed. She tried to be gentle, and as gross as it was, the ritual was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught her when she fell asleep, and carried her upstairs. Her sons followed in silence, understanding what I did, just not having the language to share their thoughts. When they came back, Eternya got himself some wine out her cabinets, and put a gold coin in its place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I may be a bad guest, but I&#39;m not inconsiderate.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;Anyway, press your horns to each of your subordinates and think of your native language. I&#39;ve seen my master do this a hundred times.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were concerned for their mother, but he must have already explained all this to them in half-beast since none of them were freaking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gingerly pressed my forehead to the black haired one first. They smelled like Scottish Springtime soap. And I saw his life&#39;s story. His days were filled with pets and treats It was like he was trying to show me how he saw Flora, and occasionally a large bull who shifted to spar with them all. That was his father, Rezzol. His coat pattern was like a standard spotted cow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t rough or mean, even grazing with them overnight.I focused on sharing English with Wix I&#39;d heard his name before, but I know I didn&#39;t remember it. His Brother Ark was next then Rubin, the blonde. He didn&#39;t understand his memories of his father at the time, but I did. Those shamed looks There was a lot of hurt and disappointment that came with mindless children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This didn&#39;t happen with harpies, centaur, or satyr Those peoples were born with human heads, so they had the human mind Minotaur are basically two legged bulls, and were one of the first cursed creatures made by Humblon, Lord of Mercy and Second Chances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was about all I knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All 4 of them lived lives down there eating grass, and before that they kind of just wandered in the forest with Flora as their diligent shepherd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was intense.&#34; I said seeing all 4 of them nap without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what I was doing, so I really hope I did it right. I know they saw my human life but mine wasn&#39;t a bad one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; Said Eternya. &#34;The master sent a thumbs up, so he&#39;s satisfied. I&#39;m to remain here until your mate has returned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok um. Can you tell me about the war?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chair next to him was pushed with hot air</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want to know the gritty bits about their origins, don&#39;t you?&#34; He said with a cheeky grin. He turned off the tv, reclining back. His show&#39;s new episode had aired, and I wondered how much time I spent doing that Holy crap it was 3pm!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With the half beasts, understand first that the mixing of blood isn&#39;t illegal. All creatures were made able to make love with, and implant seed in any under the sun. That part all the gods agreed on except Humblon, Lord of Mercy, Second chances, and Purgatory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arviel made Jerold&#39;s mother, Glycasia of Athenia as he does all his creatures, but Especially her since she was a Temple of the Light Priestess. Arviel sent no angels to such a small place, but he protected her village passively, and blessed them with health but she fell in love with the Bull Demon General Torrus. You can imagine the gossip. He didn&#39;t even have a mortal form, being a giant talking beast. I don&#39;t know how deep their &#39;love&#39; was, but I never asked. To be fair, it might have started as a trade for her body to save her people That was common then too.&#34; He said scratching his chin</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s barbaric.&#34; I said as he chuckled. He poured himself some more wine. With that bottle empty he seemed to summon a white wine this time with magic, and flipped another coin in there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Imagine you&#39;re still mortal, and your mate came to kill, eat, and probably fuck the entire town.&#34; He said with a small smile. &#34;What could an *unarmed female* mortal do against a high general? The Church would not send their high ranks to a place so isolated and insignificant. Had she been in Rome, of course, or any other major city. Think about how you all reacted when I landed.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;She broke her vows for her people, at least at first.... No one was mad at her for that; it was the continuation of it that made the issue. The mortals hid her away Until she became fat with child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was silent because he was right. I legitimately freaked out with everyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it wasn&#39;t all bad I imagine he wouldn&#39;t sneak from hell to see her against the master&#39;s wishes if it was Just That. This was Completely Unheard Of, a Demon Defying his master. Then Arviel found out when he had to make the hybrid soul. You can imagine how pissed he was that his mortals weren&#39;t fighting the demons; they were fucking them, and Humblon cursed her. She birthed Jerold, naming him Aeschylus, but he was mindless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. When the Horned One found out, he ordered Torrus back *Immediately*. He punished Torrus so harshly, all hell was silent for a day, that part I witnessed., but I do not know the outcome. Some say he was tossed in the Pit, though as such a high demon, maybe not He was meant to be the Lord of Aggression Yet another sits there. That Lord&#39;s name is so long it makes him angry when he introduces himself.&#34; He chuckled. And continued.</p>
