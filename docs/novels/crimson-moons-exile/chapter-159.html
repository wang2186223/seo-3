                <p>A/N: Again, thank you Teresa for your comment!!!! I had ALL this thinking it was ALREAD Y out!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Asked Asanguis, but I won&#39;t think it twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;ok&#34; I said holding my little sister. &#34;I have pups now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; said dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember. Remember when we had our trip?&#34; I asked. Mom sat down and let the kettle boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Said mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We really did go up there and Drew and Amanda really are dead but I was spared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This.&#34; I showed them my mark. &#34;I don&#39;t know if you can see it but we got attacked The things that go bump in the night are *real*.But one saved me because I&#39;m his mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They don&#39;t know what you&#39;re saying.&#34; Said Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t see anything.&#34; said mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry. That&#39;s cheating.&#34; Chuckled Asanguis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two points.&#34; Said Arviel. &#34;Get seven more and you&#39;ll earn a Lia coin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was a good idea.&#34; Said Gulteer. &#34;Want some fried fingers Lord Asanguis? I finally fucking figured out how to make &#39;um&#34; Crunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.Sigh&#34; Said Arviel. &#34;Those are sinner fingers, do as you please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t dare offend you in your house.&#34; Said Gulteer. He bowed his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I appreciate it. Despite what Uriel says, you&#39;re pretty pleasant.&#34; He cringed in disgust with their enthusiastic munching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. They shared a bucket of fingers What the Fuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pass me the Soul Soda.&#34; Said Asanguis.  HellMart Brand liquid sinner in a can</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Are you alright?&#34; Asked mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Crunch*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah just remembering it it&#39;s hard.&#34; I lied. Well.  Half lied</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I I swear I thought I did but it vanished before I could make it out.&#34; Said Uncle Clarence, with rising suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could work with that the more they believe the more they&#39;ll see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did too. It looked like a circle I think?&#34; mumbled dad. So that makes two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not supposed to outright show you anything. not until you say yes. If you say no &#34; I hesitated. I&#39;m sure I can&#39;t outright mention Xaxas, Gulteer, or Asanguis &#34;You won&#39;t even remember I came.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s heavy.&#34; Said dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s so much so much to show you, and so much will be overwhelming I&#39;m not even human anymore.&#34; I was allowed to say it, because I can&#39;t prove it yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything I&#39;m saying is BASELESS until they say yes, or I can prove it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kettle whistled, and I rocked my little sister other than the odd hair and eyes, she looked like I did in all my baby photos</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been through a lot&#34; Said mom. &#34;You escaped. You escaped my little girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom I didn&#39;t escape anything. I&#39;m married.&#34; I showed them my ring. &#34;Those are purple diamonds.&#34; A color that doesn&#39;t really happen &#34;I had twin boys Vex and Ari&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll find out how to get them back.&#34; Said Clarance. &#34;I have a few favors I can pull at the Church. I can-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m alright.&#34; I interrupted, passing my sister back. &#34;Before anyone gets too heated. I need to say this next part first. Don&#39;t say &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no&#39; please not until you&#39;ve made up your minds on what I came to ask. And it must be unanimous.&#34;  Well, except for the baby. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s already getting her fate changed to have a mate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I say we should all be smart about it, and let her speak.&#34; Said dad, while Asanguis nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you I... the attack was real we were in the woods, and they were drunk. We were having a good time&#34; I saw flashes of what happened &#34;Fuck..Seeing Drew be ripped in half was so visceral so carnal So.. So unreal.&#34; I mumbled. Arviel put a gentle hand on my shoulder I didn&#39;t expect that...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate that I lost you, you know.&#34; Said Arviel. There is comfort that comes with his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck it. Werewolves and monsters are Real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Knew It.&#34; Said my uncle. &#34;I KNEW those bodies were too ripped up to be Just a bear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right but this is so fantastical.&#34; Mom mumbled. &#34;I kind of got what you were saying earlier, but&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you just need some rest.&#34; Said my dad. &#34;But I believe her. Some Monster did get you, and kept you locked upforced you to have babies and call them puppies Willow, you can tell us the truth. You don&#39;t have to make up stories.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe that&#39;s the only way she can make sense of it&#34; said mom. &#34;But I don&#39;t get it how&#39;d she get her car? It was in the garage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait.I saw it appear.&#34; Dad stood. I guess enough doubt was in his heart to make him remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas did that on purpose to help me. I need to thank him for that. Doubt and suspicion from Nothing is HARD.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They really are. My husband is one of them. He saved me, even becoming a fugitive for his people for it and was pardoned by their king. There&#39;s a whole other world literally IN this town I can&#39;t leave this house. I asked to bring you home, but unlimited visits is better I asked because I can&#39;t Take it that I&#39;m having a nice life and you&#39;ll never see how wonderful it is.But I didn&#39;t think it write I Rip all of you from your lives&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; But where is he?&#34; Asked dad. &#34;. And how were you in your old car?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Magic is real too. Hey Asanguis, can you hold this?&#34; I gave him a cup of tea, and they saw it vanish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*magic!*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn It!&#34; He laughed. &#34;Well done mortal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Way to go kid!&#34; Said Xaxas. He shook Asanguis&#39;s shoulder. &#34;I told you she could do it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A coin with Arviel and Lia&#39;s face on one side, and the Sun&#39;s crest on the other appeared in my hands. They were allowed to see that, but not them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you earned a full 10 points.&#34; Arviel vanished, keeping himself hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Played Willow.&#34; Said Xaxas with a single clap, but he didn&#39;t reveal himself either . Not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of them said &#39;yes&#39; but that agreement is in the bag!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why&#39;s the Horned One and the Moon Goddess symbol on your neck.. What did you get involved with?!&#34; Asked Clarence.</p>
