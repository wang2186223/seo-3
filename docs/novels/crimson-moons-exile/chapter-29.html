                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care what you say, this was my fault.&#34; He said with red eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was the one who trusted him. How many times have you warned me about magic, supernaturals, and other stuff?&#34; I asked while sitting on the bed. He sat next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;..A few, but that&#39;s Not the point. I should have sent Ace with you I have a headache.&#34; He said putting his clawed fingers on his temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me.&#34; I mumbled. I let him put his head on my lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t touch my horns.&#34; He warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I assumed it was because the flame still flickered between his horns. I didn&#39;t want to get burned, so I just rubbed his ears. He hummed, yawning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to lose you.&#34; He said fighting sleep. He needed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t. I&#39;m right here and the pack isn&#39;t going anywhere.&#34; I said letting him snore on me I took a hot shower, and when I changed into some pajamas, he laid on his back. Kaizen was Out, and his stomach growled</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to join him until his phone vibrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost thought it was a scam but I answered it. The contact wasn&#39;t saved in his phone, but it could be important</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Kaizen?&#34; Asked the gruff voice.  It was deep and rich; you could Tell he was in charge. I wondered was this one of the council members he was talking about. I Knew his brother didn&#39;t sound this authoritative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; I lied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Worse than a vagabond a Liar.&#34; The man tisked me, shaming me. Oddly enough, it did get under my skin. Whoever this was, wasn&#39;t the kind of man to be played with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not telling you. How&#39;s that for the truth.&#34; I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get &#39;um baby.&#34; Said Kaizen in his sleep. He rolled over to sleep on his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice chuckled. &#34;I like her.&#34; Said a female voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Bryson God of Justice, his father.&#34; Said the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.You know, Justice is a dish best served cold. If it were served warm, it would be just *water* .&#34; I said remembering Kaizen&#39;s comment on him liking dad jokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, I Really like her.&#34; Said who had to be his mother. She giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gods.&#34; I could tell he facepalmed. &#34;If I hear that joke One more time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn!&#34; I snapped my fingers. I should have known.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assume you both found somewhere nice?&#34; He questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We did.&#34; I said being vague. I didn&#39;t know if they should know or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m calling as a warning. The 14th Seat and his family went missing. Tyson automatically blames Kaizen, and has moved up his bounty to 100 million, dead or alive.&#34; He said seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He Can&#39;t do that!&#34; I yelled. &#34;What about investigation, fair trials, and due process?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the way of wolves. I will not interfere, nor will my brothers or father. Tyson is King, my mate is his Third. She and the Second Seat advised against this, but we are inclined to respect it.&#34; He grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what should we do?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has no idea where you both are, so for now, save this phone number. If I catch wind of anything, as Kaizen&#39;s father, I won&#39;t Let them kill each other.&#34; He grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will sir it&#39;s unfortunate that we meet like this.&#34; I said seeing my mate get up. It sucked that he likely wouldn&#39;t sleep now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can just call me Bryson.&#34; He said sternly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not running father.&#34; Said Kaizen with a yawn. &#34;Let the ungrateful little shit have his tantrum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really don&#39;t like this.&#34; Said his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t either, but I will do what I have to do.&#34; He said taking the phone from me gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We love you son.&#34; Said his mom. She sounded so sad. &#34;Please don&#39;t fight your brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you too mom... and I Swear on my blood I won&#39;t unless he throws the first punch.&#34; He hung up. He ran his fingers through his hair, and snarled deeply. &#34;What a Fucking mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go back to bed.&#34; I tried to sooth him but he pulled me into his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Can&#39;t maybe you can.&#34; He said kissing me softly on the top of the head. He hugged me like I was a stuffed animal. It felt nice to be squished, but Kaizen&#39;s touch held a lot of anxiety</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the morning, maybe we can talk with the others and make an evacuation plan just in case.&#34; I said truthfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tyson is likely coming with an army if he discovers this place. It would make war with the goblins, but he seems keen on bringing me in.&#34; He pushed me over on the bed gently and pet my hair. He scrolled through his phone. &#34;There it is.&#34; He waved his hand over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; I demanded, putting my head on my pillow. At first, I was going to protest, but somehow, I found myself drifting off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got up and started stripping. &#34;I&#39;m taking a shower. Go to bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I did cast a spell on you. It amazes me how susceptible humans are I didn&#39;t even say the magic words.&#34; He said shaking his head. &#34;Sorry. Goodnight.&#34; He said kissing me on the forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up to an empty bed. The clock on the bedside read 2:42pm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That dirty bastard.&#34; I said hopping out of bed to look for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was in the guest room up here, talking with Gilbert, Jack, and Ace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I fear since he caught on so fast, that he will follow my scent here.&#34; Said Jack. &#34;Forgive me sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t apologize, all this was my idea. You don&#39;t carry a strong scent, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll figure something out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, I heard of tunnels that lead into the forest.&#34; Said Ace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. It&#39;s settled then. We won&#39;t leave unless we Have to. Take this and buy the tour bus you were talking about. Park it at the end of the tunnel. If he comes here, you three are to Leave With the pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I charged, attacking him with all my might. &#34;That&#39;s for putting magic on me!&#34; I yelled, punching him in his exposed abs, but he stood there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. What is this Supposed to be?&#39; He asked with a raised brow. He was hot in just sweats but I held my resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me kicking your ass!&#34; I yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed, grinning that I couldn&#39;t get him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look he gave me made me stop I did Nothing to him. I knew I wouldn&#39;t. &#34;You could have at least pretended to be hurt.&#34; I grumbled His smile made me feel like a rabbit for some reason</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;no.&#34; He said putting his hand on top of my head. &#34;You can&#39;t go without sleep I can&#39;t either, but I know I can handle it better than you.&#34; He said with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll take our leave sir.&#34; Said Gilbert. They all seemed to share knowing looks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they left out the door, I was picked up and kissed.  He held me close to his warm body, and I wrapped my legs around his waist, and my hands around his neck. &#34;Let me be mad at you.&#34; I complained he kissed me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as electric as it was arousing He took control of that kiss, walking with me to our room. There were &#39;woos&#39; and I blushed, but he didn&#39;t slow down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; he said amused he took my breath away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put me on the bed, and ran his hands down my sides. &#34;I need you.&#34; He said seriously. &#34;I can&#39;t have them take you from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere.&#34; I said kissing him this time. I held the sides of his face, and he ran clawed hands down my sides to my hips. I could feel him flex his claws as his kiss became more intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you, you know.&#34; He said climbing on top of me. He shimmied off my pants, and I moaned. &#34;You don&#39;t have to say it back I know you&#39;re human. The bond won&#39;t have as strong of a hold on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took my shirt off, and I was now bare before my mate I did love him though. I could Never go back to the hum-drum life I had. I could never see this world the same way ever again. And I could Not imagine a life without him He was my protector, the man who swore his life away to me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re wrong Kaizen. I do love you. You&#39;re silly as you are my protector.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We shared this moment. He was on top of me, and I could feel his hardness. The deep, passionate kiss we shared had me pinned underneath him He caged me as he nibbled my neck, and my mark spot thrummed, sending waves of desire to my core</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me show you how I feel.&#34; He said with a sinister smile.</p>
