                <p>A/N: Memphis is Memphia in this book bc I think it looks better</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asanguis didn&#39;t shift for his fight, but rather wore his robes and brandished a mighty scythe. Yet, that wasn&#39;t what Arviel glanced at. He wanted to pet the boys. I think he probably saw them as animals, but even still</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That one I wasn&#39;t so sure about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s literally the cause of about maybe 40% of all of today&#39;s problems, with grandfather being the other 40% and the rest is humans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!&#34; They both said at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s true and you know it.&#34; I said doubling down. I was told I was allowed to speak. So I would</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You little ingrate.&#34; Laughed the Horned One.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;d he say?&#34; Asked dad. He was watching Asanguis It seemed the arena eld more attention than even my sassy comment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That *I&#39;m* the cause of almost half the world&#39;s problems, I mean *he* is, but I&#39;m not.&#34; They both said at the same time  They even pointed to each other with a thumb at the same time. Weird. It&#39;s like their .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t finish that.&#34; Warned Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the harm?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Starting shit. I&#39;ll teleport you into oncoming traffic and you&#39;ll have to find your own way home.&#34; Xaxas warned seriously, elaborating on his threat. By that wording, he meant another planet entirely too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I could port to hell then get home from there? That would still be a bitch though Like I&#39;d still have to know What direction I need to aim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-&#34; I was stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t even finish that thought boy.&#34; Xaxas hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was he going to ask?&#34; Asked the Horned One. &#34;I wasn&#39;t paying attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t either. Let the mortal ask. This is fun. Asanguis and Aris aren&#39;t close in strength, but Aris makes up for it with battle skill.&#34; Said Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I bet you Zearth that my son wins anyway.&#34; Said the Horned One. He was cocky, resting his cheek on his knuckles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s your *favorite* world?! Don&#39;t the mortals call it Halloweenia?&#34; Said Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye. Only my monsters live there, though I still made the witches look mortal.&#34; Zuviel said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright Then you can have Aearth.&#34; Arviel did the same thing, though his head was tilted to the right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No complaining if you lose. You *really* love your angel planet.&#34; Said Zuviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have my word. No complaints, nor retaliation.&#34; Said Arviel. They shook wrists. They both looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asanguis managed to catch Aris and slammed him into the dirt. Aris jumped up off his back, and used his sword to block a slice from Asanguis&#39;s scythe. All this was done impossibly fast. I had trouble keeping up with the red and blue blurs zipping across the arena, and the loud clang of metal hitting metal kind of hurt my ears even from this far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, we aren&#39;t related little Kaizen, though we do tend to mirror when we are both in a good mood or collaborate.&#34; Said the Horned One. &#34;I assume that is the mortals&#39; &#39;forbidden&#39; curious question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are simply opposing forces. We are not of each other in any way.&#34; Said Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are not so petty that a mortal&#39;s curiosity froths us into a rage most of the time.&#34; Chuckled Zuviel. &#34;We appreciate the attempt though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We tend to mirror each other, because we are in sync.&#34; They both said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are times when we-&#34;Arviel didn&#39;t finish his statement. He made a small literal sun the size of a marble, balancing it on the tip of his pointer finger, and sent it to grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It went from the brightest little ball to a small, though contained, black whole as it was passed to the Horned One. On his finger it sucked all the light around it, and it vanished by his will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can predict the other.&#34; Said Grandfather. &#34;We are the ebb and flow, the constant power that molds all around us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s better that we hold no relation Lulliba is my only full god daughter.&#34; Arviel said it, and grandfather cringed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve heard about that kind of thing in mythology. So none of it&#39;s true?&#34; I asked. I wouldn&#39;t bring up the pairing that almost happened that came to mind, but grandma heard me She cringed now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ew, that&#39;d be weird.&#34; Said grandfather. &#34;You&#39;re makin&#39; it weird Kaizen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So weird. Let&#39;s punish him.&#34; Grinned Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait! What did I do?!&#34; I yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you just want to keep testing him &#39;til he breaks. He isn&#39;t a fly to pin to a board and add to your collection.&#34; Grumbled the Horned One saving me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh come on, like Your hobbies are better, wood twiddler.&#34; Arviel grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;d Ever seen grandfather flustered ever</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I know.&#34; Arviel teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m getting pretty good!&#34; Countered the Horned One defensively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All you make is Moon Goddess *Figurines*.&#34; Laughed Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SEE!&#34; yelled Xaxas. &#34;I told you nobody does that old man hobby!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You play Mortals Video Games with Aris!&#34; yelled grandfather dramatically. &#34;And I *am* an old man! I like old man things, gamer boy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least it isn&#39;t mate obsession!&#34; my uncle grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And all you do is follow YouTube tutorials while I have *talent*!&#34; Zuviel accused, pointing at Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t badger-weasel your way out of this!&#34; Arviel Jeered. He was laughing so hard at grandfather&#39;s frustration that his cheeks were red. &#34;And don&#39;t lie about it either! I&#39;ve SEEN them!&#34; Arviel laughed. He actually had one. I facepalmed. &#34;Look!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Never Denied It. And They&#39;re Action Figures!&#34; Zuviel yelled, completely agitated, and summoned one and moved the little arms, he then showed Arviel that his could as well and he did look impressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think you can make one of Lia?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could try? Lia would you like to be an action figure?&#34; Asked the Horned One.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO!&#34; She yelled Her bark was a little rosier than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gods. I&#39;m leaving.&#34; Said grandma. &#34;I&#39;m running away.&#34; This was pure sarcasm, but I don&#39;t know if grandfather caught on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? No! Butterfly.&#34; Said the Horned One.. Grandma was ruby red with embarrassment too. There was the slightest pink tinge to her silver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I come?&#34; I asked to try to escape *whatever the fuck this was*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Traitor.&#34; Scoffed grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be fair I did almost smite him out of curiosity.&#34; Said Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t smite my children. I have my own plans.&#34; The Horned One glared at me like it was *my* fault she was leaving!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t the one giving &#39;figurines&#39; of my mate away!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Willow----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, if I didn&#39;t see these &#39; mighty and powerful gods&#39; as people then, I do now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like watching a family reunion, except I don&#39;t think any of them exactly knew what that was, or would value it. While they watched the Horned One make a Lia statue I watched Asanguis become the second biggest monster I&#39;d ever seen. The Herold was first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He screeched and blew acid in the arena.  And melted Aris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And That What You Get For Kicking Me In The NUTS!&#34; He screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It Was An Accident!&#34; Aris yelled, being melted. He dissolved</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got the arena.&#34; Said Zuviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got my son.&#34; Said Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remove my punishment. I believe this is befitting.&#34; Said Xaxas. He casually waved his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the snap of both the Lords of Light and Night&#39;s magic made the poison vanish and Aris looked like the normal depiction of himself. His large red wings spread open, and he flew above the crowd. They went wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Sovereign is Renewed!&#34; He roared, and they did with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know. I don&#39;t want your light world.&#34; Said the Horned One.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may have it Void King. Aris lost fairly.&#34; Said Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I&#39;ll just ruin it, and there won&#39;t be balance to justify keeping Zearth.&#34; Said Zuviel. &#34;Instead give me one of your disobedient worlds. Your worst one, a world you were going to destroy anyway preferably.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.So long as I get to watch.&#34; Said Arviel. A key was passed. &#34;Eararth. One skip away from Rearth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I know where this is.&#34; The Horned One laughed. &#34;This is the planet of &#39;Detroit meets Memphis&#39; in your words but with mechs.&#34; Said Zuviel. I didn&#39;t know what those references were, but they sounded kind of like Detroyt and Memphia? On Urth, both those towns suffered from the car and train industries leaving their towns. Crime is bad because the people are poor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the way these to spoke, something told me that more was going on if Arviel willingly gave it away Also,  there were worlds where Mechs existed? I was confused, but those two seemed genuinely excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t get me started.&#34; Arviel Rolled his eyes. &#34;Eleven-fucking-billion people, and every one of them is a piece of shit. Even their children are vulgar and distasteful. You&#39;ll see&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Big flashy bang or slow suffering simmer?&#34; Zuviel asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh No Let&#39;s have the mortals pick&#34; Arviel said with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like it, but they may not be ready.&#34; Said Zuviel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well of course they aren&#39;t. But this world is baby&#39;s mash. There are no supernaturals there at all Your generals are green, but this should give them experience. AND you get to see how strong they really are.&#34; Said Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can hear his heart; he doesn&#39;t want to kill for killing&#39;s sake.&#34; Said Zuviel. &#34;I won&#39;t make you either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. for the honor of the Night Court, and for the entertainment of my master I will destroy Eararth.&#34; Kaizen said standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He *chose* do destroy That world was scheduled already but still. They behaved as if the lives of billions meant nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go with him.&#34; Said Xaxas. &#34;Bryson you&#39;re coming too. That should be a pretty good meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryson looked put on the spot to put it nicely. I know he had no qualms of killing, but this world isn&#39;t exactly innocent.</p>
