                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped awake That was intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear turned to embarrassed blushing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pads were at my bedside, a change of sheets and clothes from the car were there too and Master was asleep Damn I couldn&#39;t even Think his name I never felt so humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did that vampire think it was alright to put a spell or whatever this was on Me; I hated that I&#39;d made the wrong choice of not correcting them when  when He was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held me gently enough that I could wiggle free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was a Pet to those damn vampires but worse was that I couldn&#39;t do anything about this. I had to wait, and pray that he wouldn&#39;t command something I didn&#39;t want. He seemed noble enough, and I felt I could trust him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No I Knew I could. That was different. There was no suspicion of his intentions I forced it because I was likely overthinking this. This was magic after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two people bound together. I know I always wanted a connection like this and I also know he did the Night Harlot gave me this blessing but I guess I should call her the Moon Goddess Too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s what we were taught in school, but it seems maybe that was kind of wrong</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went across the street, and left pads. I know that was embarrassing for him and me May he never see how cherry red my cheeks get. There was also a note, along with his card. I would take a shower before reading it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I washed my hair, and brushed my teeth. He bought toothbrushes too there was a simple ham and cheese sandwich on the table, since this cheap motel didn&#39;t even have a fridge or microwave, yet the bread was toasted. It was cold, but that he&#39;d found a way to &#39;cook&#39; it showed he was trying to be courteous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ate, drank the Buckstars Iced Coffee, which was somewhat cold, being by the AC unit and I read the note underneath it was a small pack of powdered doughnuts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I smelled your heat.blossom. You worry me with the amount..... of anyway  Web DR says you&#39;re dying but Um here&#39;s some pads and some food. In the morning I was thinking we could find a nicer hotel. If you want Dashed to Your Door, use my card. Do not worry about the funds on it, I have Plenty.&#34; He wrote.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would order Everything then! &#34;Muahaha!&#34; I whisper yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm...&#34; he said in his sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw an image of him killing, like a two second clip in a movie. The werewolf that he ripped in half with his bare hands screamed in the silence of my vision. I flinched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes and shook my head. That was a Dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ordered delivery. I got Waffle Homestead. The Greasiest food I could think of. Plus it brought back good memories</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were poor students; me and my friends ate there the most since it was close to campus. I also just wanted some breakfast I got sausage, pancakes, bacon, and hashbrowns. For him since I knew he didn&#39;t like greasy food, I got some crisp baked bacon, extra well done sausage, eggs, and special requested 3 beef steaks from the grocery store I knew he had raw I saw the cooler by the AC on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered a moment at the Meat Market the silent, terrified faces of deceased men the chopping of bone the sound of it of the giant meat grinder they threw scraps in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It gave me goosebumps I was going to peek After I got the delivery. Accidently hitting the remote encouraged me to try and take all this gore off my mind</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the 15 channels they had was pitiful, as most of it was local, and even those were half filled with static. But the man came with my meal. I thanked him, and tipped him $100. He&#39;d come here feet away from chopped up people but also I was being cheeky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why, I had no idea especially since I knew Kaster ate people Kaizster it gave me a small headache to try for more That vampire really did a number on me. My growling stomach told me to continue unpacking my breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The food was good despite my slight guilt for ordering it with Kaister&#39;s money now. I&#39;d already remade the bed and put a &#39;Do Not Disturb&#39; sign on the door, and put out the messy sheets in the bag the housekeeper gave. He must have requested that too. Because I hadn&#39;t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt bad for the tip, but he literally risked his life coming here. For Kaizster to be here others had to be too. I remember him telling me about that. They had their own safe spaces, and I could bet money a run down place like this would be one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. oddly enough what he made tasted Better. but now that I was done. I could look inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nervously walked to it, putting my hand on the lid. I made no noise. At least I thought I didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t.&#34; I heard him growl and I turned around. His eyes were red. It made me wonder how long he was awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-&#34; He cut me off. He sat up proper, and crossed his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you See, you can never unsee.&#34; He growled. &#34;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re ready for that kind of responsibility.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that is your wish master.&#34; I said involuntarily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gods damn it woman&#34; He looked as if he regretted telling me &#39;no&#39; &#34;If you want to see, I ordered enough for about a week... it isn&#39;t enough but I couldn&#39;t compel myself to take more. Seven livers, Seven Hearts, 14 leg bones, Oh and some thigh meat.&#34; He said getting up. &#34;I wanted beef, but they were out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened it and to my horror he wasn&#39;t lying The livers and hearts were in cellophane, while each bone was wrapped individually, and a few wrapped muscle chunks looked almost like beef. I wondered why that cooler was so Big.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no words. especially seeing him pull out a leg bone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I allow myself to have 2 bones, one heart, one liver. If I&#39;m still hungry, I have the thigh meat... but honestly, I was hoping to stretch this out. I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be near another Meat Market, since only one or two are in every state. But I&#39;ve never been starving or anything.. not until now This Isn&#39;t Enough.&#34; He said hesitating. &#34;It isn&#39;t but I&#39;ll make do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His stomach audibly growled he&#39;d had only sodas and some whipped cream up until this point. And a meal at the Meat Market</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you asking my permission Kaizster?&#34; I said still mad at myself that I couldn&#39;t just call him his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t want to wake you to such a gruesome meal by your standards. With your people, and a bunch of others having it all pretty, wrapped, then cooked is how you like it. For me to be honest I like my meat still screaming, but I have no choice but for this to do.&#34; He said getting a paper plate out of the container. He must have gotten those from the gas station too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put the entire liver on his plate, and a bone. &#34;I&#39;ll try to be quick. Otherwise, you may do as you please.&#34; He said, probably wanting to tell me to leave, but he didn&#39;t because he respected my choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I choose to stay. I won&#39;t like it, but you have to eat too&#34; I said seeing him reach for it without a fork or knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I ask one more time, are you alright with this? You can leave if you want.&#34; He said with a small glare at his foodTo probably prove a point, he put all the beef in his left hand.. In One bite the extra meat was gone..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That legitimately was startling but I gave a determined nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made such a big stink about it. And I know you haven&#39;t eaten properly so go for it.&#34; I said trying to keep a straight face. He likely knew I was uncomfortable, but he can&#39;t starve for my sake he already lost his status and his people for me as it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just started eating the room smelled like iron but nothing was as bad as the crunch of the bone. He was done in about 5 bites, but with each one I really, truly understood what it meant to be human around a Real monster</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also ate all the steak I bought..One bite a piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it makes you feel better, Meat Market mortals are either death row inmates or farmed. All this is the farm raised, free range variety. I can&#39;t tell the difference between hunted and farmed, since their nutritional needs are met very well.&#34; He hummed, licking his fingers. &#34;I understand if you don&#39;t want to come near a &#39;real&#39; monster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no words His hands caught on fire, and there was no evidence of his meal the paper plate burned so hot, so fast, that there was no smoke He got up to brush his teeth. And when he came back he sat on the bed next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t worry.&#34; He said, and my body calmed from that vampire&#39;s mind control.but I still felt the littlest bit nervous I was glad for it; that meant I would be free soon. He held me in his arms, and pressed me in his chest. He was warm, and his small growl gave comfort</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should be worried, I should have wanted to run away after what I&#39;d seen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be alright.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t smell it again I didn&#39;t want you to see.&#34; He said with sad, crimson marbles He thumbed my forehead with a clawed thumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said I wasn&#39;t against finalizing the mate bond it isn&#39;t right if I look at this with rose glasses.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
