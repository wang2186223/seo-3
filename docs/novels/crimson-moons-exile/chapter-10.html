                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s Got to be him.&#34; Said a Rogue while I got a small pack of pads this was embarrassing enough. I didn&#39;t want to have to deal with this Too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever you Think you&#39;re about to do, Don&#39;t.&#34; I said calmly I didn&#39;t show my true size Yet but I know they sensed my strength. They also smelled like they&#39;d partied all night till whatever supernatural club they went to closed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d listen to him.&#34; Said the clerk. The old man showed no fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them whistled. He was calling his friends as if that would do something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No matter how big you are I&#39;ve never seen a wolf who Isn&#39;t allergic to silver.&#34; Said the leader. &#34;The King wants you Alive. Everyone knows it hell it&#39;s all anyone&#39;s talking about and it ain&#39;t even been a full 48 hours.&#34; Said the Rogue. More of them showed up there had to be about 10 of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not come quietly, your highness. All you&#39;ll get out here is the Rogues&#39; treatment. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get just a slap on the wrist.&#34; He said trying to negotiate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wasn&#39;t going to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like he could be an Alpha, likely one who lost his pack at some point. He was a brown haired male with grey streaks. His wolf was two toned a prize if Hunters found him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear their inner wolves all telling them not to try anything, but they were too stupid to listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader of the gang had a gun and likely silver bullets it was why they were so bold. Granted, he Wasn&#39;t wrong, but I&#39;d never actually been hit with the stuff</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Last chance: Fuck off.&#34; I growled. It was one they could feel in their chest. It took a good portion of my self-control not to just start killing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I shoot your arms and legs you won&#39;t die but you won&#39;t stop bleeding either&#34; He said thinking out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if I cremate you bunch, even if I&#39;m caught, I won&#39;t be charged for defending myself.&#34; I said becoming my true height.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss you said this would be easy.&#34; Said by scent, was likely his Beta. He had his hair in a braid that went to the nape of his neck, having buckskin brown hair, and his wolf&#39;s eyes were green.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever. Former Prince Kaizen, come with Us, and we can drive you up to the King. There&#39;s no need to resist.&#34; He said patting his belt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked briefly at the human, then at the cameras.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll delete the footage of this right?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t call nobody if I get the value of what you break.&#34; He said putting a little sign on the desk that said &#39;lane closed&#39;. He made no effort to run or hide. He seemed as if he wanted to see for himself what a royal werewolf could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out my horns. That was all most of their wolves needed to see. Many kneeled, while the one of Alpha blood was resistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bow.&#34; I commanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They kneeled. Any who hesitated, didn&#39;t now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the difference between an Alpha and a Prince, title or Not.&#34; I said firmly. &#34;Give me that gun.&#34; I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wolf took over to do as I&#39;d commanded, then he kneeled on bended knee. It was a 6 round revolver an old one. It reminded me of one from the 1800&#39;s. I didn&#39;t live back then but I had family that had. It was clean and loaded in fine working order though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now leave.&#34; I pointed to the door and I saw them nearly run. My claws extended and my fangs grew. I wondered should I have killed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ripping them apart would have been No problem at all. Ultimately, they figured it out that I wasn&#39;t playing around Real quick, but now I&#39;d had to use more energy, and made myself a little hungry. My stomach growled, but I needed to reserve what I had. I didn&#39;t know where the next Meat Market would be I should have bought more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The old man removed the sign and rung me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;ll be $11.51 Kaizen, was it?&#34; He mumbled. &#34;Thanks for not getting my place all covered in bullet wholes and gore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know that name.&#34; I said handing him cash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then if anyone asks, I don&#39;t know nothin&#39;.&#34; He said looking at the camera. &#34;I need to erase this before the blood suckers see. I&#39;d like to keep my blood and all.&#34; He stretched. I think he was joking. He was better at hiding his thoughts than most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, and I imagine a pack of Rogues will make trouble for you.&#34; I grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve seen them before. They usually keep to themselves.&#34; He said giving me my change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked across the street, seeing their eyes at the edge of the forest. The small glow from their wolf&#39;s light reflection made my mind up for me I would have let them go but I could tell they were Still planning. Those were the eyes of someone who hadn&#39;t learned their lesson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to put the gun in my glove compartment, then put the pads in the room. I made a note for her too in case I didn&#39;t come back soon. But since I still scented them They lingered like vultures  That was all I needed to confirm my suspicions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No humans were around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked into the woods, and when I didn&#39;t see the street anymore, I stripped, shifting into my muscled might. They were on the move, so I didn&#39;t know if they knew I was coming or not. It could be a makeshift trap, but even if it was, I had their weapon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I trotted about 15 minutes, far enough away that I don&#39;t think the campfire I scented could be seen from the motel</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least 20 wolves were gathered back there in the woods. All male. That was kind of common though. There weren&#39;t many females out here, and if they were, they were with their mates. It&#39;s because there&#39;s a size difference. On average, males are about 30% bigger, stronger, and faster than females. It was why females engaged males rarely, or in units if they Had to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss let&#39;s leave that guy Alone.&#34; Said the Beta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agree with Beta.&#34; Said a smaller wolf, likely their Gamma. The wind was in my favor, blowing my scent away from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took my time walking into the center of their large circle. They all made way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;m inclined to agree with your subordinates too.&#34; I said shifting. &#34;I&#39;m half tempted to just kill you all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t. Not if I send my wolves to collect that gir-&#34; He didn&#39;t have time to Think I was so fast As a red pop of lightning, I flashed in front of him. I&#39;d killed him by ripping his head off his shoulders while he shit talked I hadn&#39;t shifted, but now that I&#39;d killed their leader without thought without control</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest had to die too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The confrontational step I took made them scatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There would be no survivors, and I would make good on cremating them. They were Rogues. No one was looking for them, no one would miss them. If anything, I know I did the local packs a favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Until your leader mentioned my mate, I was Trying to be civil.&#34; I said calmly. They heard me too. I could hear the ripple of thoughts flooding the forest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Willow-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw Kaizen in the forest. At first I thought I was about to relive the first night we met but these faces were different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re sorry!&#34; they screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw him teleport, leaving a trail of red lightning he was so fast. He loaded his middle finger up with it pressed against his thumb. And the scull of the werewolf exploded from a finger flick</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be sorry in hell.&#34; He said zipping to the next person</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by oneHe swiftly killed them. His face was stern, like he didn&#39;t want to do it, but no one could stop him. He was a killing machine. He was covered in blood, but now he looked almost indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We won&#39;t go after-&#34; One of them was killed before he could finish his sentence. He was ripped in half with Kaizen&#39;s bare hands</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your leader spoke for you.&#34; He said simply. There was no emotion to his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Kaizen I knew wasn&#39;t there I couldn&#39;t even make out his eye color. He was almost like a silhouette. He looked Like he was changing... Now there was a small shroud of darkness around him as he killed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have Mercy!&#34; Another screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Gave you my mercy. You would Not take it.&#34; He said simply. He picked him up by the throat. &#34;Goodbye nameless Beta.&#34; He said, snapping his neck.. And his grip made the neck catch on fire. The body plopped to the ground, while the bones were dropped out his palm. The man&#39;s head rolled around on the ground a moment, revealing a horror encased face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Holy Shit!&#34; Screamed another. &#34;Help!&#34; He screamed as he was grabbed by the leg. It was broken, and turned to ash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You Had help. You did not Want it.&#34; He said cocking his head to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please!&#34; He begged. All around me were bodies. All their faces looked Horrified</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No  you&#39;re number 20.&#34; He said letting him run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was struck by red lightning.</p>
