                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated that I remembered about Aris I was planning on my big adventure, filled with bare and beautiful sirens to sing songs about off days. To tempt me to stay forever in their gardens of peaceful, though false serenity. They are temptation given form. They tell you what you want to hear, and lull you into traps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If you can get through their maze, the prize is the best napping place in all the layers</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sounded fun, playing chicken with the she demons. Gods that&#39;s such a strange desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What&#39;s wrong with me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I teleported to Xaxas&#39;s realm, and he judged souls, well the part of him that he parked here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You again?!&#34; He growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait!&#34; I yelled, holding up my hands. He was about to banish me, and he looked pretty pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me one reason why I shouldn&#39;t send you flying home?&#34; He asked with a raised brow. &#34;This is no place for the living, and if you want to speak with me, I&#39;m almost always at Fucking Home!&#34; He snapped his fingers, and I was in fact in his condo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The location change made me want to vomit. He yanked me here this time I&#39;d pissed him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now why did you need me?&#34; He growled. Harmony woke up from her nap, rubbing her eyes on their couch. &#34;And you woke up my mate: Talk boy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aris means me to summon him; I thought your realm was safest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;d invite *another* god, one I do NOT like, without my permission to *my* realm, without asking? While I&#39;m Busy!&#34; He asked with crossed arms. &#34;Tell me why you&#39;re still breathing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He prevented my teleportation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop trying to escape, there is no escape.&#34; He huffed. &#34;I&#39;m not *that* pissed, but next time use your head. You should have fucking called. I was busy.&#34; Harmony turned on the TV. His character was being shot on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were playing earth&#39;s Call of Duty.&#34; Harmony scoffed playfully. It couldn&#39;t be denied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That That&#39;s BESIDES the point!&#34; He grumbled. He died. &#34;If RedH3wk69 kills me one more time, I&#39;m finding his house and eating him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not doing that again!&#34; Yelled Harmony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.Fine! Aris get your ass down here.&#34; He yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already apologized twice now! What the fuck do you want?!&#34; Asked the God of War. &#34;I was *Busy*!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at the screen, then they pointed at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.YOU!&#34; They both shouted at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;S3xyDemon69 I should have figured. You Dirty Cheating Asswhole!&#34; yelled Aris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Virgin Pleb!&#34; Shouted Xaxas. &#34;I Never Cheat!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were using mother Fucking Magic!! AND I&#39;LL HAVE YOU KNOW I HAVE *MOUNTAINS* OF PUSS-women. They&#39;re respectable ladies.&#34; Aris corrected himself sheepishly, looking briefly at Harmony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aris, despite his violent ways was still known as a woman charming male of Arviel&#39;s line. Though because of his nature, most of his children that I know of were mortal except two. It doesn&#39;t matter though since all his children are dead. They are the sons of war, violent men who if not born in wartime make it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You&#39;d think the only two immortal sons would be coveted, but they swore to Xaxas, betrayed him, and were killed for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the contention originally between the two gods, though now it seemed that they&#39;d come to some kind of agreement to at least not attack on sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your realm is a Sausage Fest!&#34; Shouted Xaxas with a laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um.&#34; I tried interrupting, but those two I just let them have at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to borrow this one.&#34; Aris motioned me. &#34;I want you to come rain terror on my warriors. They&#39;re too soft.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Paternity leave.&#34; I said firmly. &#34;Every minute up here is a year I&#39;m losing on my ONE real day off too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exaggerated a bit but the point was made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why can&#39;t I be the bum I was destined to be?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here. Bite it and it&#39;ll take you to my palace.&#34; He tossed me a coin. It had his face on one side, and his sword and shield on the other. &#34;You aided defeating a Contradiction. This is the first world to *Ever* truly recover from such an event.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aris is right.&#34; Said Xaxas. &#34;Contradictions rip and pick at the rules of a world. Their existence is pain for their earth goddess but that only applies for one of our children. Herculian isn&#39;t strong enough to make a Major Catastrophe. Contradictions, Ghoul Kings, and undeath plagues that&#39;s the kind of stuff you may be sent to, so I think this could be good for you. Spend your day off beating the shit out of his children.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t I need like permission to do this?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, and I gave it. Scram. Either go back to hell or visit Valhallya.&#34; Said Xaxas. &#34;Either way, you&#39;re interrupting our match. Get back on your fucking computer bird boy.&#34; The glares they gave each other. It&#39;s personal now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll keep eating shit the rest of the day. I almost felt sorry for you.&#34; He vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You Bitch!&#34; Xaxas snarled. He put on headphones and they started arguing in another language.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what are you going to do?&#34; Asked Harmony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll spend the rest of today off, then the rest training. I wonder what Willow will do her turn.&#34; I said teleporting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wonder did she know that she had a turn too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Willow----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sneezed; weird. I hadn&#39;t since I was given this form. Actually I hadn&#39;t been &#39;sick&#39; like with the cold or flu or anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also I could feel my mate this time around.. I knew he was ok, and the boys were with the Horned One.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning.&#34; I said to the contractor that came in. He was perfect. His pin straight hair was in a high ponytail, and it came down like a glittery blue waterfall. The tips of his hair was a dark, almost black purple. His eyes held the same combination. His skin looked to be made of crystal, though it was smooth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Quel&#39;talyn, the Crystal One.&#34; He bowed. &#34;I was expecting his majesty, but this is better.&#34; He smiled. He immediately put down a blue plan sheet on the table after we shook wrists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Willow, the Horned Kitsune.&#34; I said warmly. He was bright as his diamond skin, which I was glad for. I was worried I&#39;d get some old fart who hates shifters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a kitsune? I have a daughter married to one, though Robert just has the one tail.&#34; He said thinking out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do too, but I can still do magic.&#34; I said looking at the plans. He wanted to make the new attic an additional floor I wasn&#39;t against that. We Did have a basement but that was in use too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then every hundred years you&#39;ll get a new tail.&#34; He beamed. &#34;In my line of work I deal with all walks. I can give you the number of a true nine tail teacher. He resides in Kyota though..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sounded neat</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for the food for thought.I&#39;ll think about it.&#34; I said sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really should. Oh, silly me. Here&#39;s the plans for the second building. With the budget, I can do one or the other. Some wolves like having Omega houses, as they&#39;re close to Alpha&#39;s quarters for protection, but there&#39;s also a distinction between delivery officers and the common Omega houses you already own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second house had 10 rooms; each one was designed to be a studio apartment The attic conversion would have just electrical and one communal shower and bathroom. I think people would want their privacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest, I think we get more rooms with the second house.&#34; I said approving the bigger budget. I was already cleared for that, so it made this easier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We went over the color, style, and material. It would look like a mini packhouse, and when the boys grow up, I bet they&#39;d like the independence of not living on the same floor as their parents. That or they could just have their own homes, or even move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That That made me feel like the world crashed down. I wanted them to stay forever tiny and soft. One day, they will have human forms and be men  but I knew I&#39;d be ready when that came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With magic, we can be done in 4 months, your grace.&#34; He bowed his head. &#34;I look forward to seeing your kids too. I heard they were born literal pups, not just the expression.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled out my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Oh my gods. I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re so small.&#34; He said happily, but the alarm on his phone went off. &#34;I need to visit Lady Fiona next. She&#39;s a new investor here.&#34; He said with one last bow and wrist shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That took Forever but I was proud of myself. Jack brought lunch and I went downstairs to cook it. I didn&#39;t want raw elk, but pan frying it is Amazing. The best part about werewolves they always seem to have fresh food. Heavily seasoned food too when it is cooked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bumped into the girl that was kicked out of GreenMoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry Luna.&#34; She said nearly running away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have lunch with me.&#34; I offered before she could exit. I think it was a little selfish to make her stay, but she looked about ready to pop, and I didn&#39;t want her worry to cause her to pop early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; She said wanting to cook for me, but I didn&#39;t let her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just have a seat at the dining table. I figure I can give you all my baby clothes if you don&#39;t mind so much boy stuff.&#34; I said this casually. I didn&#39;t want anyone to think she was in trouble I hated this aspect of werewolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Luna.&#34; She bowed her head. &#34;I am having a boy so it works out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a &#39;known troublemaker&#39;. I even got links asking was I ok showing her kindness.  Her situation wasn&#39;t all her fault either but no blame was given to Alpha Green. They talked about him, but they dogged her I imagine now though, that they might be nicer to her since I hoped to set a good example. I hope.</p>
