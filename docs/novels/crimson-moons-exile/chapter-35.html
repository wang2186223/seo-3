                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn I was hungover. It was only 7 in the morning Why do I keep waking up with the sun?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen&#39;s phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up in his arms, rummaging around for it. But as he slept, I swear he looked stronger. His arms looked thicker and his fangs as he snored looked longer</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d been going out every night while I was asleep every morning the room smelled like iron. It hadn&#39;t even been that long since he started doing this, but I was beginning to get worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I answered the phone. &#34;Hello?&#34; I asked politely. The number was different it might not have been his parents. It wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be the woman he marked.&#34; Said the voice. Oddly enough, it sounded like I was talking to Kaizen but I didn&#39;t get the same feeling from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am.&#34; I said a little offended for some reason, it sounded like that was an insult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took an impatient breath &#34;Tell Kaizen to Come Home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He won&#39;t do that. He&#39;s wanted by his own brother&#34; I said silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His brother wants him because he killed 25 people.&#34; The voice snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t *grr* at me.&#34; I whispered angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your majesty maybe have the mortal explain what happened.&#34; Said another man. So the first person had to be his brother while the other was a Council Member.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would that be acceptable to you?&#34; Tyson asked me He sounded kind of like he had a chip on his shoulder. If he thinks his tone was going to scare me. He was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It would.&#34; I said honestly, holding my composure, not being lured into the childish argument that will probably happen anyway. &#34;I guess I should skip to the part you all want to hear?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, the beginning.&#34; Said Tyson firmly. Kaizen hummed in his sleep He&#39;d Just gone to bed; I doubt he&#39;d get up anytime soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My friends were going to get married, and took me on a camping trip with them to celebrate. They got really drunk and I was the designated driver It all happened so fast There weren&#39;t any signs on the road or anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You Lie Mortal. I installed the gate myself.&#34; He snarled. &#34;What&#39;s more is that I saw it up myself too when I visited the aftermath.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It Wasn&#39;t there. I have no reason to lie about Anything.&#34; I said firmly, ignoring his growling. &#34;What&#39;s more is that if you&#39;re supposed to be a King, you should Listen.&#34; I said a little bitterly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was silence. I think they were surprised I wasn&#39;t intimidated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As I said, there wasn&#39;t a gate or anything, and if there was, it was obviously hidden. We didn&#39;t know werewolves and fae existed We were surrounded, and my friends were killed in an instant Kaizen did what he did, and How he did it because he lost his mind seeing me in dangerHe has control now. I know he killed a lot of people, but I know he wouldn&#39;t have if they didn&#39;t do what they did first.&#34; I said honestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s right.&#34; Said the council member from before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Son, I think that should at least warrant the lifting of the bounty the way it is.&#34; Said his mother. I forgot she was a council seat. He probably ordered her to give him Kaizen&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was silent a long time. &#34;He had no control, and they disobeyed the lawbut he still should stand trial.&#34; He mumbled. &#34;I&#39;ll send for wolves to investigate the fence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I doubt you&#39;ll find anything now.&#34; I said firmly. &#34;It&#39;s been a while now. Bodies are buried, any evidence like That is bound to be in a river.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The mortal&#39;s right sire.&#34; Said the same man as before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ronitus, be silent.&#34; He snarled. &#34;Mortal you know nothing of the ways of wolves. As it is, he&#39;s killed not only his fellow pack, but also my council seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know enough to see your power trip.&#34; I yelled. &#34;I know enough to see that you&#39;re trying too hard to be King, that you can&#39;t see he did that to save Your life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have his location sire.&#34; Said another man Oddly enough he reminded me of Jack that crazed itchy to kill kind of voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Tell him that he can either come to us, or I can come to him. That Adress is in King Wix&#39;s territory. I&#39;d rather not start a war with the goblins.&#34; He said ignoring me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I demand trial by combat if you&#39;ll leave me the Fuck alone!&#34; Snarled Kaizen. The sudden snarl of my mate made me squeal. He immediately put me in a vice gripped hold, but he made sure not to hurt me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bring Brutos and Jack as well.&#34; Said Tyson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t do that! You Swore to your mom that you wouldn&#39;t fight him.&#34; I protested, but he shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone was dropped on the floor with my wiggling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said I wouldn&#39;t so long as he throws the first punch. Is that agreeable?&#34; He growled a rumble that really did rattle the windows. Holy shit</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.. I&#39;ll give you 48 hours to get your ass up here. Bring the mortal too. If you run, I&#39;m burning it All to the fucking ground, wherever the fuck you are on Wix&#39;s lands. If you leave her there, I will send the hyena shifters to collect her.&#34; He snarled, and the call ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry little mate.&#34; He said still holding me He didn&#39;t care that he&#39;d agreed to fighting his brother He cared more that I freaked out a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m already over it. I just didn&#39;t expect you to explode like that.&#34; I admitted, relaxing He made it clear he wasn&#39;t letting me go unless I showed that I was fine. I honestly was, but I couldn&#39;t be frustrated with his concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. You. You&#39;re more to me than you&#39;ll ever know.&#34; He said letting me go. He got up and grew to his true height. But this time it was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held a small glow in his eyes as he grabbed a few things from the closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want a pack meeting.&#34; He snarled, opening the door of the bedroom, still in his sweats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes boss!&#34; I heard many of them yell in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen held the look and pose of a warrior in a movie, getting ready for war. I put my hand on his shoulder, and his eyes held an expression I couldn&#39;t really read But I could feel his anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we going to leave right Now?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no choice.&#34; He said angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. I feel like no matter what the results of this &#39;trial&#39; is. Will end up with you killed&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get a few days of clothes.&#34; He commanded like a Legion soldier. This wasn&#39;t for debate in his eyes. He ran his fingers through his hair. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean to order you like that it&#39;s a wolf thing.&#34; He said shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I know that much.&#34; I said craning up to kiss him. He met me half way, bending down, and his hands slid slowly down my shoulders, making their way to my waist</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed me on the top of the head. &#34;I&#39;ll try to be less snippy&#34; He said with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We pealed away from each other, and I stuffed some clothes and one nice dress into my luggage bag I should have never unpacked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t say that. You have a right to be comfortable.&#34; He said already done. &#34;You have a right that your home feel like a fucking home Willow. Don&#39;t forget that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re technically criminals. Kaizen the only rights we have will be After this is over.&#34; I mumbled. He was silent a long time. He looked like he wanted to rant about giving me the world but instead he got our bags and the keys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come my Luna&#34; He said putting his hand on the small of my back, and he put his keys in his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, it seemed like every shapeshifter, not just every werewolf was in the living room. They crowded us, but parted way when he went outside. They bowed to us, not just him They called me the title of Luna, even though it wasn&#39;t official. He stood at the steps, at the threshold of the door, and people listened intently, even our neighbor Flora. She however, was likely out to be nosy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hear me MisfitMoon.&#34; He said loudly, holding me under his bare arm. He still hadn&#39;t put on a shirt, but one was passed to him. &#34;The Crown knows of this place I&#39;m not surprised. But it is no longer safe, especially with me gone. Rick, I know you aren&#39;t ready for this kind of responsibility, but in the event of an evacuation, you lead everyone to the vans.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t let you down sir.&#34; Rick Bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were murmurs filled with worry. I could see how concerned looks from the sea of people became They all looked like each person had a sea of questions He continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was told to bring my Beta and Gamma. And I believe I should take Gilbert as well. I cannot have you unattended. It isn&#39;t that I don&#39;t trust you, it&#39;s that I believe the palace may hold answers to your bloodline.&#34; He said sternly. They bowed in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can ride in my minivan.&#34; Said Jack. I didn&#39;t know he had a car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fine.&#34; Said Kaizen. He looked on his phone. &#34;Fuck this is a Long drive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can organize an evacuation.&#34; Said Flora. &#34;You idiots aren&#39;t getting my home burned down.&#34; She grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can drop the act.&#34; Said Kaizen rolling his eyes. &#34;I know you don&#39;t want to see the pups killed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who Would?!&#34; She shouted, earning growls since it was considered disrespectful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s Enough pack.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;As many of you know .me and Tyson are equals So if I do not return, I&#39;ll make sure Wix has another location hidden away for you. None of you deserve this.&#34; He said under his breath, but I knew they likely heard him.</p>
