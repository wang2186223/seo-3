                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was raining in Hell today. The good part was that I could be my true height; the bad was that I didn&#39;t have an umbrella, and I&#39;ll need a shower when I got home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clear water was weird, as it was cooling to the skin, yet the air was still a little hot and dry from all the fires on the other layers. The ancient Roman city was so large, that it does not end. It actually doesn&#39;t. Hell is an eternal realm, housed in the void, as it houses every terrible being to ever have lived. Also, it houses all those killed by my kin as well. Most of them are innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That being said The sign had markers on the road for the line. I was forty minutes into it. five more left to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Granted, many offered to give me their spot, but I stood here because I didn&#39;t want special treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood in line at the Bank of Tarteron. I needed to convert my funds to human money, so I wasn&#39;t completely broke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father below. Next.&#34; Said the vampyr, the end process of vampirism. When dead, those who please my uncle Xaxas transform into a bat shifter. They flap around and possess the stupid who fuck around with dark magic. They feed off the life essence of them to remain, though, this only happens to those not marked.. To banish them, most times something as simple as a &#39;bless you&#39; will ward off such spirit beasts, but it has to be meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For example, a halfhearted one from someone won&#39;t work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though unlike the powerful, this vampyr had no mortal form. She was a black bat, sitting on a little stool, though the ends of her wings had hands, so as she typed, it wasn&#39;t slow or awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m here to withdraw and convert my gold to US dollars.&#34; I said looking around for my ID. I had three of these things now. One for hell, one for humans, and another for supernatural stops. My wallet was getting fat with this kind of bullshit, as there&#39;s also paper documents that must be presented with stamps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up my information, and she asked a few more questions. &#34;Your highness, would you like to have it wire transferred for a hundred gold?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s better.&#34; I said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A week had passed since the repairs were started, and I wasn&#39;t *broke*, but my wallet stung.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to convert my money from gold to dollars. I didn&#39;t know how much it was worth, but each coin weighed an ounce, and I Doogled it before coming down here, one coin is worth 2 grand I&#39;d been paid 5 grand for the past 6 moons And almost all of it is going to fix the house, pay bills, and the mortgage on the house down here that I didn&#39;t know I had until I got the bill in the mail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have 60 million to convert. Would you like its entirety sent above?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I only need a million.&#34; I said calmly outwardly but on the inside I was flipping the Fuck Out! I was being paid That much to kill a few assholes?! If I wasn&#39;t born the wolf, and I had a human side I&#39;d be tempted to go to my home and go swim in that money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course sir.&#34; She said with a bow. She got my information, and she printed a receipt He paid me so much in mortal money, but down here, one gold was literally worth one dollar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Generals get a 200 acre plot outside the city, a farm, and a few retainers. I was paying a mortgage for it; I may as well see what it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two-story house looked like an old Victorian farmhouse. It was painted white, and the fields were already growing some crop, I think corn... It hadn&#39;t yet come up to tell, but the leaves were long and thick. Since everything from the dirt to the vegetables were black, the white house looked almost out of place. The second house was painted blue; it was for the servants. Two former mortals who I hadn&#39;t met yet were out there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They wore Roman robes, being two strapping young men. They didn&#39;t see me, and they were having a pretty good time, using the demonic, scaled ox to plow fields while they weeded. Time moves differently, so the 6 months I had this place was undoubtably much longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chompi hurry up!&#34; complained the taller one. The black haired man rode the mighty beast&#39;s back to steer him, while the stocker man pushed the plow. That male was the tanner of the two, but they were both pale. I recognized his accent, it was French, yet, something told me that he might not be from the one I knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;m ready to fucking clock out!&#34; said the other. His accent was Ausrailian, but I could tell he was also from a different world. The redhead seemed extra chipper about clocking out. &#34;I want to go see my girlfriend!&#34; He roared at the top of his human lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to be sat on by your girlfriend!&#34; Laughed the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;&#39;Ay! Fuck off tall, dark, and horny.&#34; The redhead laughed. &#34;I double dare you to ask her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not a chance in hell.&#34; He joked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waved, and they stopped what they were doing to come see me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do we owe the pleasure boss?&#34; Asked the Redhead. &#34;I&#39;m Ulfric, that&#39;s Leon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m the smart one.&#34; Leon said proudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re somethin&#39; alright.&#34; We all chuckled. I shook wrists with them. Even though I looked like this, they didn&#39;t hesitate to be cheerful. &#34;Both of us were killed by the Lord of Judgment we didn&#39;t do anything, but he ruled both our worlds die.&#34; Ulfric said still smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t outwardly seem upset about it, but he was bad enough of a liar that I could tell. All he knew was gone, and replaced with working for the nephew of the one who did it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want to take off, I don&#39;t mind as long as whatever you need to do gets done.&#34; I said about to leave, and they bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s really understandable sir.&#34; Said Ulfric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t really care. Grow what you like to eat, not what sells too. I have plenty of money, but I imagine you were ordered to grow crops to feed the city.&#34; I said leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went to my packhouse living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flora sat with Hercuilian and Diana. Their pup already had those strange teeth, and ate meat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Hi!/ he ran to hug my legs. Hillius was born because Diana got tired of being pregnant but he didn&#39;t know that. He was just a happy &#39;4-year-old&#39; kid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And born so fucking big. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s still healing from *that*..gods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be happy with the boys growing up so fast either. I enjoy them being little. I get a longer time with them being kids Plus they don&#39;t cry and scream; they squeak. If they screamed like children maybe I&#39;d be jealous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey lil&#39; guy.&#34; I said petting his head, and his father passed me a root beer. &#34;Are you enjoying yourself?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Yeh!/ He showed me the horse his father carved for him. Herculian had talent, as the horse looked very well made. It wasn&#39;t painted, because his son already had his powers of Contradiction. His ice burned, and his fire froze. Even in his little hands now, his blazing hands had the figure covered in frost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The strange patches in complexion were also already forming on his face, but he had a mother to lock his hair And he had a father to tell him he loved him. That was the difference that all our pups needed. We live too long, and our powers are too dangerous to be unaccounted or neglected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurculian also made figures for my sons, but he knew they would just destroy them like they were right now so They were blockier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Ass!] Barked Vex. They were tugging on a single one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Oooo he said a *bad* word!/ Tattled Hillius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Bad?] Asked Vex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes bad.&#34; I confirmed, and Vex looked upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brother now barked this new word to tease him and of course it made Vex squeak in protest. They were too young to really grasp the concept of &#39;bad&#39; but they knew it wasn&#39;t something they liked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked them both up and soothed them while their mother was out training. I would be her support during this. She wanted to get stronger, and learn about her powers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could sense how they really worked my mate, but she was toughing it out, taking training seriously. She took their words to heart, and I was pretty proud of her. She wanted to do this on her own, without me ever really saying anything to her about this. She wants to be the Luna the pack needs, the entirety of it, not just the cushy office bits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made sure though that her training partner was Elio, since all my greenhorns also needed training, and I knew he&#39;d be able to handle her should she find out some new ability by accident. It was almost comical seeing how drooled over they were. All Flora&#39;s children were young, &#39;hot&#39; men, and my female Warriors in training were single.</p>
