                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Horned One stood there while the boys climbed on his feet, but he didn&#39;t seem like he had the heart to pick them up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gwanpa!&#34; They both jumped on his legs, but he turned his gaze away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I cannot pick you up.&#34; Zuviel said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Up!&#34; Said Vex, and that was a word!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The anger and rage I felt wasn&#39;t warranted, not fully and now my sweet little mate will not speak to me she will not look my direction She does not want me until I have righted such events, so it *will* be done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas appeared holding Harmony, and she hugged his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why&#39;d y&#39;all kill Bagel?!&#34; She cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have the soul here and 10 pounds of gold as compensation any mortal who&#39;s dog I can&#39;t return will also win the lottery, or something that&#39;s about 10 thousand dollars or better in reimbursement.&#34; Said the Horned One.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like he was ashamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was something I don&#39;t think even he realized. They don&#39;t think like we do, Kaizen included. He doesn&#39;t see himself as a werewolf, and he calls all non-divine blood holders &#39;mortal&#39;. It doesn&#39;t bother me, because I know he&#39;s a demigod but it is strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s like that&#39;s the only time I actually see him as his title, when he either mentions it, or shows his powers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok&#34; Harmony sniffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have made so many tears, yet this is not what I wanted.&#34; He said looking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; The Horned One said more in confusion than anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Well What do *you* want? I know *I* won&#39;t be able to do anything personally, but maybe if you voice it, there can be resolution?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ironically enough I want a little Mercy myself after getting him killed.&#34; Huffed the Horned One. &#34;Thankfully he wasn&#39;t dead long enough to kill higher life, but all the dogs on every realm they died for about 2 seconds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Bagel didn&#39;t come back.&#34; Said Harmony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But she will now songbird.&#34; Said Xaxas. It was weird seeing him sweet, or loving like that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;m alright.&#34; she wiped her eyes. They left with the dog, and the Horned One sat on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least they aren&#39;t upset at me one day they might be though.&#34; He said with a sigh. &#34;Forgive this bitter fool little ones. Because of me, you will know flesh sooner than I would like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They will still remember fur. I know I&#39;m grateful.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;When I was a pup, it was fun to always run around, but it got harder to interact with the other pups, since I didn&#39;t have hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fair.&#34; Said the Horned One. &#34;I think I&#39;ll go home. My mate will never speak to me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said that, but she appeared and hugged him around his neck. &#34;I&#39;m sorry I slapped you and ruined your favorite robes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ok what did I miss?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those robes needed to be replaced at least [redacted] ago.&#34; He chuckled, though in my head I literally heard the word &#39;redacted&#39; not the years. &#34;I&#39;m sorry I let Humblon die. We should have whipped him or something. Something to make the other gods fear our wrath, but not this much lamentation across so many worlds There are many who couldn&#39;t be brought back&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As the Moon Goddess of all realms now. I know Zuviel you got so many killed that my realm is backed up too. This affected all his mortals even his full blooded angels. They fell from the skies</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great I&#39;ll have to Blood for Blood any troops lost with Arviel too, as Humblon is now the one owed...&#34; He mumbled. &#34;I assume they all got revived, yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They did, but unfortunately the flesh made mortals. Like the unicorns didn&#39;t. Some are officers, drivers, flight and ship captains They are so trusted that no one expected those who were affected, to pass out at the wheel, or die Instantly while a thousand feet in the air&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. I know.&#34; He said quietly. &#34;I will ensure all those souls get to be reborn and they must be compensated as well All this stemmed from letting lose my true nature for but a moment The pettiness of the King of Hell is greater than it should be but I would do this again. Now the gods tremble They know their place, even a king&#39;s brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They each held a pup, but they just wanted to nip. They wrestled the Horned One&#39;s hands, and Kaizen looked at them with a soft smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember that. Get &#39;um Ari.&#34; He grinned. They were *so* fierce pulling their grandpa&#39;s robes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rawr!&#34; Yipped Vex, and he got scooped up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re already cute. Stop it.&#34; Said the Horned One with a smile. &#34;Oh gods damn it.&#34; That smile disappeared with his Herold&#39;s giddy entrance. He was in robes now, looking as he does in Hell, but to keep this world protected, he can&#39;t touch the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Master.&#34; Sang Apythmenos, flapping to stay afloat. He poked the Horned One&#39;s shoulder, and got growled at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t.&#34; Zuviel warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Say it master.&#34; He sang. The poking intensified, and so did the annoyance of Zuviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I get a *little* peace??&#34; He growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Horned One Sighed. I could tell he did a spell to keep the sky blue</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apythmenos&#34; the Herold became covered in runes. My pups were placed in my hands... The Horned One took his hand and made a magical circle. It looked like a clear tablet screen was summoned, but I couldn&#39;t make out what he was typing. His fingers were so fast, you couldn&#39;t really see them. &#34;Wear your tail.&#34; He said and the Herold was struck by red lightning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside across the sky for a moment were pinkish scales. He was such a large Asian dragon that you couldn&#39;t see anything else, just the light of the streetlights and the runes on his body. For everyone else, they wouldn&#39;t see this surreal total eclipse To see someone so big makes me realize how small I am compared to all the cool stuff they do</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How big is He?!&#34; I took the pups outside to watch The Horned One fixed the smoldering floor. I was thankful that the sprinklers didn&#39;t come on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As big as I need him to be.&#34; He said disappearing. &#34;I can&#39;t put this off I have to fix this.&#34; The Horned One said on the wind, taking Noirnamu with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well that was cool.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;Want to go to the castle? Tyson said Grace is coming over with her pup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh that sounds fun; I&#39;ll get the boys a bath.&#34; I beamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. I can get the milk, toys, cherry spray, and pads.&#34; He vanished. &#34;Oh and grandma&#39;s gift...&#34; Kaizen vanished again after taking the cake off the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hurray.&#34; I said as my heart fell to my knees. I didn&#39;t notice that thing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And they can read minds so we can&#39;t throw it away!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were all a *little* traumatized by those pastries to say the least.!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Kaizen-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was thankful to all the gods that I marked Jerold&#39;s son and Flora&#39;s Everyone and everything that was made by the Lord of Mercy, Purity, and Unity passed out for a few seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like they were unplugged, but thankfully a few people only got hurt. Too many demigods live on Urth, and many of us, me included, were randomly teleported to the largest accidents before they happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Personally, I was randomly teleported to Indiya to stop a train.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Don&#39;t want to eat that.&#34; Said Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was suspicious of it, regardless of how good it smelled and looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean It&#39;s Food.&#34; I said with a grin. I teleported to our room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck it was a mess with all the toys on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let my little mate squirm if only for a little bit</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a little bad to do it, but if she was in on it, Grace and Tyson Will See Through Her Lies if I did spill it... We don&#39;t turn this power off. We were born with our powers, so it wasn&#39;t all that hard to just kind of stay a mild form of powered up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone like Alavastros, a half beast, might have trouble with his. He&#39;s the grandson of a Herold too, so one day he might be able to do way more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly that has me a little excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since he is claimed by me, grandfather is going to make him his own club. It will be one he can summon, like I can with my bow. It also seemed since I was a general, weapons and armor were being made. I know I won&#39;t fight on my homeworld, but I felt conflicted being excited about any of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those gifts are for destroying worlds after all But as I said with Humblon, I will take no joy from it as best as I can. I won&#39;t prolong it; there&#39;s no need. What example would I set for my kids? I&#39;m stuffing a baby bag for them, but they *will* be monsters. I have to make sure they&#39;re the right kind...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get back here!&#34; Yelled Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Wet!&#34; they both yipped, but I could tell they were giggling</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They chuffed little laughs running down the hall, because their mother&#39;s kitsune trainer is coming to us, since Willow didn&#39;t want to leave the country. I could drop her off and pick her up; the commute&#39;s only 3 seconds with cosmic interference, but she doesn&#39;t know Japanese, nor does she want to leave the pups so far away, and she doesn&#39;t know *how* to make the commute by herself yet.</p>
