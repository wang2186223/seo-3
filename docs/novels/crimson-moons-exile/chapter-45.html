                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held her close to my chest, shielding her from anything and everyone that was around us I had the self-control not to give into my base drive. I wanted to run away I wanted to leave this place and return to Misfit With my pardon and my power I could be the Alpha they needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held the Luna I needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome home.&#34; Said my mother, hugging me gently. &#34; I know you&#39;re a man now but I still remember when you were the first to growl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only visit mother. My home is somewhere else.&#34; I said letting her hug us. She was a strong woman, and I don&#39;t say I can rightly remember her crying much. Father had died when we were little, and she shed tears until he was revived back then. Those memories were fuzzy distorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. But since not a single tear was shed until today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not cry for your son mother I left a man child now I am a man.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry I didn&#39;t get Xaxas to come sooner. But even the Horned One commanded we stay out of it.&#34; Harmony looked like she wanted to hug me too, so I put Willow down on a pillow, and gave Nixxia, Grace, and her a gentle one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was healed of any physical bruising, but I ached my mind and body was tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. If I&#39;d have been pardoned immediately, without all this without training nor repentance, I would have learned nothing. They could have Stopped at any time. They did not have to try to bring in a mindless beast, but at the same time, I should have more control.&#34; I said lowly, but they all still looked and felt guilty. They held authority, but not enough to overrule the Horned One then later the Realm King Xaxas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their tears attracted the attention of my uncles and father, but this time they did not hold the auras of disgruntled gods Now the three felt like regular men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did well.&#34; Said Xaxas. He must have watched my final test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should you ever need to be ferried, I can take you.&#34; Said Uncle Asanguis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll need that favor anytime soon, but thank you.&#34; I said returning his smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take her to my room.&#34; I said knowing that she was in Tarteron. I knew this body was a shell, and she would return to me soon. I knew those things because I stopped to think rather than jump to conclusions or panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you walk your own path, son, know that I allow you three to find your own ways.&#34; Father said stoically. &#34;And know that if you wish to return to OpalMoon any who did have a grudge have left, most forgave you though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandmother showed me that.&#34; I said taking my mate upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They gave me room and I walked slowly with her. When I got to the guest room I could feel the blood drip from my eyes I put Willow on the bed, and lit a candle for her, not thinking of myself. It served no real purpose, other than the nice scent to hopefully cover my wolfish, demonic odor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck I smelled like Rogue, demon, wolf, and blood</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandfather I know you will return her.&#34; I said this silently, that I do not wake her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. I went to flush out my eyes. I looked in the bathroom mirror, the whites of them were a proper black, not tinged coffee brown.  The red of my irises were a rich crimson</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shower felt nice, and when I got out, I put on some sweats. I didn&#39;t know what time it was, and on Willow&#39;s phone it said that it was 1:08am.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyson knocked on my door. I knew it was him. I just knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother.&#34; He said seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the door. He was alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to-&#34; I cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother I hold no grudge. You come to apologize, to see if we are square. We are.&#34; I said pressing my horns to his I let him see. It was something I learned how to do in Hell something grandfather asked of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34; He asked in Royal Demonic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A single day.&#34; I said seeing Grace. She likely scented his arrival, since the Prince and Princess floor is shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also pressed my horns to hers,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have no right to the secrets you learned.&#34; She said in Royal Demon, the highest form of it, spoken only by high lords who ruled entire layers, and Zuviel&#39;s generals</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I share this that you two never do what I did But also I wanted you to see for yourself that the wrong was righted. May we be brothers and sister again. We don&#39;t need a special bond to link us together, our blood already does this.&#34; I said in English. They were a little overwhelmed, but now their eyes matched mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. Now they could turn their mindlessness on if they NEEDED it not just whenever something stressful happens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They shared their trials and tribulations as well Grace had to deal with being accepted as a different species, while Tyson tried so hard to establish himself as a righteous King</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you take over OpalMoon?&#34; Asked Tyson. He saw my thoughts, memories, and penance. He Knew the reason, but he asked anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Though they forgive me, I have still as of yet to forgive myself. I have many abandoned, discarded wolves as it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come with me to release your charges.&#34; He said referring to Jack, Ace and Gilbert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m surprised Ronitus has not spoken to Gilbert yet.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already linked him to meet me in the dungeon. Where did you find an Earthen Lycan?&#34; He asked. As far as we knew, he was the only one of his kind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Misfit. He was attracted to it because of me.&#34; I said casually</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could have come back and behave bitterly. It would have been my right, but I applied Ludvic&#39;s words to my own life. I would not attend any royal events anytime soon, but I would be in touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Willow----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think we should give her some time.&#34; Said the Moon Goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My lovely, I will not do that, not for longer than an hour or two. Her body is still on Urth.&#34; He said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That probably meant that if I didn&#39;t pick... I&#39;d be stuck here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is correct.&#34; He said kingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to spend more time with her.&#34; She complained quietly. I don&#39;t think I was meant to hear her, so I pretended I didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You had Grace. I shall handle the mortal.&#34; He said leaning in to whisper something in her ear, but her skin color changed to like a whiteish silver. She looked more like the moon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can agree to those terms my lord.&#34; She said changing skin colors again. This time she had dark skin and her hair was yellowish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not see this as a sentence.&#34; He said with a soft smile. &#34;I cannot keep you long, as you are alive. It will not hurt; I have molded and shaped souls for longer than you could fathom.&#34; He said cracking his knuckles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um&#34; I paused. &#34;I like the idea of being something I know about I don&#39;t want to be a vampire They are too cruel Demons are scary I also feel like their cruelty is too much. Anyone that isn&#39;t marked by you is fair game. Werewolves are split souled I think I don&#39;t want that either. Witches and elves, and other magic casters are so snobbish and conceited They think less of shifters, and I don&#39;t like that I would belong to a people who think like that I also don&#39;t like the idea of being a minotaur or other half beast, because their mindlessness is like flipping a coin and Kaizen worked too hard for that to be a problem again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So?&#34; He said with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I become a horned wolf. will I become mindless and attack people?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;Whatever you pick, I would strip that from your being, as you would be weak, and only get yourself hurt Would you mind indulging this old man little soul? I believe I have an idea. If you don&#39;t like it, I can always make you an Omega. Then you won&#39;t have powers, but I know you would hate to remain powerless. I&#39;ll make you a normal werewolf without a wolf should you not like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;King of Night I humbly accept whatever form you wish to make with the Moon Goddess&#39;s approval.&#34; I said seeing him nod.</p>
