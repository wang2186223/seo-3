                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me stupidly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They chose to leave sir!&#34; He begged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After you Beat an Omega with Warrior Grade Whips. I saw the memories on their souls myself because she was too scared of you to even fucking say it out loud!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was silent a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn.Is Willard alright?&#34; He asked this genuinely. He didn&#39;t realize his actions would put pack in danger. &#34;But I didn&#39;t *beat* them. They&#39;re just soft.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But that doesn&#39;t fucking matter!&#34; I yelled. &#34;She&#39;s still an Omega She&#39;s still no stronger than a human; they can&#39;t handle that kind of punishment. You&#39;re a Fool to think her *mate* wouldn&#39;t pack their shit and try the wild.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know I fucking know. GreenMart&#39;s a mess now.&#34; He mumbled. &#34;Willie&#39;s only a Kappa, but he was a good butcher, and even better manager I could trust him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he&#39;s only about as big as Grandma Eclipse shit he&#39;s small He didn&#39;t stand a *Chance* with Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should have double checked.&#34; Said his mate. &#34;. This isn&#39;t good for our pup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took two sniffs. &#34;Your pup.&#34; I corrected. How did he not smell her mate on her? I guess the heavy perfume? Good thing I can out supernatural bullshit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. So you were still seeing Archy.&#34; He mumbled. &#34;To be fair I did hook up with my mate too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he wanted his mate, he should have mated AND MARKED her not All This.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was supposed to fire and reprimand his Omegas with a little prison time. Maybe banishment if it was something expensive like Blowing Up My Hellcat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So wherever she is she&#39;s pregnant too. Same price as Gloria&#39;s pup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We make planes my prince. I can afford it.&#34; He mumbled. &#34;But I can&#39;t afford the heartbreak I&#39;m about to endure. Heartbreak I earned all on my own.&#34; He sighed, looking at his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye.&#34; As much as I don&#39;t like him as a person rejection Hurts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Reeta&#39;s out there with my pupShe&#39;s two months along and my dumbass couldn&#39;t scent itAnd *I* let You haze her to leave but I couldn&#39;t let her goReeta didn&#39;t even reject me back. Well Yet, I imagine she will before tonight&#39;s over&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby-&#34; Her attempt to sooth him was thwarted by him taking a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was heartbroken. He chose a Mark mate over his true like a Fool, and got played.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up. You wanted to have your cake and eat it too so did I&#34; He punched the window in his office, disgusted with his own reflection. But his thoughts weren&#39;t specific on what Tyna did to MAKE Reeta leave Tonight &#34;We&#39;re done I want you and your mate gone by sunrise. Your lot, pup included, are banished. Go fuck Archy somewhere else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That is his right. Here he is Alpha, and I will not take them in I already house Reeta and Gloria but I know they both blame her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I cannot accept you; Gloria will kill you, but more importantly, you will not make trouble for my mate.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow is a good Luna, but that&#39;s walking drama. No one will want them but these days GreenMoon applicants get turned down because of his reputation. That&#39;s what happens when you get shitty Alphas what we do reflects on them, just as what they do reflects on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand sire.&#34; She said leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good call.&#34; Said Grandfather, a little proud that I wasn&#39;t a bleeding heart. Why the Fuck would I be?! Those little shits make problems everywhere they go!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That family was sliced up pretty good by Jack the Slasher.&#34; I said glaring at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my Gods!&#34; His eyes bugged out in Horror. &#34;. Jack the *Fucking* Slasher ?!&#34; He glared at the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard he&#39;s killed enough people to become and Old One.&#34; Said grandfather. &#34;Jack the Slashing One.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wholeheartedly believe that I&#39;ve engaged that Rogue before. No unranked wolf could survive an attack like that. He walks through Fucking Walls! And I Killed him Because Of Ty-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re *alive*, but he&#39;ll never walk right again. Who do you think he&#39;s going to blame the rest of his immortal life?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me sir.&#34; He said firmly, like a man to another man. &#34;The reputation of GreenMoon is consistently tarnished by *me*.. I can get mad at Reeta, Gloria, or Tina all I want. But I&#39;m Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. And *you&#39;re* responsible for the medical bills and surgeries *I had to pay for.* A cool 200k. Had you not made them leave with your cruelty, they would have Never been out there.&#34; They wouldn&#39;t have stolen my car either, but that&#39;s petty, so I won&#39;t mention it. I have a feeling insurance won&#39;t pay up either but to be fair that damn car had NO room for pups. &#34;She praised your pack management, even holding scars from such soft skin being lashed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He used an Alpha&#39;s whip on an Omega. Not illegal, but I did shoot Tyson a text.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>321.And Pissed Off King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He appeared directly behind him, snorting fire, smelling of brimstone. I held my laugh. To me, his screams were hilarious, just deserts for being incompetent, petty, and childish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What The Fuck is he doing to Omegas?&#34; Hissed Tyson. His soft spot for the weak might get Alpha Green Killed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You saw.&#34; I motioned him. &#34;Explain to your king why you beat them, and why you let your mark mate haze your true So harshlyJust a Hair from breaking the law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*now he was scared.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be honest. We both hear your buzzing.&#34; I said with a glare. He was going to blame Gloria too it&#39;s what he&#39;d probably told the pack since he started losing his temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And packs follow their Alpha&#39;s lead, so the pack likely blames her too, even if they know better. That&#39;s what they&#39;ll say, since it&#39;s the acceptable explanation. Most times, they agree with us, even when they don&#39;t because this isn&#39;t a democracy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There isn&#39;t a vote.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There Isn&#39;t a way to challenge unless they&#39;re ready to take it outside so it&#39;s safer to nod, bow, and roll over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.I was Pissed Ok! Is that what you want to hear?!&#34; He asked, and Tyson slapped him. He slapped him hard enough to knock him right on his ass. A taste stronger and he&#39;d probably be passed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to hear the Truth.&#34; He hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was pissed more at myself and how all this played out If I&#39;d have just accepted my mate, none of this would&#39;ve happened.  I could have had Two blessed pups from my Mate.Right about now, she&#39;d be making dinner She made me a sandwich once just stupid deli meat&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And nothing could compare.&#34; I said in understanding The bond break hurts mentally and physically. We left him alone a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let him grieve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rejecting your mate, in my opinion, is almost like fucking cursing yourself There is Only One. And to deny it, is to be eternally wanting for it as an immortal. A thousand years can pass, and he will still feel like this was yesterdayforever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He will never see his mate&#39;s smile He will never know his pups unless he comes to visit, which I doubt since it&#39;s so awkward. He will never know how nice it is just to wake up, and she&#39;s right there with the kids, and it&#39;s your turn to take them to the toilet, bathe them, and brush their teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He will never know what it feels like for the mundane to feel as magic never see his pups grow to be men, to be with them their first kill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of my closest, fondest memories his children won&#39;t get. Bastards in our culture don&#39;t happen often so it is looked Down on harshly. Those women will be judged and shunned as harlot pack breakers. Alpha ruiners, when it&#39;s Him who&#39;s the Problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should gut his ass right now. Flay &#39;em while he&#39;s still breathing. It would be easy, much easier to be a monster than a prince any day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, and she&#39;ll probably fit on the playpen floor. I finally got to see why Reeta fled for her life. That Dirty Bitch beat her within an inch of her life, knowing she was with pup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the fuck could Reeta do? She has no power and what power she was supposed to have, Green didn&#39;t provide... He didn&#39;t know details, but I know he felt that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A white scroll appeared in my hands with the Moon on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I burned it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have been barred from flaying them. Tyson too He has no idea how his goddess has saved his worthless pelt. I&#39;ve been wanting a floor rug for the office, and he&#39;s a light enough shade to dye cobalt blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Green realized all that now. His wolf took over, and cried bitter tears on his knees. Gabble, I felt sorry for. The wolf isn&#39;t in control, merely a passengerHe had to watch this play out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It makes me thankful there is no human side to me This is a lot of power and authority to hold, too much to be corrupt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\[It is all his fault.\] Gabble whined, losing his form, laying on his side as if he&#39;d been stabbed in the heart. The bond thread snappedShe&#39;d finally rejected him back. Alpha Green&#39;s wolf was so hurt as he lay there But he did this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nobody made him reject his mate. He did that part all on his own.&#34; Said Tyson. In the eyes of the Wolf King, he deserved no pity. &#34;Nobody made him get Gloria pregnant, or make Tyna Luna when she Shouldn&#39;t have been. Nobody told him to reject and badmouth his mate because she was an Omega. And YOU allowed Tyna to punish her for Nothing. You Knew she was &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need to find Reeta now that I think of it. She&#39;s an Omega, so her wolf&#39;s dormant but I know this still hurts. The bond break affects them both. Green&#39;s wolf still didn&#39;t give him back control His instinct was to go make this right somehow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it&#39;s too late for that. The bond&#39;s snapped that&#39;s It.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was done by grandmother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That you break my grandmother&#39;s heart yet she still protects you lot.&#34; I growled. I don&#39;t know if that was even proper English. I don&#39;t care. I wanted to punch him I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t hold myself back right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they got together now, they&#39;d basically be mark mates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\[I told him to take her that the Goddess does not make mistakesI told him now we have *nothing* like I saidJust like I said.\] Gabble screamed on his side on the floor like  Like a Dog? It kind of took away from how fucked up this was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/. Why does he sound like a Husky?/ I linked. Like a WeTube Short like huskies when they don&#39;t have their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\[This is my fault!! \] He wailed Alpha Green did it again. I Was right, but his pack members thought we were monsters because he were chuckling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Yeah! Remember the video grandpa Kaiden sent? When Bagel had the temper-tantrum?/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laid in the tub and complained because it wasn&#39;t bathtime yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made Tyson chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/I hear it too. Wa-Wa-Wa/ He linked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/You&#39;re a dick./ I linked back with a grin. /Wa-wa-wa is gonna be a thing now. I&#39;m doing it./</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/He did this to himself. Boo-fuckin&#39;-hoo./ He rolled his eyes. Tyson outright laughed. /Wa-wa-wa./</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandfather left. He&#39;s a god who holds a mate, one that was imprisoned. It was a little much for the Horned One, and that&#39;s saying something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He will never know the touch of his mate ever again. Something I cannot risk with Willow.</p>
