                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran like I did a few nights ago. Before all this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wolves don&#39;t feel &#39;Affection&#39; for anyone other than close family and their mate. But I always thought it took a while</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen holy crap!&#34; She yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I galloped, jumping over enormous logs, taking a trail that led to a stream. I jumped turning us into lightning if only for a moment to completely clear the small, almost river and she screamed louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OH MY GOD!&#34; She said holding on tight. &#34;THAT&#39;S SO FLIPPIN&#39; COOL BUT PLEASE DON&#39;T EVER DO THAT AGAIN!!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed by chuffing, but I don&#39;t think she knew what that was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wished she could understand me. I wished she knew that I could &#39;technically&#39; fly with that ability.  But instead, I spoke to her with the scenery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that I was on the other side of the water, I let my paws dig into the large flat rocks. I could tell she looked around in wonder. This place was a small piece of the country, preserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chestnut trees here were as big around as redwoods, still saved from the event that killed off a large part of the forests when they all got sick Trees this big used to be common. It was even said that humans could fit a whole house inside but all that is gone outside little groves like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That and the various packs of all supernaturals. All of us, every single kind who didn&#39;t need to live in cities, maintained their lands. The howling of the others made me howl back. I don&#39;t even know Why. Where I was headed, they could not come I was beyond whatever crime they committed to be out here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was our nature, and just as it was mine to howl, it was there&#39;s to come. I attracted nearly every visitor of the grove; some were not even wolves.  They bowed, and I nodded my head. Regardless of my position, my blood would never change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow&#34; Whispered Willow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my head and shoulders down, getting her off me with a small shake. She was so small, it was all it took, and she smiled. I felt a certain pride from it it was like an arrow to the heart, if only for a moment between heartbeats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her scent is the only scent that&#39;s EVER made me froth at the mouth the only touch that gave a tinglethe sparks everyone talks about. And that I am literally here because I saved her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any other mortal, I would have shifted and joined them. I enjoyed ripping off limbs first that they die slower. Father always said that was the Adversary&#39;s blood in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your majesty.&#34; Bowed the &#39;leader&#39; of the Rogue band. I was so lost in thought when had they bowed? How long were they in front of me? He was human formed to show respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[I am not my older brother.] I said simply, shifting now that she was off my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Lord Kaizen. there are Few who do not know of your grace&#34; Mumbled the tallest of the bunch. &#34;Name&#39;s Ace. I request becoming an addition to your war band.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like a cocky nearly blood red furred wolf, while his Beta was black furred, and the other was blonde. I could hear his thoughts. He didn&#39;t want me to know his last name was Grisham His soul&#39;s name said Brutos Grisham though odd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was not Brutus with a &#39;U&#39; but it did sound like someone possibly tried to Groom him to behave as his grandfather Fuck, I&#39;d run away too. He scented to be close to my age. So he had to know. The crimes Brutus committed were so vastincluding pup killing for political gain I had no doubt the former Wolf Council member was in Hell as my grandfather&#39;s personal guest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell would have been a kindness Brutus, the Untrue Third Seat stole his place at the Wolf King&#39;s left by betraying his Alpha, Phillip the Frosted One, the White Wolf his mate was human. And she was targeted while with pup. Everyone knew about that for Centuries, but could do nothing, as part of the deal Brutus made, was to get the Third Seat, and be protected from punishment. With Phillip&#39;s mate as a hostage, the King agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then my father killed him, skinned him, and sent his pelt to Phillip. Retribution for causing the White Wolf to be an exile. My mother took the Third Seat afterwards because Phillip didn&#39;t want it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I could see why a direct descendant of someone like Brutus would drop their real name, and run away and hide it as best as he could. Any with Council rank would know of his family bloodline, and might kill him as a threat. He Certainly wouldn&#39;t be welcome in any packs</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We wish to be pack great Alpha.&#34; Said the black furred one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His soul held the red X of sinonly instead of RED like it was supposed to be. It was inky black. He&#39;d killed so many that I Knew he was going to hell for murder.  That it was black meant he was unredeemable He was about 4 thousand years old I could scent that. But I could also see he hid the true wild, crazed nature behind contacts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blonde was silent, though he was an innocent. Whatever he&#39;d done wasn&#39;t so bad that it branded his soul...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s higher than an Alpha. Jack, he is his highness son of the Pale Lady&#39;s Actual son&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They kneeled as low as they could, being the only wolves brave enough to come so close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Denied. All of you may find pack, or remain Rogues, but none may follow my trail.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked her up bridal style, and I glared back. They did not follow it would be Selfish to have anyone with me other than her she was My burden, since it was I who vowed to keep her safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you not want to join their pack?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because when I&#39;m caught, I&#39;ll likely be beheaded. I don&#39;t want to drag anyone else down with me.&#34; I grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What would happen to me?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re my mate. I would only allow this if I ever lost you.&#34; I told her firmly. &#34;My intention is to give you this life. You have more than my word Willow, you hold half my soul in the palm of your hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart felt light, I&#39;d confessed my feelings, but my soul was pained To mark me it was to love a man marked for death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Willow----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said nothing when he told me that &#39;I was his life.&#39; I looked at the green grass it looked like a carpet under the lush, thick tree canopy. &#39;I held half his soul.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want you to die.&#34; I said, feeling my cheeks wet. I hugged his chest. I didn&#39;t care he was naked he rubbed my back while I felt like a child. Why was I so attached to him? The mate bond. I knew the answer the connection between us was so strong, I swear I could almost see a thin red cord connecting our hearts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t until you do.&#34; He said as if he were talking about the weather He wiped my face, and I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s almost like you&#39;re not afraid of death.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be fair, he Is my uncle.&#34; He said with a smirk. He saw me look at his cock again It was a distraction. He shimmied on pants. I don&#39;t know where he got them, but I think he&#39;d put them in his mouth when we left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re joking.&#34; I said with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not.&#34; He looked like he was telling the truth but that was a little hard to believe</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s kind of neat.&#34; I mumbled, still not believing it, but I&#39;d leave well enough alone. The other werewolves treated him with the upmost veneration. But I didn&#39;t know Asanguis had brothers with an &#39;s&#39; or nephews</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve heard of Asanguis right?&#34; He said with a small smile.  I nodded&#34;The All King is my uncle, my father is his brother, thus, the Lord of Death is Also my uncle, since all three of them are full blooded brothers.&#34; He said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But in mythology, Asanguis and Xaxas were gods, fallen from grace, cursed to be down here while they look for the key to the moon Goddess&#39;s prison.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me blankly, as if saying their names so casually was a crime I committed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now how would you know That much?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went to private college. I also teach at St. Gabriel&#39;s Cathedral of the Light or I used to...&#34; I said with a sheepish smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah but they are not teaching anything new grandmother is Free, and there is Peace now. I can only assume they didn&#39;t want to change lore since they are a Church.&#34; He said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But something didn&#39;t quite add up if They, and the Horned One were real...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, the Lord of Light is Also Real and most of the mythos of this world lives and breathes above our heads. They don&#39;t usually involve themselves in what we do though.&#34; He said rubbing my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke so casually about it, like this was a Normal thing to say. &#34;I understand if you need to go lie down For fear of your mental wellbeing It&#39;s probably best not to get into that stuff yet&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I just didn&#39;t put two and two together.&#34; I said letting that go. I figured it&#39;s better that I still think of it all as hypothetical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that I wasn&#39;t on him it was Cold. He put his arms around me I was a little shy about it though He hadn&#39;t put on his shirt yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to talk to you.&#34; He said suddenly. &#34;I figure out here is better than in the village.&#34;  He grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to talk to you too&#34; I admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did this give me butterflies. They danced and I was nervous, the good kind. I watched him pick up branches as thick as my leg, and snap them with no effort. He put rocks in a circle, and put his hand on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To a normal person that would be a little jarring but for me, it almost felt like there was a certain pride I felt for his strength</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grass and everything around the stones was Gone all it took was his touch, and the ground was singed. He lit a fire with his grip, and found a tree log to place in front of the fire to make a quick two person seat. To be honest, I&#39;d rather be out here than with the uptight people in the village</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was suddenly sat down and pressed to his chest His heart beat as fast as mine.</p>
