                <p>A/N: It&#39;s getting to the end yall! Worry not! The Horned King (Tyson&#39;s book) is out, and the Bull&#39;s Beloved (Jerold) is already greenlit. Expect that one to just pop up soon if it hasn&#39;t already! Oh, and I will pick back up my regular Wed-Sun schedule this week!! Insurance denied my reinstatement claim, and the appeal, so I&#39;m just up shit creek until Obamacare enrollment. I&#39;ve slowed down writing partly because I have too many projects, and partly that I didn&#39;t like my work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More tea Herold?&#34; I asked Apythmenos, who sat in the living room with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;ll have a coffee this time.&#34; He got up, and got a cup for himself. There was a pot already made, seeing as how werewolves run off the stuff. He came and sat back down, while Yuka passed me a paper cup of black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Warrior Yuka.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Luna. I laughed when Alpha asked. Be careful, they said It&#39;s supposed to rain, but I don&#39;t know exactly what that means with everything tinted red.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean Today *would be* nice if not for the ominous reddish-brown sky Just do patrol until the clouds come in; after that send everyone inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good idea Luna.&#34; He said leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was saturated in the single spectrum of light. Red With Second Sight, I could see the occasional demon, since the Horned One&#39;s anger was so thick that his gaze on this world was actually hurting it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Lord of Light, nor Lia interfered. It didn&#39;t hurt her anymore if this world got banged up, so they thought it best not to do anything unless they had to. The Night and Light Courts are not, nor will ever be on *true* good terms. They only play nice and make peace to maintain order, and prevent war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noirnamu was on the floor with the boys, showing them how to use blocks. However, at the moment, they were more interested in burning the wood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very good littlest master.&#34; Said Noirnamu. &#34;This is a Bee.&#34; He pointed to the little image of a bee buzzing around the letter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[B.] Said Vex</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it makes the [Bah] sound.&#34; He said in I think demon that *wasn&#39;t* regular wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t teach them demonic yet dear.&#34; Said Apythmenos. I wasn&#39;t supposed to say his name out loud, as it is a curse or spell or something. I was warned and I just made a mental note that his name is &#39;Herold&#39;, not &#39;The Herald of the End: The Pit Given Form&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apythmenos didn&#39;t get off scot-free either &#39;Herold&#39; sipped his tea sitting across from me. I believe he was whipped for knowing. Since he wore normal clothes, not robes at the moment, you could kind of see lines on his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, his husband got none. I could tell. The human form of Noirnamu is pretty interesting The parts where he has black fur is instead chocolate skin, though the skull head is paler than me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also has no eyes just blue dots. So, he isn&#39;t fooling anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was told that they technically couldn&#39;t be here at the same time, though the Horned One still had the sky a dusty grayish red-orange. Even at night. For those with second sight, they could see the winged demons flying around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drama of the wool being pulled over the Horned One&#39;s eyes. *kinda* blew over but I had to admit, it took a few days to even be *this* gray skyed I was told the gray will become blue eventually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a week, the sky was a dusty red, and the Pit hid here. Not as red as it was years ago before I was born, when &#39;a meteor got too close to the planet&#39;, but there wasn&#39;t a single blue spot in the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like when Xaxas claimed Harmony, the public was lied to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were told a volcanic eruption is tinting the sky with its ash.Xaxas even made an actual eruption of Hawaiyee&#39;s Monta Loah the largest active volcano on the planet</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lot of people are being displaced for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s either they&#39;re displaced, or I accidently kill the planet by being here.&#34; Said the Herold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you should go home!&#34; I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I go home, he&#39;s going to shove me up my own ass.&#34; Said Apythmenos. &#34;Plus I&#39;m eating as much of Hell&#39;s energy as I can.&#34; He said that more as a complaint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if the pit&#39;s down, I&#39;m off. Paid overtime.&#34; Noirnamu fist bumped his husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Bah!] Yelled Vex, and gods damn it there was fire behind that little cute noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I JUST got them to stop toasting everything!&#34; I complained, putting out the new couch &#34;No!&#34; I said gently, but firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[. Me bad?] Vex asked so sad I held him close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Bad!] Yelled Ari. He wagged his little tail while my tiny ham cried a storm. [Bad mama! Vex Bad!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! You&#39;re my good boy but no fire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Hot.] Said Ari He *Was* paying attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scooped him up too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My smart little boys!&#34; I said happily I don&#39;t think they fully understood what was happening but I was getting to them. &#34;And you aren&#39;t bad. You&#39;re my *good boys*&#34; I said and I swear any conversations kind of stopped. They wagged their little tails so hard, they may as well fly away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone stared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do I like that so much?&#34; Asked Kaizen behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Bad!] They both shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; Kaizen said sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re my good boy too.&#34; I said grabbing his right horn, and he became mush. I pet him on the sides of his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[No! Mama BAD!] Said Vex, panicking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[No!] Yelled Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember this. Come here lil&#39; ones.&#34; He was handed the boys while I rubbed his temples, careful not to touch the horns again. &#34;You&#39;re papa likes it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nwoah! Brad!&#34; Barked Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now we all looked at the little one He spoke English</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that&#39;s new&#34; Kaizen sat up. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;nNNWoah!&#34; Said Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NW-nw-no!&#34; Said Vex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I&#39;ll be damned.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.You already are.&#34; Said Norinamu.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a mortal saying dear.&#34; Said Apythmenos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This changes things too.&#34; Said Kaizen. &#34;They might get mortal forms with all the hellish energy outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; It&#39;s rare the master changes plans. I&#39;ll send a scroll down.&#34; The Herold snapped his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll deliver it he&#39;s the least pissed at me.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I want to.&#34; I blurted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Abso-Fucking-Lutely *NOT.*&#34; Growled my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The master&#39;s partial to females. He won&#39;t harm her.&#34; Said Noirnamu. &#34;The more mortal the better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still don&#39;t like it.&#34; Growled Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I want *my* big adventure.&#34; I stomped my foot, not knowing that the Horned One would yank me below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Child you have my attention.&#34; He said glaring at me from atop his throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dear, don&#39;t be mad at her She did nothing.&#34; Said the Moon Goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My children spoke English!&#34; I blurted, and he stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?! Oh Come ON! I Can&#39;t Even Be Upset!&#34; He boomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zuzu&#34; She stood and put her gentle hands on his flaming balled fists. The flames disappeared. &#34;Why don&#39;t you want them speaking mortal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because they are not *ready*.&#34; He huffed. &#34;I had *specific* plans for their development, and all of it&#39;s out the window now.&#34; He roared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. but then you could speed up the other plans?&#34; Said the Moon Goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want that eitherThey don&#39;t yet fully understand the world around them They are small only 3 pounds each&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh they&#39;re only about 2 pounds.&#34; I said and he looked surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. They fit in my hand Lulliba. I did not want to harm our little ones.&#34; He said the last part calmly. &#34;If you wish to leave now in your fear mortal here&#39;s a portal. My magic will turn you inside-out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glowing red portal led to the living room, but instead of leaving, I put my head in. &#34;Pass me the pups.&#34; I said, and they were put in my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held them, and as I walked, I could see his anger turn to concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not give them to me.&#34; He warned. &#34;I may kill them on accident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I handed them to the Moon Goddess</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re both a little too hot.&#34; She said petting them, and her hands glowed. &#34;That should do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did this.&#34; He said resting his cheek on his knuckles. &#34;I can only assume the others are getting sick as well.&#34; He waved his hand. &#34;The sky should be blue now I left no permanent harm to anyone thanks to you little vixen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anytime But I didn&#39;t actually do anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did. You took the flames from the King of Hell. That is not something done so easily.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;They&#39;ll get their forms at 5. That&#39;s my fuck up.&#34; He sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked and I was home My big adventure didn&#39;t really *feel* big, but my actions changed the color of the flip-flappin&#39; sky. That has to count for something!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, you *only* went to hell. Lame.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boring.&#34; Sang Eternya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck both of you.&#34; I glared, but I shouldn&#39;t swear around babies</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuc.&#34; Babbled Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen burst into laughter. &#34;You&#39;re teaching them bad words, like Shit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop!&#34; I complained. We&#39;d *just* got them to stop that, and now here we go again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SheeTTt!&#34; yelled Vex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ass.&#34; &#34;Ari yipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh gods damn it.&#34; I facepalmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop teaching my boys potty mouths.&#34; Said the Horned One behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apythmenos Screamed. &#34;Master!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down. I came to see what fruit is reaped from my anger.&#34; He sighed again. &#34;I almost fucked this world. A hair longer and a portal there would have opened up in the sky.&#34; He pointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m surprised Arviel isn&#39;t down here.&#34; Said the Herold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With Lia no longer tethered here, she does not care.&#34; He said rolling his eyes. &#34;But I am owed this world compensation, and I do not make ill on my debts.&#34;</p>
