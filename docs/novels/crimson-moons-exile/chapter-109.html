                <p>A/n: I feel like I need to put a disclaimer here I made a Messed Up world. A world where men really do have all the power, and women&#39;s power is mostly through their men. I won&#39;t sugar coat it, but nothing graphic is described or anything, it&#39;s just a messed up situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat cross legged, in his robes, and the scythe disappeared. The grass around him died in a perfect circle, and mushrooms sprouted from the death. In the center was his symbol, and I had a feeling the grass would never grow here again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here.&#34; He leaned forward with open arms. They gummed his hands. &#34;We care because there are so few of us  Why would Arviel care of another bastard? He has at least one on nearly every world and our mortal mates influence we princes more than I like to admit and mother is as sweet as honey, but a &#39;hi&#39; would have been nice.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nice to see you.&#34; I said a little sheepishly. They were unaffected by his powers, but I figured that from the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nice to see you too. I figured while I was in the area, I&#39;d stop by.&#34; He smiled. He let them run around him, well wiggle. It was only walking speed but there was real progress. They were putting their feet under themselves more now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who did you come for?&#34; I asked. He was dressed as the Reaper so he had to have been on the job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The 4th Seat of the Goblins. That one poisoned him last night, but he should die in about 20 minutes or so.&#34; He said pointing to Jack. &#34;After this I have the Alpha of DustMoon, he loses his fight with a Rogue, a beggar in New Apple, that one&#39;s going to be *fun*.&#34; He smiled. &#34;There&#39;s others too but they don&#39;t need reaping unless they don&#39;t move on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Ok why is the beggar death fun, and do you reap everybody?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mind taking you 3 with me for that one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll pass.&#34; I said as he chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get to topple a building. Death happens with or without me. My job is to exist so death is possible, and collect particularly violent ones. I also collect the wayward. Unlike others in the pantheon, there are no copies of me. There aren&#39;t any  copies of my brothers either. I am the Lord of Death for every world. It&#39;s as taxing as it sounds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>----Kaizen ----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gossip about the town among all the unicorns, was that Arviel made the Earth Goddess his mate as an apology. I honestly didn&#39;t care so long as they were happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mate was at the park with the boys. I could also sense Asanguis; he&#39;d been around since about sunrise. I figured the outing would be good for her, and I wasn&#39;t worried with Jack and Ink &#39;Luna sitting&#39;. I didn&#39;t eat any cake, so I was fine. But she still looked a little green this morning. Now it was noon, and I had to finish up today&#39;s interviews if I wanted to spend any daylight with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s the one we caught driving through the gate as if she had an invitation.&#34; Snarled Warrior Yuka. It was disrespectful that she didn&#39;t stop and wait for escorts</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I silenced their grumbling with a nose snort. I wasn&#39;t in the mood for ankle nipping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind the new she wolf were two of my Warriors. They caught her this morning, and she looked as if she had nothing to hide. She was a healthy, though heavily pregnant she wolf, about 4 months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was passed her information. She was from GreenMoon quite a ways away in the northern middle of the country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew she could definitely do border patrol if her information checked out. . It said her wolf&#39;s eyes were orange, the highest color most non-royal wolves can be born with. She was also 6&#39;5, rare for a female. Gloria was 52, brunette and dark skinned. Other than her record, she could find a place here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have a seat, Gloria.&#34; I said pointing to a chair. She sat and I called her former Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Frank Green speaking.&#34; He sounded short tempered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is Alpha Kaizen, the Horned Wolf of Misfit. I have one of your wolves.&#34; I said pulling up the female. &#34;A Gloria Harbor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can have *her* your highness.&#34; He said with a groan, &#34;She makes too much trouble.&#34; He complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was then that the she wolf looked nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Explain.&#34; I said glaring at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She claimed she got pregnant by me.&#34; He said with a snort before she could say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am!&#34; She countered. &#34;I left before you could &#39;tie up loose ends&#39;.&#34; She growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He growled at her, and I growled for them both to shut up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is pregnant.&#34; I said a little agitated. &#34;If you laid hands on this woman, you may as well fess up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was a one-night fling One that *she initiated behind my mark mate&#39;s back*!&#34; He growled. &#34;It was the full moon, and-&#34; I cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not give a fuck. I wouldn&#39;t let him make it out like this was all JUST her fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take in the she wolf, but I will give Ms. Harbor justice.&#34; I said writing up the proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a normal Alpha, I&#39;d have to take this to a lower council court, though as a Horned Wolf, and brother of the King, I would abuse that rank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is your ruling Lord Kaizen?&#34; He asked with a creak of his chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m thinking about 3 grand a month.&#34; There has to be some punishment for this. She isn&#39;t going to raise this pup not only alone, but with no aid either. &#34;The pup is a dual citizen of Misfit and GreenMoon. They will have your surname, and hold inheritance to all your goods over any children you have in the future.&#34; I looked him up. He had other children, but they didn&#39;t live in his pack. interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three Grand?!&#34; He growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Five until after she gets off maternity leave.&#34; I said firmly. &#34;You will also be required to visit weekends and holidays, that the pup know their father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She will return to her old position here, but for now I want this to hurt. He did this, and what&#39;s worse was that she was the one suffering the most. No Council, be it the one held by Alphas or by the Royal houses, will hear a Rogue. His word is more like a King&#39;s word over a commoner&#39;s But she&#39;s wrong too she did this to herself on purpose for a position already taken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It appalls me how you thought I&#39;d side with you. This is why we have *mates*, so you don&#39;t go sniffing around.&#34; I hung up. I heard his mark mate shouting and I didn&#39;t feel like hearing her high pitched yipping Gods her accent was shrill &#34;Now with *you* I don&#39;t know what you expected.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He said he&#39;d take care of it. I guess this is what he meant.&#34; She growled. &#34;He said he was going to dump Ariza and marry me She hasn&#39;t given him a pup since she&#39;s sleeping with her true mate behind his back. But you know what? Fuck them both.&#34; She said with a snarl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t get so worked up about him.&#34; I said shaking my head. &#34;He took advantage of a young girl, and played with your feelings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were together BEFORE the party; I bet he&#39;s lying through his teeth back home to cover his own ass.&#34; She said as her eyes flashed orange with her wolf. &#34;But then it was just talking He&#39;d grab my ass during training. That kind of thing. He&#39;s Alpha, of course I&#39;d accept his advances Even my wolf Flint agrees with that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about waiting?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m cursed for the next 185 years your highness, and before that I waited for over a decade. I&#39;m sure you know, but killing on the Harvest Moon is a crime the goddess punishes 100%. &#34; She said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know of the curse.&#34; It helps I&#39;m her grandson I&#39;m sure she was *pissed* at me too, but chose not to curse me. All shifters who kill on the Harvest Moon become cursed 200 years to wait for a mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got back to his side of the story. He is already married and has been for years, but this was a lapse in his judgment. She was a young she wolf in her 50&#39;s asking her Alpha for &#39;just a dance&#39;. They had a brief, single night affair. It was after she became with pup that he changed her schedule and gave her a hard time in general. She left with her car and about 10 grand of his money, and 10 grand in watches, though he pardoned the theft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is the darker side of werewolves Each pack is sovereign, and the problem was that this was Disrespectful, but not illegal Even if it was, he&#39;d be the one reporting it to the council.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had rules and regulations of course, but Alphas hold nearly all the power unless they are defeated. The position is gained and maintained by being the strongestnot necessarily the most capable.  There isn&#39;t much this woman can do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had the father been anyone else, she&#39;d have gone to Alpha Green for him to intervene. He&#39;s the judge and jury. In our world, he&#39;s the last stop for justice in his pack And so long as it doesn&#39;t really affect the pack as a whole, my brother won&#39;t ever hear of this.</p>
