                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew I was dreaming. But I could only watch. Kaizen barked orders while using his powers to fly It was the End Mighty demons were underneath and behind him His father stood with his brothers in armor made by the Horned One himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All three of them rode giant dragon headed serpents even Asanguis. Even though he was a serpent himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forward!&#34; Kaizen barked, in I think demon. He was his true form, ten times the size I remembered him to be</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brother was shifted in a human form, in the sky with a white chariot, flying next to his brother, while Grace rode her mate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other side was a great army of white Angels of all regiments. All the saints and Champions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Surrender now!&#34; Shouted Rodrick He rode Uriel, holding a special incense holder It was a ball on a long chain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your people killed my fucking mate and child. Uriel, Rodrik I know it was not you two, but you stand in my way.&#34; Said Kaizen in perfect English.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will protect my people.&#34; Said Rodrick. &#34;I have issue with this I truly do, but I cannot allow you to march Zuviel&#39;s army across the earth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I willingly lend my multitudes.&#34; Said Xaxas coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am here for my grandson and daughter. I&#39;m skinning you lot for my office floor&#34; Growled Bryson. He stood on his serpents head, holding a hammer in his left hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your people betrayed the treaty. Your people will taste the death they wished for.&#34; Asanguis sneered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I find it a little droll that your people kill my pup, and slay my wife, then think nothing would happen. Forward.&#34; Kaizen Commanded, and I watched him breathe lightning and fire. The beam of it made deep trenches in the dirt. But I had no idea where they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demons poured from a large crack in the earth like water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Earth Goddess I think became a dead tree. I saw the Moon Goddess be killed in retaliation. By Hurculian.  I knew he was ordered to do that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you&#39;ve seen enough.&#34; Said the Horned One.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up, looking at my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was around 2pm I messed up my sleep schedule, that was for sure but everyone seemed relaxed. I could hear indistinct, but casual chatter all around the packhouse.. It seemed the worst was over, and that there was some kind of real peace. The birds sang, and I could hear Kaizen and Uriel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a shower, brushed my teeth, and put on Kaizen&#39;s hoodie The scent of it was nice He smelled like he was wearing expensive cologne. I knew that was just his natural smell but I&#39;d be lying if I said I didn&#39;t need that right now. I was so bothered this afternoon I don&#39;t know why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was that dream? I didn&#39;t remember it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it was That bad, maybe it was better that way?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My foal&#39;s gone home, so I guess I&#39;ll follow.&#34; Said Uriel in our office. &#34;I intend on seeing what my daughter did with the castle anyway.&#34; He said likely standing. I could hear the recliner move. We decided to keep it. It was really comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A shame too. I know Willow wanted to say goodbye to everyone, but they&#39;re Kings. They&#39;re missed too much.&#34; Chuckled Kaizen. He sounded like he knew I was up. &#34;I do!&#34; he yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That isn&#39;t fair!&#34; I shouted back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aye, but it&#39;s passive. Kings and Old Ones, those who carry ancient blood are stuck this way.&#34; Said Uriel in Kaizen&#39;s defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That and work. I&#39;m not even a King and my desk is still overloaded.&#34; Said Kaizen with a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve only been alive less than 48 hours, and I&#39;m already getting summons from the Holy Seat. He disagrees with the idea of Sanctuary, but I&#39;d rather not see anyone get hurt, and cause the War I literally already Died for to restart.&#34; He complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Afternoon Willow I know you didn&#39;t sleep too well.&#34; Said Kaizen, zipping to me before I could walk through the door proper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t remember anything about it.&#34; I admitted. Uriel hummed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A shame I didn&#39;t get to meet you properly. As I see, you know I am Uriel, the Glittering One.&#34; He bowed. &#34;You were used as a warning I heard your dreams.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did too.&#34; Said Kaizen. I hated that they heard, but I guess I was a microphone to be a final warning. To Both sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uriel took both our hands, and shook his head. &#34;Let it be known now that I mean my blood oath. To harm any of this bloodline, would break my vows.. And as you saw no good would come of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said this and left, but I was pulled into Kaizen&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know everything has been stressful on your part too but know that you&#39;re safe. I would not let you be hurt But don&#39;t leave me or Eternya&#39;s side He&#39;s currently downstairs, speaking with Ellio.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t mind having breakfast.&#34; I said as my stomach growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can make you some meat.&#34; He offered. That was sweet but I needed more than Just &#39;meat&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I&#39;ll make some veggies to go with it.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We held hands, and I saw a beam of light, that had to be The Unicorn King leaving. But Eternya paid no mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandfather I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll meet anyone&#39;s standards.&#34; Said Ellio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me either.&#34; Said Rubin, the blonde minotaur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already know that. I mean to teach you all self-defense.&#34; He said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father We both know that if they become targets, with your name attached to them and Lord Kaizen&#39;s mark, they won&#39;t stand a chance.&#34; Flora was washing dishes, but I could feel the tension in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better they know Something than Nothing.&#34; Eternya said with a shake of his head. &#34;Kaizen back me up here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s right. They won&#39;t participate in any real battle, but You Might. They at some point could be away from you. I know you love them, even Alavastros, but if you coddle them, they will be fodder.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. I&#39;ll only allow it because that does make sense.&#34; She said looking down &#34;But don&#39;t hurt them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have the steady hands of a surgeon.&#34; Said Eternya.  He summoned a scimitar it disappeared with a puff of hot air. &#34;Actually I think I&#39;ll train all the chicks here. It wouldn&#39;t be a *bad* thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would that include me?&#34; Asked Jack. He materialized from the wall I also think he does that to show off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want? You&#39;re adept at shadow magic. Incredibly rare for a shifter.&#34; Eternya thinking out loud. &#34;A new son of the master will be here Whatever I can do to keep my bloodline safe, benefits me as well.&#34; He said leaving out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack followed, and Kaizen got me to sit on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Kaizen-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She happily ate, and I went upstairs to make a phone call. Dad answered about the 4th ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re stressed.&#34; He said before I could say anything. &#34;Pups are a blessing, and you&#39;ll be a fine father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what if I&#39;m not?&#34; I asked. &#34;What if my new title gets in the way of me being there. Even now I feel pulled to leave Urth to train, so I may be stronger so I can protect her from the Light&#39;s minions.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uriel was a unicorn He would keep his word. To ruin it, to betray it would make him a bicorn...a demon horse He&#39;d grow goat horns, and loose his fur, grow scales, and bat wings He&#39;d be in the possession of grandfather then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that could not be said for Herculian</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw her premonition Be it just a warning or not, it wasn&#39;t impossible. The Demigod of Strength was only as passive as his father let him be.  There&#39;s a sun brand on his right shoulder, as grandfather&#39;s brand is on my left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold off on leaving.&#34; Said father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-&#34; Mother cut me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s too much unrest Kaizen.&#34; Said mother. &#34;Tyson is an official general of hell... Contention for his right to the throne is active. If push comes to shove, dad could rule, but just hold off&#34; She said silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright mom.&#34; I said relenting. I should have taken this call outside. I felt congested in my office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew the Council&#39;s bickering and complaining would blow over soon, as there were no real threats from any Seats with Brutus dead and Jang wallowing in insanity but they had a point. The Point of the King&#39;s Position was the protection of this world FROM grandfather, not be part of it.. Defined lines in the proverbial sand were always touchy when it came to the Horned One, and affiliation with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I relented, not liking the hesitation, but it was for a good reason. I went back downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; She asked. Willow&#39;s stress could be scented over her normal woody one That isn&#39;t good for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m alright; just annoyed that I&#39;m stuck with work.&#34; I half lied, not that she could tell lies from truths anyway Well not with powers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you need to talk to me, you can.&#34; She said getting up, putting her dish away. I offered to wash it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She worries about not only me, but now our son. One who will grow to be as strong as I am now One that I have to raise right, being born Number Fucking 4. He&#39;ll be able to teleport to hell as soon as he figures it out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell, no matter what it looks like, is still no place for the young. It ages you it seeps into your bones and tests your sanity and your mettle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I worry that if I slip up, my son will be spoiled. He&#39;s going to be born a prince a general maybe even assist in a Layer of Tarteron What can I do to prevent that? Will living as Just an Alpha be enough? I looked again at my mate, who caught onto my state of mind</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods her hug felt nice. It reminded me of what I was fighting for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also Willow scented like she was starting to heat again? That wasn&#39;t right.?</p>
