                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed them down the hall and to the cars. We all got in a black Nissan, honestly not what I was expecting with how Kaizen drives. There was a small emotional pain that came from thinking about him He was sentenced at midnight so I wouldn&#39;t see him again until what felt like eternity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lord that was unnecessarily dramatic</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The best thing for being mate-sick is getting out, and not letting your emotions get to you.&#34; Said Isabelle, who put her hand on me gently. I agreed to spend time with them and to open up</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They encouraged me to smile, and when we got to the parking lot, a valet had a key that Kaizen&#39;s mother took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was thinking we go into town and have breakfast at Royal Café, My treat.&#34; Said Harmony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we could show her the pack here.&#34; Beamed Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would like that.&#34; I said with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as I hated how this played out, I couldn&#39;t hate them but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever forget either. The bitterness I felt lingered like the aftertaste of lemon pith Its rind held sour fruit, one that tasted like what a broken connection feels like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever ideas you have are Welcome.&#34; I mumbled. &#34;It&#39;s like a raw wound.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. And I know you probably feel powerless about this&#34; Said Nixxia. &#34;Before my mate, I was a blood slave to the Vampires. I was bred to be drained. And then you saw Lord Xaxas exhibit his true presence up close without warning.&#34; She glared at the castle, as if she was also mad at the King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He had to do that.&#34; I admitted. &#34;I could tell those two wouldn&#39;t have just stopped.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was general agreement, and we headed into town. The modern homes reminded me of a rich suburb, however there were a few old buildings scattered here and there. They reminded me of the elvish buildings in their village and I was reminded of another fond memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Omegas live in town, and commute to the castle. They work with us, because those with elder&#39;s blood can be too much for a regular wolf.&#34; Said Isabelle, seeing my curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I kind of heard a Little about that.&#34; I&#39;d also seen it too with Kaizen &#34;What about your titles? Are all of you Risen? What does that mean?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The short of it is that it makes us unable to die.&#34; Said Harmony. Nixxia, Izzy, and I share this title, since we are married to the three Princes of Hell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But we didn&#39;t know that.&#34; Said Nixxia. &#34;Well I didn&#39;t at least I was a mortal blood slave before all this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before, I thought my mate was a normal werewolf.&#34; Said Isabelle. &#34;Then one day he kind of just came home with horns.&#34; She giggled. I did too. I knew there was likely more to it than that, but I enjoyed the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow Kaizen always said he&#39;d be a general.&#34; I mumbled I wondered should I bring it up but I&#39;d wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not wrong either. We were claimed by grandfather.&#34; Said Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was making small talk, avoiding my real question. I knew with titles like that, they all probably heard me. They were just polite about it. I knew through Kaizen, titles indicate that someone is able to do something Like Charred is his elemental fire bite, and the other council members also do some elemental thing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he told me to be wary of vague titled people. Most of them were Old Ones unkillable, ancient servants of Hell&#39;s Crown Prince, Xaxas. The Horned One allotted each son a fourth of hell to rule as they saw fit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That part I knew from the church stories. I never thought I&#39;d ever see anything like them, yet I sat next to their wives and daughter. Married to a son. I wondered who else was out there. They didn&#39;t butt in. It was nice. It made me feel respected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isabelle pulled into a space, we got out the car. The Café here looked homely, with a barn house aesthetic to it. It was shaped like a log cabin, yet, the light gray painted, hardwood furniture looked to be made of rustic finished walnuts and maples. People bowed immediately, though they gave royal nods to release them. I&#39;d seen Kaizen do that, since even though he was a fugitive, people still respected the crown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat down, and a pot of coffee, crème, and sugar was left for us to sip while we all decided pancakes would be best. It seemed the same wheat that was served at Wix&#39;s party was popular. It was served here as well, meaning that other older creatures must have used it as a substitute for normal wheat as well. They came with it nearly instantly too, making sure we had enough syrup, butter, and jam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think this was one of the few times that I Actually felt like a princess</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a question.&#34; I said cutting into mine. It smelled so good to taste like cardboard but I knew that was this damn connection To be loved by someone so fully would make a void like this when they&#39;re gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was wondering Nixxia How does it feel?&#34; I asked, referring to what she&#39;d said about herself... that once she was a blood slave. I saw the pens If she was raised down there or not it didn&#39;t matter That vampires had her was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was Weak human. I was subject to do whatever it was I was commanded. They gave me special privileges since my blood grade was so high, but I was still made to know my place. No one could put their hands on me but it wasn&#39;t a walk in the park either.&#34; She admitted. &#34;Now I&#39;m strong I&#39;m not just hiding behind my mate as a shield.&#34; She said proudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like to be turned?&#34; Asked Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Kaizen-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help!&#34; Screamed a false Willow, being mauled by a mechanical monstrosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked, smelled, and sounded like her. I lost control and she was taking the brunt of its punishment</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You lost control again.&#34; Said Slah-hesh&#39;Rrah impatiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For 365 days, I was beaten and boiled. My flesh was made to dehydrated jerky, and every breath held at least a little salt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was a year ago now I had finally gotten back into shape. I was stronger for it too. I lived through the eyes of my victims every day, experiencing the hurt and betrayal they felt. I was made to understand this at a fundamental level while in unbearable pain yet</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You do not lose consciousness here and nothing numbs their methods. Death does not come for the dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put up another.&#34; Said the Lord of Murder, snapping his fingers, and replaying the Harvest Moon Night I had to keep the automatons away from the soul, yet also combat the wooden wind-up robots from getting to her without losing control, and without giving a &#39;killing&#39; blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got to witness the repeated death of Willow as well It was my worst fear and biggest trigger It was why at the moment, I used every ounce of strength I had to fight the demonic energy powered clockwork automaton</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a mannequin of black wood, that twirled and danced while holding a blunt club. If I failed again, it would beat &#39;Willow&#39; to death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even know puppets existed in hell, yet this one made the sound of a music box, clicking and whirring toward the visage of my little helpless wife The actor of which was a soul, though the screams of pain when I failed sounded exactly like my mate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fucus.&#34; Said Slah-hesh&#39;Rrah. &#34;Use your head, young master.&#34; He said looking silently at the false sky. This Layer of Tarteron wasn&#39;t on the surface, yet the black sun gave the dark crimson sky light enough that you knew it was day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mate died again. But this time there was a slow clap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Such a painful punishment. Your flesh looks tired.&#34; Grandfather said casually. In his domain, one could feel the words he spoke It reverberated on your bones, a sensation I could not begin to describe as anything other than deplorable</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish to continue.&#34; I protested, ignoring my desire to quit from his command I need this control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will improve in time. I will allow this penance to persist despite how much I disagree with the method I see results.&#34; He said looking briefly at Slah-hesh-Rrah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you master.&#34; He bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look boy.&#34; He pointed; the living wood twirled like a ballerina before knocking the head off Willow one last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as I knew it wasn&#39;t real as I was All I could do was look and lament. I did not lose control, but I wanted to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come have lunch with me. Your grandmother made pie, and I won&#39;t be the only one who has to ingest her confection&#34; He said with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it That bad?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cringed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have been offered many things as sacrifice from worms to rotted bodies piled high but nothing pales in comparison to the burnt, raw abominations of Lulliba&#39;s handyworkAnd WE are going to eat every bite, and give her warm smiles as if we&#39;re eating chocolate cake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been beaten and roasted battered and beaten. But I don&#39;t think I wanted to run away With his teleport, we were at his grand, black stone palace And I could smell her monstrosity from here The undeniable scent of raw dough and burned bread</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If she asks you will tell her you want seconds.&#34; He commanded, steeling himself. &#34;My dear, I brought one of our grandchildren.&#34; He smiled wide. They hugged, and then she turned to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the Moon Goddess, grandmother&#39;s true skin tone was the color of moondust, while her hair was silvery white in her happiness she literally glowed, and I could see why grandfather threatened me so badly her clothes were even burned.. holy shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hugged me, smelling of campfire. &#34;I love you so much! I made apple pie!</p>
