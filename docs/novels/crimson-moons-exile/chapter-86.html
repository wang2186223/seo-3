                <p>chapter where I would go in depth on the Layers of Sex and Sloth, but I won&#39;t publish it unless y&#39;all want to see. I was inspired by stuff like Donte&#39;s Inferno since before the Beginning of this series. but this was more fun.  Anyway, enjoy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew by the mate bond that he&#39;d never cheat that wasn&#39;t it. I just didn&#39;t like that he thought to hide things. I was a little over it, but at the same time a little bit not &#34;I want to be included. It doesn&#39;t matter; stress is natural.&#34; I said truthfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We shared a tender kiss that made my shoulders relax The tenseness I had was melted away, and I accepted his attempts at apologizing. I knew I wasn&#39;t overreacting, nor did he deny my feelings He loved me fully, and when I pulled away, Kaizen pressed his forehead to mine. I was told only the closest of wolves did this He was showing that he loved me his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t want you to worry All you&#39;ve done is hold fear in your heart from everything. I didn&#39;t want to add to it.&#34; He said quietly. &#34;You have every right to be angry with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not, but just.&#34; I huffed. I didn&#39;t want to ruin our time; he&#39;d already done all this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have to do anything.&#34; He said huskily. &#34;If you want to go back downstairs-&#34;  I cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was more horny now than anything. The desire grew as he held me like this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know we don&#39;t, but I need this.&#34; I hugged his chest, and reached down. I trailed down his abs slowly to the rim of his boxers I hesitated but I reached in. I held it in my hands... I felt it pulse and grow before I even began to pump it Kaizen felt like a toilet paper tube I didn&#39;t need a toy; I was standing in front of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hissed in pleasure Damn he was so big How has he ever fit inside me?  I slowly pumped it, enough to make him slowly rock his hips to the motion. He got hard in my hand, having his eyes closed as the tingles danced on firmly clasped fingers. Those electric tingles, traveled down my hand to my core</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moaned quietly, as silently as I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow.&#34; He warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t matter, because I didn&#39;t care</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know I was following my feelings</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were both stressed and aroused I slowly kneeled down... I unbuckled the belt to his jeans and slid down his boxers. He was hard as a brick  I also tied my hair into a ponytail with a stray lock of hair</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This.&#34; I put it in my mouth and licked the tip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; He said flexing his claws. &#34;What Are You Doing?&#34; He asked again, panicking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What *I* want.&#34; I said with a growl. &#34;Close the door...&#34; I demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.. Yes Ma&#39;am.&#34; He said closing the door by zapping it with his powers, and I could hear the chuckles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me blush, but I started this, well my body did but damn it all I was getting wet. I could only fit a little of it in my mouth, but I licked his head before sucking it. He snarled like I&#39;d never heard before I could feel the pulse of it in my mouth each swirl, since I was making it up as I went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willow.&#34; He grunted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I licked harder. I sucked his cock, and bobbed my head so I could put more of him in my mouth. I could now fit only half of such a wide, lengthy member, and he moaned loudly. I looked up to see his head was thrown back, and he put his left hand on top of my hair to adjust my speed. He grabbed my ponytail and gently tugged that made me wet too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was going too fast. He wanted to savor this and take his time, while I was getting wet with the idea of this enormous monster in me I wanted this more than when I was in the full throw of heat I put his balls in my hand and massaged them while I sucked it hard, and he reached to grip anything other than me. He broke the end table, and promptly got me to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He throbbed as his testicles contracted in pleasure, but he didn&#39;t cum. He was just enjoying himself like I wanted I wanted him to beg for it. I wanted him to fuck me like he did when I was in heat I wanted to be ravaged like he was a hungry, wild animal and I was a rabbit</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;What happened to my little mate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put me on the bed, and pulled off my pants. He kneeled, being so tall that even stooped, he could reach without an issue. He licked me from my entrance to my button, and swirled his tongue around when he got to the top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sucked my button, and I screamed. &#34;Kaizen!&#34; I shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want the beast, you&#39;ll have it.&#34; He snickered, holding a sinister smile that showed he was up to no good himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mate only chuckled, knowing that every touch was amplified 10-fold by the bond. Each touch, we both moaned, feeling the intense pleasure and want being given and taken through our connection</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you Kaizen. I want you right now.&#34; I moaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you wanted me to *beg* for it.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled. &#34;You&#39;re not playing fair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why should I?&#34; He grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word I was grabbed by the leg. As he stood, I was pulled swiftly to him, and he grabbed his fully erect member, and massaged around my entrance with the head of it. He ran it from my button to my entrance and slowly entered me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held my hips, hesitating a moment. He was so large, sometimes I forgot he had to wait &#34;I&#39;m going slow and steady.&#34; He said flexing his claws. It wasn&#39;t much, just enough to let me know he was Alpha, and his say was final. But not if I could help it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was slow, but forceful with his thrusts. Each one hit the wall of my core, while he grunted in pleasure, half growling. It felt so good The feel of it in me filling me to the brim, having it almost exit I had my eyes squeezed shut, humming each impact, feeling like I was being ridden it felt so good. I needed more. He slipped in and out of me since I was so wanting</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harder.&#34; I said with a yearning whine. I didn&#39;t hold back either. I was depraved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should be gentle.&#34; He countered, but he did go a little harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t hurt me.&#34; I said with a real growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You feel so fucking good&#34; He said going harder like I&#39;d asked. He slammed into me, putting my legs up on his shoulders like I wanted. He didn&#39;t pick me up this time, but he made up for it by ramming me with the force of a bull in rutt...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; I yelled, gripping the sheets with all the force I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bed rocked with his force, sliding across the room until it was wedged between the broken night stand and the wall... It hit the wardrobe, and the banging was probably heard downstairs</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hit my button with every slap, and I began to climb the mountain again. He was so wild and ravenous, yet at the same time I knew he was showing restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harder. Harder please.&#34; I moaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked me up by the hips and I could feel the contractions of my entrance. He drilled me so hard, that I came with an explosion. I screamed in pleasure, and it was what he needed to become erratic before he pulsed as well. He came into me with a snarl, pumping me full, and when he pulled out, two or three pumps still exited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to stop or we&#39;re going to have an actual litter.&#34; He panted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we do, we have more than enough toys, clothes, and bottles for a while.&#34; I said being helped up. He had to carry me to the shower, but he had no issue with it. He kissed me roughly the whole walk, and when he turned on the shower, he put me down so we could share a kiss in the steam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grumbled growls knocked the shampoo over, but neither of us cared. &#34;I don&#39;t know why, but I want to mark you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you did right now, we&#39;re fucking.&#34; I warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hummed as he didn&#39;t hesitate to mark me he was still hard. He obviously didn&#39;t mind, and I didn&#39;t either To be fair, this was kind of our first sort of fight but this wasn&#39;t &#39;sort of&#39; sex.</p>
