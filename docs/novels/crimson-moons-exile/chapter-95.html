                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nap was accompanied by a song and gentle pats on my head. I think it was Isabelle, so I didn&#39;t say anything</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The snow may be cold,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind may blow down,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Do not fear the darkness, for I will come soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the Sun Rises from East to West</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I love you, and I will protect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For even in the darkest nights, I am here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, pray to the Lady, and she will come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For tis her duty to her children.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hummed the melody now. It sounded almost familiar. I know I&#39;d never heard it before, but at the same time, the almost melancholy tune held a bit of hope. Out of curiosity, I lifted my head, and I was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pups were in the arms of their grandmother when I woke up. Isabelle&#39;s hum was clear as a and soft. I didn&#39;t know she could sing. But then again I never asked. It was soft and simple. I liked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to wake you.&#34; She smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No worries What was that?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Song of the Pale Lady.&#34; She smiled. &#34;It&#39;s said that in times of great joy or sorrow, she hears us, and gives us strength. I learned it from, of all people, my uncle Connor gods that clown.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know wherever she is, she&#39;s dying to get her hands on the boys.&#34; I said warmly. &#34;And I don&#39;t really know Connor but all your people are good ones. I can see why the goddess chose you guys to marry her sons.&#34; I said seeing her nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think that was why I didn&#39;t mind them around my pups, even though they were just born. I had issue with even Eternya a moment, but I also chalked that up to hormones. He&#39;d just got in a fight with Herculian. I heard most of their argument and weak as I was, if I could, I would have tried to fight the demigods for my sons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m grateful she gave me a good daughter too.&#34; She said kissing me on the top of the head. For their people, they only did that with very close relatives, or their children. I guess I was her pup as much as Kaizen  &#34;She is free, but I wish she were here too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They stay away so we can be independent.&#34; I said honestly. Having them in our lives even more than they already are would be fun, but we would probably never grow as people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why learn anything when someone can just fix it with magic? The town didn&#39;t smell like fire anymore, so I know someone probably reset the town I was fine with that. There was no real lesson all those displaced people would learn other than it was too risky to live with Kaizen as Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe some of them already felt that way. I don&#39;t think I could imagine being a regular human anymore, and something this otherworldly not only happen, but KEEP happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And someone like the Realm King, The Literal Horned One, or Death here on a whim at any time. Or the guy known for making pelts out of people who piss him off, Kaizen&#39;s father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, where&#39;s Kaizen?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With his father. They went hunting for you.&#34; She said passing me my pups. They were hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t have to do that.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He does. No matter how much training he has for his instincts, he is driven to provide. That&#39;s a core, fundamental part of us.&#34; She said like it was a warning. &#34;If provoked, he Will be the monster he needs to be to protect you three.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They angrily squeaked. Lunch was late, and they let the world know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t learned how to use my pump yet. But Isabelle showed me how. It was nice having her around to do this She gently held my hand You could tell she was a mother through and through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt like I forgot someone  it bothered me a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t like the fake teat, but once they realized it had milk, they chowed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One tip I will say now is that you should have a strict, and I mean STRICT schedule. Every Four hours the first few months, and then one day, they&#39;ll just be more active. About when their eyes open. Then they&#39;ll get into Everything.&#34; She giggled. &#34;They will get used to the routine quickly, since they will age like human children.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; I said helping them burp, then go to the restroom like she showed me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Most supernaturals do.&#34; She said as if she were thinking about it. &#34;Human childhoods are the default, but age stops between 18 and 35, sometimes 40 if stress is involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that why Xaxas looks so young?&#34; I asked. He and Harmony looked like a young couple like me and Kaizen, but I heard his age was laughable. Nobody would tell me How old though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s a special case. So honestly, he can look however he wants.&#34; She said shaking her head. &#34;He&#39;s literally Uncle Connor, but with powers. Be careful you don&#39;t make any deals with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know my mythology but thanks for the warning.&#34; I smiled. Her kindness made me wish my mom could be here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should know how happy I am She should be able to see her grandchildren, but I stay away for her sake I know that nothing good would happen knowing that they would stop at nothing to find me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And here I was almost forgetting about them</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They would want me to come home, and likely pretend that nothing happened They would cry tears of joy at first, then be bitter that I was marked by the Hornd One. Even in death, I would never see them again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s what made me shed a tear</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They wouldn&#39;t understand either My pups weren&#39;t born with a mortal form I don&#39;t even think like a human anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awe. I know that look. You&#39;re thinking about your mother, aren&#39;t you?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s a bit disheartening but they&#39;re still likely making their peace with your &#39;death&#39;. It wouldn&#39;t be right to get their hopes up.&#34; She said this to warn me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know better than to ruin their ignorance of this world Mom wouldn&#39;t handle this well, especially dad. He&#39;s a decan at our church their church.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then all the better you remain in their hearts, and them in yours.&#34; She said holding me like a baby. &#34;That it. You can cry it out with me. I don&#39;t fully understand, but I get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>----Kaizen-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Boy I&#39;m warning you!] barked dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rammed him again. But now instead of hunting I was running for my life. It was fun, but when he caught me, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I got at Least nipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was being cheeky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[When I get my paws on you, I&#39;m making you a rug!] he roared. It rang through the forest as I laughed just as loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mindless minotaur attracted to my herd were carefully taken home by Flora and her father. That was the task I gave them, while I sent Ace with the meat I already got. A rabbit wasn&#39;t enough! I know though that of all the meats, it would be her favorite though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Foxes love rabbit. Wolves do too. For them to be so cute, they are delicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught me, and now we rammed each other like butting rams. We used to do this when I was young. He used to train us how to fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Eat my dust old man!] I yipped, cheating, dashing away with lightning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rained down from the sky as a beam of red light. When motivated, he was a force to be reckoned with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Now what was that?] He asked with a raised brow. Even as a wolf, father was probably twice my size, Tyson too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was only king because dad Didn&#39;t want the crown, and more importantly, he was way overqualified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[I said Eat Shit Rock Sniffer!] I laughed. I got him with a little zap on the nose. It didn&#39;t hurt him, I don&#39;t think it was possible</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost felt like a pup again. My mate was fed, my family was protected And I got to see my father half pissed, half enjoying himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[You Little Shit!] He ran after me, while I stole a nip at his heels by whipping around with my lightning. This surprised him too. He Thought I was going to submit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Time out!] I yelled, running into a deer literally on accident. I crashed into the poor thing, and now we chased it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the amount of meat I was hoping to hunt. That would stuff my mate We let it run, for honor&#39;s sake, and after we caught it, we shared the kill together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dad shifted, and when I did, I slung my half over my shoulder. &#34;Let&#39;s head back. I sense Willow is upset.&#34; I said looking in the direction of the clinic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She misses her family.&#34; Said dad. &#34;That&#39;s not something we can outright fix, or get involved with. But go to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t rightly think he&#39;d ever peered into the heart of another for anyone, not on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will.&#34; I said leaving as a bolt of lightning. No matter how minor or great, her sorrow was mine to share. She gave me sons; the least I could give was a little comfort and fresh food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Food always made things a little better.</p>
