                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were clacks of heels coming rapidly down the stairs, though I&#39;d already done what I was going to do. I could tell it was Flora, but why she already sounded ready for confrontation was beyond me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing down here?!&#34; She demanded. She ran past me to the sleeping ginger bull, and patted him between the horns. &#34;You turned him I can smell the Horned One&#39;s touch&#34;. He hummed happily, knowing his mother&#39;s scent. She looked at him like mother looks at me, as she loved her child. Whatever happened to get them here, she made sure he was taken care of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d seen her upset; it seemed being the grumpy, nosy neighbor was the norm, but this time it seemed as if there were genuine concern in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made them part of my war band. They would have remained like caged cattle otherwise.&#34; I said simply. &#34;Elder Asmondi asked this of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew he would the day you stepped out the door of your car I knew&#34; She mumbled. &#34;But This wasn&#39;t your place! I was working on a cure, and maybe I mightI might have fixed it.&#34; She looked down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long have you worked on a cure?&#34; I asked. There wasn&#39;t one This is a condition etched into their being. That some are this way without reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We figured out yellow lavender aids in their attitudes, but I hadn&#39;t figured out a way to fix the next part.&#34; She mumbled, not answering my question. I could pry and read her mind if I wanted, but I&#39;d rather not give her a headache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That wasn&#39;t what I asked.&#34; I said firmly. If blue lavender was rare, yellow lavender was damn near impossible to get unless you were cultivating it Not many even knew it existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pet her son, debating on if she should say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Since the treaty&#34; So since 1605. Fuck. &#34;He recognizes me and his father, but he doesn&#39;t like others. I feed them, brush them. Give them fresh meat and clean hay. It&#39;s the least I can do; this is our fault.&#34; She mumbled. &#34;The other parents come occasionally but they don&#39;t have the heart to see their children like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are the other mothers?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ark and Wik&#39;s mother died in childbirth. I never met her, but their father brought them here. Ark&#39;s the black one, and Wik&#39;s the brown one. Rezzol comes to visit them. He&#39;s the black bull with white patched hair. I think you&#39;ve met him maybe in passing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have. Everyone in town is registered as pack now.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True. The blonde one, Rubin is an orphan. He&#39;s probably the youngest, being 352 or 3 I think. I tend to them all. His father died 90 years ago, but he left him 5 million dollars in his will. Tamriel manages it with me, but to be fair he&#39;s only around down here to make sure they&#39;re treated right. He also blessed my lawn so I can cultivate the yellow lavender. It only grows in holy places.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that why you make such a fuss about your garden?&#34; I said seeing her nod. &#34;Your efforts are noble, and I see they&#39;re well cared for, but there is no cure for what ails them, Flora. Your son is safe with me.&#34; I said putting a hand on her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like.&#34; She growled, holding the massive head of her son. &#34;He&#39;s why I live here in willing exile The shame of birthing a son with such a condition, being the only descendant of the Great Fire BirdBeing expected to take the mantle of being Queen of my people, and raze rebellion against the Dragon King of the Sky to free them. but instead, having a child with a man other men see as a beast. I moved here for my little Elio. My people tried to burn him while I was out hunting back then, but thankfully he&#39;s magic and fire resistant. It&#39;s been like this for years. Now I come down here; the smell of iron reaches the front door of this place. What was I to think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You scent only my blood.&#34; I said firmly, hiding my surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, she was also wrong Eternya the Flaming One, Great Fire Bird had another bastard, though she was banished to another world altogether. Should my uncle find out about Flora, Xaxas might kill her on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw what you did to the mindless ones in the forest, the ones who were attracted to the smell of their fellow kin I know some were pillaging the countryside, so it was needed, but when I heard you were down here, I got scared.&#34; She said kissing her son, who shifted in her hands, though the others hadn&#39;t yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I silently watched, letting her say her piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was asleep, looking like his father. She cried, cradling him. &#34;If you were born in skin, things would have been different. If I&#39;d have taken my throne, you&#39;d have been a prince. Not just a &#39;stinky animal&#39; as my people called you, in a dungeon because of my incompetence&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Eternya knew he had unaccounted blood As a general of my uncle, he&#39;d have likely killed you.&#34; I said truthfully. &#34;Better that while they slept, you weren&#39;t known and slipped into obscurity. I will keep the secret of your bloodline.&#34; I said kneeling to her eye level. &#34;How brave you are to endure so much. You traded your position and your people for him, and in turn he loves you all the same.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She balled heavy tears on her son, the grandson of Eternya&#39;Rocktelaam. The grandson of the Great Fire Bird, a demigod, son of the Volcano god. During the war he burned the ground so hot, that some areas to this day will not grow grass It is said on hot days, you can still hear the screams of the spirits, and crackle of his flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was almost like I was amassing an army not of my own doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did I not know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did I not notice her scent? She smelled... like bird, nothing special.... only the smallest bit like Eternya....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that I looked, she held his resemblance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I linked my Warriors to help me take them home. &#34;I&#39;m taking them to the packhouse.&#34; I said gently. I could not understand what she was going through, being so high born, loving a commoner, and birthing a bastard who ate cud. &#34;We&#39;re low on space, but I will arrange beds for them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I have plenty. All 4 of them are my sons as far as I&#39;m concerned. I know it&#39;ll be fine.&#34; She said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. It may be better that they have their own rooms and space for a time.&#34; I said agreeing with her. The rest shifted as well, finally getting human forms. Their belly buttons held grandfather&#39;s symbol, and they were all pale as paper, being down here and in fur their entire lives</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t long before the warriors came, and we picked them up, well, except Flora&#39;s son Elio. She held him herself, and upstairs the other living parents were waiting alongside Tamrieland his friend. She clothed her son herself, while we got the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had the formally black minotaur, Ark. They slept as if nothing was going on around them, having their bodies adjust as they rested to the new condition they held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tamriel was waiting It seemed he had another one with him, one that didn&#39;t look like his photocopy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This one had blazing gold eyes and hair to match. He looked as if they were made of actual metallic gold, rather than flesh. Tamriel brought likely someone above himself He certainly looked it. His dark skin was radiant, as his entire body had a small golden glow meaning he was a full angel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took one look at Elio, stomped his foot, and became encased in glowing gold armor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You act as if I have malevolent intent Tamriel.&#34; I said calmly, but he sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not be so casual with me Boy.&#34; He spat, but the other angel put his hand on his shoulder He was my height after I grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother, we mean to interrogate, not demolish the land beneath our feet. I am Gettriel, Leader of the Eagle Wing Unit. I mean to speak with you, alone.&#34; He said calmly. His sneer matched his brother in arms, yet, his words were at least less provoking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no issue with that.&#34; I handed Ark&#39;s limp body to one of my Warriors. &#34;I&#39;ll be fine; take them all to Flora&#39;s if I don&#39;t return soon; they will recognize her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sir.&#34; Said Warrior Commander Patrick. I thought it best to have him, not Gilbert command the Warrior unit. He was Alpha of this place before I got here, so he knew the land and the people. But also, and more importantly: he had experience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come with me.&#34; Said Gettriel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed him with Tamriel, and Sentinel was in the back of the security station. I readied myself in case I needed to teleport. I already had a plan. Those I turned would be their targets. And my mate. She&#39;s too green to get away without my help</p>
