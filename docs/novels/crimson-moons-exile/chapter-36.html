                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept my eyes on the road while Willow finally went to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Alpha, we&#39;re right behind you./ Linked Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Good, we&#39;re only stopping for gas./ I linked back. /We&#39;ll go for 11 hours, sleep 8 in Ohiya, then go the rest tomorrow./</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Yes boss./ all three linked at the same time. It gave me a small headache, but thankfully those go away once everyone stops trying to talk to me all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d been driving 4 hours 24 more to go. The castle was deep in the interior of Grandia&#39;s eastern inland border I was spent. I was driving on a nap, but I would be fine. I would sleep when we got to the vampire den. They had an Earth B&amp;B in their Cleavelump Ohiya Den. Not Too far from Ace&#39;s people</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought about all this as I drove What a fucking mess. But I&#39;m glad Willow answered the phone. They would have eventually found us, and once they did, they would have then raided Misfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Likely at night</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Likely with Tyson and the hyenas; a normal pack would stand *no* chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And to be honest if they did that, I know I wouldn&#39;t have any control over myself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped to get gas in Madisun Wi, and Willow got up from the stop. I paid with my card and started pumping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow I was out a while.&#34; She commented with a stretch. She got out, walking to the driver&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We still have so much to go too.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost wondered where the time went. Jack switched with Ace, but they seemed to be having a good time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my turn.&#34; She said getting in the seat. I would have argued with her, but she was well rested. &#34;Please don&#39;t argue with me, I know that face.&#34; She said knowing me too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; I mumbled. She cranked the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked out the window as she drove, but sleep came almost naturally. I didn&#39;t dream or travel. I almost expected that I was going to, but to be honest I needed it. I was so comfortable, that for once I let my guard down in my sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a chance that regardless of compliance, that Tyson would cull the innocent I left at Misfit But then he would have to answer to Tamriel I couldn&#39;t see a world where his wife or son becoming homeless or offed would lead to anything good for the royal family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I no longer saw my brother as blood. He would threaten my mate with his nonsense. He would put her into this, when if things had been different, we might have been visiting for some pleasant reason or another</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at the same time, a certain relief came with knowing that soon this would be over one way or another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please stop.&#34; Rang the sweet voice of my grandmother, Lulliba,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My goddess I cannot.&#34; I mumbled, feeling her hands wrap around my neck. She hugged me, and I could almost feel her tears. &#34;Forgive me for your tears. Do not cry for me. I will either see you, or grandfather soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made it worse. She balled onto me, and the next thing I knew, I was teleported to the palace in Tarteron. Grandfather I could taste his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Release him my most lovely. He marches to battle. Let him be a man.&#34; He said glaring at me as if I&#39;d decided to come here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise you won&#39;t kill him.&#34; She asked nicely, quieting her genuine tears</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I cannot grandmother. He threatens my pack, and mate&#34; I said somberly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I still didn&#39;t see him as a brother right now, that didn&#39;t mean that he wasn&#39;t. We shared the same blood we looked, even sounded as mirror images.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then at least Promise if the chance comes for mercy, you&#39;ll at least consider it.&#34; She negotiated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can agree to that. I promise that if I do defeat him, that I won&#39;t kill him IF he surrenders. He needs to pardon me. And most trail by combat is to the death. I doubt he&#39;ll want to stop.&#34; I  mumbled this, because all in this room already knew that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry I accidently summoned you.&#34; She wiped her eyes &#34;I can&#39;t take it. Why do they have to fight? Can&#39;t they just forgive each other and be happy?&#34; She was so shiny being silver. Grandmother&#39;s skin tone is actually like a new coin. She glitters and sparkles. Her radiance attracts we night creatures like moths, but I saw that shine fade a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandmother I *am* happy.&#34; I said giving her a hug, and petting her back. &#34;I could never be more happy, than with the little mortal at my side. Thank you that you let me feel true love Thank you for giving me a reason to *want* to end this, and try to remain on this world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This Will Be Resolved my butterfly.&#34; Said grandfather standing. &#34;Begone boy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped awake, and I was in the hotel what the fuck...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Ace------</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Avenge me.&#34; Said Brutus. He was in the reflection of the mirror clear as day I tried my best to ignore it. I was brushing my teeth, fresh out the shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you not avenge me?&#34; Asked Brutus. I didn&#39;t know if it was real or not My grandfather was skinned alive. Skinned wolves don&#39;t pass on until the pelt is buried or burned</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last time I heard, he was turned into a fucking *jacket*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought made Brutus cringe. &#34;You know feel fur stitched up in that closet? The rest of me is a rug Phillip wipes his feet on, and your aunts are chained up like dogs He&#39;s from the old times, older than me You know that that likely means.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A council member wouldn&#39;t do that, exiled or not.&#34; I countered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My family was thoroughly hated If my aunts were turned to the pack&#39;s sex slaves, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. Well a little. For everyone to always reference Phillip the Frosted One so well all the time, I doubt he&#39;d allow that kind of poor treatment</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know I&#39;m right. Why don&#39;t you stop by his pack in West Verginon?&#34; Brutus pestered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Won&#39;t.&#34; I hissed. &#34;You got what you deserved, and if my aunts suffer they earned that too. They Killed his BABIES.&#34; I hissed. &#34;I&#39;m related to Actual crib smothering baby killers. What *pride* is there in that? How can I live, and attone for *your* sins? What the Fuck am I supposed to do if I do have kids? All who don&#39;t actively hate and shun them, will try to get revenge for their children, and unborn.  *THAT* is the legacy you left. That is what they remember. BEGONE&#34; I shouted, nearly breaking the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t if I did, it would make trouble for the boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you talking to?&#34; Asked Jack. He made me jump. I didn&#39;t even see him in the mirror, what the fuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A ghost.&#34; I said turning and leaving out the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yourself.&#34; Jack corrected.  &#34;This room is filled to the brim with my victims. I don&#39;t see Brutus.&#34; He said as if he knew who I hallucinated &#34;I see my assumption is right by your face There are so many that they litter the street outside quite a ways away. I&#39;m surprised you don&#39;t hear the requiem of my successes The Reaper&#39;s even out there collecting them all. Sleep Ace. I&#39;ll take first and last watch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s firm pat on my shoulder made me see the horrors of what he&#39;d done. I made a mental note to never cross Jack a *long* time ago. Gods their faces. Holy shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crawled in bed, but my mind spun. Gilbert snored next to me in his bed, since Jack and him were sharing. Of course, Jack was out on watch, so he had his mattress to himself until it was my turn, then Jack would sleep in mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods that wolf&#39;s scent is so strong it&#39;s like gasoline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that wasn&#39;t a spirit, then I was losing my mind. That was *rare* but not impossible My people were designed to live a long time. Feebleness only really happens due to trauma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw blue scales reflect off the glass of the open curtains The Great Serpent and thousands of little orbs floated around him..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit. There went any doubts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve lost itJack was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I guess maybe I did have a traumatic enough life that I am, or that my lineage holds a screw loose, and it was passed to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my hands on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t hear nor see any other spiritsuntil Just Now.. How can I do anything for the boss, who so generously allowed me to breathe like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was stressed I was a Rogue But if I wouldn&#39;t have left like I did, I&#39;d be on a wall or a rug as well. I&#39;d have been groomed to be the perfect sociopath Pack or not</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s why I rejected my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was then that Fang started acting up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/I will NEVER forgive you for that./ He hissed it was the only time we talked, was to fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/I had to. She was one of them Fang./ I told him firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/She could have come with us if you tried hard enough. I wouldn&#39;t have minded the pup she was pregnant with I would not have minded being loved if only for our titles that YOU threw away./ He linked. /We should be rich and full of meat, not here and seeing grandfather./</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That little shit left out that she was pregnant. I knew she had a boyfriend I scented that when I got there. We never had a shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/WE DID!/ He snarled, hearing me. /we did./</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/She wouldn&#39;t have stopped. You know how many half cousins we had You saw the family records of deceased pups./ I said dismissively. This was a blessing as shit as the situation was. Even if the boss loses, which he won&#39;t. We might get pardoned./</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/Do you hear yourself?/ Fang scoffed. /We are a full blooded Grisham. They will smother you in your sleep, or maybe give you to the arena to rip apart as the next event We should have been with our mate. I will Never forgive you for that and when/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/What?/ I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/When he comes for us When the King comes to collect, I will not help you. I do not want to live in a world where the only person meant for us does not even want us / he whined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wouldn&#39;t let me pet him but I came over and did anyway. He took this harder than me, because in my head, I always knew it would happen. I knew I don&#39;t know how, but I did.</p>
