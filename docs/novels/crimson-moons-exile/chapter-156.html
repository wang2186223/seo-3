                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three days passed I couldn&#39;t figure out how to go about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wish was harder than she realized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun wasn&#39;t up. It was only 4am, but we&#39;re nocturnal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to break some of those habits for the boys will aid them later. They have to go to school in a few years. Plus, the pack runs on mortal time. I&#39;d finished patrol, and rested in just some sweats, while she hummed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a sweet little melody that they sing in their Churches When I closed my eyes I could almost see the cathedral in Bison. It&#39;s so old and grand</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Human architecture is beautiful It almost makes me wonder I wonder how humans live on worlds where they aren&#39;t food</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen if I bring her parents here</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Ghoul population has Skyrocketed. This is one of the rare places they may live Wendigo, Skinwalkers, and lampreymen are in the lake with the skin lickers, a kind of racconlike creature that honestly only wants the skin the lamprey and hagfishmen do the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas even asked to dump his creepy ass moving statue here. It looks like just a pillar That&#39;s it. A tall rock if you will. If you break eye contact, it wears you. It puts humans on like a hoodie and walks around until it rots, or a priest breaks it *and that&#39;s temporary.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That damn thing belongs in Hell! I hate it. I hate it so much!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>so no humans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would be Wrong to force everyone else to accommodate them. This is supposed to be their sanctuary guaranteed mortal free, except the demi-realm that emits no scent, heartbeats, nor mortal indication that humans are there at All.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it must be saidShe gave a wish that I have No idea How to go about answering  They *already* made a ruling on this I have to be careful with Harmony with pup I might be able to but I don&#39;t know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know how to go about this. They belong to the Light Court</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mortal parents are the problem. I just can&#39;t show up, and take them Well, I *could*, but it&#39;d piss off Arviel. He isn&#39;t letting those souls go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her father is basically a priest. And her uncle Is proper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow petted my hair she sang it almost like the A&#39;deL song Easy With Us, since she can draw out her notes. The pups were half asleep on my chest, and I listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You make it easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You make it easy to love you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every day is a dream</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every night you&#39;re my every&#39;thing&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why&#39;d you stop?&#34; I asked, while the boys yawned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.I&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat up. &#34;You don&#39;t have to keep going.&#34; I smiled gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The next part is &#39;Under the Sun, I love you hun, but...&#34; She burst into tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awe.&#34; I said as the boys wanted to try and console her too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It good mama.&#34; Said Ari. They sweetly tried snuggling her. Our kids, despite the horns, are good hearted. He didn&#39;t quite know how to say &#39;it&#39;ll be alright&#39; but we both figured it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Want Grandpa.&#34; Said Vex He was too small to Really understand Why he wanted the Horned One</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But alsoThat&#39;s not a bad idea but if they ask, I&#39;m sure the Horned One will be pissed that I sent my boys to do a man&#39;s job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go to bed boys. Your papa can help mommie.&#34; I said as they more or less went to bed. It&#39;s hard to make them go now, since they&#39;re so excited but the room became a little cooler and more relaxing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oddly enough that felt like dad&#39;s magic. Good to know that he&#39;s trying out more stuff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what&#39;s papa&#39;s plan?&#34; She asked with a slight smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This.&#34; I said about to raise my voice slightly. Eternya was busy, so I put in a request for Kusare to come by. &#34;Rotted One, I summon you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m glad Willow didn&#39;t say anything, but that did kinda remind me of Pickamon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s not fucking Ponkachewy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Master?&#34; He asked politely. When he bows his segments click. Of all Xaxas&#39;s generals That is his true 1st general He didn&#39;t give Asanguis a rank during the war, making him his steed but Kusare. He&#39;s an *old* monster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One that makes even my skin crawl</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His human form is probably just as handsome, if not more than Eternya, and he holds probably about as much charm, being naturally quiet. Patient. He is naturally beautiful, having green hair and yellow eyes. His Japanese appearance reminds me of a famous actor or two, however, his beast form is beastly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He becomes a giant hybrid monster. A third is centipede, a third is wasp and a third is spider He can also burst into millions of himself, or be one big one. The more he divides, the smaller he gets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His favorite thing is crawling into ears and injecting his stinger pretty much directly into the brain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People forget that Xaxas was a fucking problem By Harmony, he is content Through Willow, so am I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know little of children. But I will protect this place.&#34; He said with a light chitter. Willow *hated it* but as one born the wolf, and someone who knew him personally, I knew it wasn&#39;t hostile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just wake flora. She&#39;s next door.&#34; I said shaking my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah yes, the mortal with the frying pan.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;I got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to  go Below for this I can go by myse-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen I wouldn&#39;t leave you alone to ask for *my* parents.&#34; She said this so firmly, that I could feel her powers activate. She doesn&#39;t know fully *how* to teleport with fox magic yet, so we didn&#39;t actually go anywhere, but I took her. Fuck fest be damned. This was way more important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Than we really do need to see Xaxas This is an affair for the Realm King.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;YouYou don&#39;t have to do anything.&#34; She said looking me in the eyes they were so pleading she only lied to herself. &#34;I can handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. With tears like that I Must.&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I won&#39;t have her upset like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.Gods there was so much sex all around that that was the only scent in the air.  But this was Layer 1. It mostly smells like Urth here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The center of his altar had a grand canopy bed. The black veil was closed, and I could see Harmony was asleep under heavy blankets, while Xaxas sat on his throne. He was naked, judging souls everyone was except us. We were the ones getting weird looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But right now is probably the *best* time to ask a favor the mood&#39;s high, and everyone&#39;s drunk off the fest and actual alcohol. There were venders at the fringes of the stone yelling about their wares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why weren&#39;t we ripping our clothes off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The air only affects willing participants.&#34; Said Xaxas. &#34;That and I know you come for something serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both bowed our heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I come on behalf of my mate.&#34; I said, being permitted to rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then she can tell me herself.&#34; He said resting his knuckles on his cheeks. A towel was summoned over his junk, for her sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaizen heard how much I miss my parents.&#34; She mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s natural.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.So. so is the desire to be with them. Master.&#34; She paused. She&#39;s a fox in his throne room, not a sassy mortal. She looked at her hands, intimidated by his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In here, we are not his niece and nephew. In here we are subjects.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on.&#34; He motioned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I miss them.&#34; She cried in her hands. &#34;I got a sister I&#39;ll never meet! My mom, dad, and uncle are JUST three people I I thought that goodbye was enough I thought I had enough. I feel so selfish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That sounds *pretty* mortal.&#34; He said with a light smile. This amused him, but such a good mood usually brings better rulings than him outright dismissing us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d already had their ruling</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compensation was already given in the form of them giving her mother another girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held her He was nice enough to allow me to give her a moment to mourn. I held her I held her close as tears rolled down my bare chest If I have to turn them. I would. It would piss Arviel RIGHT off to lose a priest, and a decan and the two mortal females, but I Would for her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what do you *want?*&#34; he asked. &#34;You, who are mated to the blood of my brother&#39;s blood. You hold rank and weight in this room. Wife of 1st General Kaizen. Speak your desire here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want my human family.&#34; She cried in my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then go to them.&#34; He said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It can&#39;t be that simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.If I fail. They will die.&#34; She said so quietly that it was hard to hear her over the festival. I wonder did he give her that clairvoyance or did she figure it out, because I hadn&#39;t. &#34;Humans can&#39;t know we&#39;re real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bingo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I go there and they say no you&#39;ll kill them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ll be deleted.&#34; He said as if he spoke of weather. &#34;If they disrespect the wife of General Kaizen, they disrespect Father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think-&#34; I was cut off</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xaxas teleported behind me, and put a clawed hand on my shoulder. As his true form, I am small it reminds me of my place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong? You don&#39;t trust your wife lil&#39; buddy?&#34; Asked Xaxas. He leaned into my ear after my mate vanished. &#34;Have a little faith.&#34;</p>
