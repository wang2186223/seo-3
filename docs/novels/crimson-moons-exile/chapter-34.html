                <p>Willow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, your majesty, for taking care of the mindless in the herd.&#34; Said a man with bull&#39;s horns. He was tall as my mate, with silver and brown hair. He stood there like a soldier, sporting an officer&#39;s uniform that read &#39;Secret Police&#39;. The very agency that keeps supernatural people hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s no problem. That place is my territory now. I won&#39;t allow anyone to endanger our people.&#34; He said getting up shaking wrists with the tall man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I forgot. I&#39;m Officer O&#39;Davi, Assistant Chief. You must be Willow.&#34; He said lowering his head slightly, before extending his hand. He shook my wrist too, but I could tell it was Much less firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go and enjoy the party.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course sir.&#34; He did a bow like I saw the wolves do at Misfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some minotaur bow weird because beheading is how you kill their people.&#34; Said Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were so many people who all wanted to talk to Kaizen, or see who I was It felt good, but overwhelming to be honest. To be bowed to and served like a princess was something I still wasn&#39;t used to, but I wouldn&#39;t let anyone see that if I could help it. As much as I hate to admit, it is his position that keeps us safe</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to be as polite as possible too especially since there were so many different *kinds* of people here. That wasn&#39;t something I ever thought about until meeting Kaizen. These people had all different cultures, different values, and ways of life. It was more like speaking to dignitaries from different countries if I had to describe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like the minotaur they shook wrists with Kaizen, but they didn&#39;t bow as low as other people because beheading was their greatest weakness or the goblins, who in custom, gave Kaizen silver coins to show their loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like to mingle?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you go ahead.&#34; He said pointing to a goblin woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had to be Wix&#39;s wife. She was adorned with a ring on every finger, and her manicured nails were painted to match her blue sparkling dress. She was shorter than me, holding features that were pretty exaggerated. Her elvish ears were large, so was her nose and hands and she wore a thick layer of green makeup. Her purple hair was in a high bun, with a crown hair-pinned on top of it. The diamonds were the size of a quarter, and the gold shined brightly enough to let you know it was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made no judgement about her though, it was just odd to see a real live goblin, troll or otherwise. I was still getting used to seeing centaur walking around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad you made it!&#34; She beamed. &#34;I&#39;m Frankie, and Don&#39;t let Wixie lie to you. The shindig was My idea.&#34; She chuckled, shaking my wrist like the other supernaturals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Willow, but I think everyone knows that.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They do.&#34; She said taking me to her and her husband&#39;s table, but he was over by Kaizen. He hadn&#39;t made it to our table yet, but he likely wanted to talk to him in private. &#34;Do you like supernatural life?&#34; She asked. We sat at her table, and a servant put down a tray of small cakes and poured us tea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do. I can&#39;t lie and say that I miss my old life that much.&#34; I said thinking about it honestly I think it was the mate bond that did it, but I really didn&#39;t miss anything It was kind of replaced or the void of missing them was filled with thoughts of Kaizen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it makes you feel better, before I became Standing Queen. I was a commoner too.&#34; She said with a smile. &#34;Not All supernatural people are rich either. He found me in the slums off the coast of Spain.&#34; She said as if she were reminiscent of a time long gone. &#34;That was after the war, back when it was hard to be trusted, and harder still getting into a royal house for protection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That sounds awfulI also want to thank you all for letting us into your estate and getting us a house. We would likely still be running if not for your generosity.&#34; I said seeing her smile wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have at least 3 other properties in Misfit. Don&#39;t worry about it.&#34; She grinned. &#34;And with the bounty increase, I know our timing couldn&#39;t be better.&#34; She grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Increase?&#34; I parroted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dead or alive too.&#34; She said signaling for some wine. &#34;Still not enough to peak the interest of anyone who Could bring your mate in but the glory of killing a Horned Wolf with the promise of immunity from retaliation I don&#39;t know.&#34; She mumbled. &#34;Don&#39;t leave our turf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll make sure to keep that in mind.&#34; I said nodding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-----Kaizen-----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made a bit of a mistake. That wine had me Drunk.  Willow was over there with Frankie, Wix&#39;s wife I sighed. She was just a few tables away, and all I had to do was get up, but they were conversing. I didn&#39;t want to interrupt. Fuck knows the beef was good though. I had my fourth plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your majesty, a word?&#34; Asked Wix, having a servant put a seat at our table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mind.&#34; I said obviously minding; he was interrupting my meal. However, I knew it was important and I couldn&#39;t be a pup about this. it was likely more bad news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First since you obviously have connections Good Ones I need a favor.&#34; He said interlacing his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get Jack to be rid of any you name.&#34; I said casually. &#34;Jack was good enough that even shadow warriors, wolves Bred to be assassins and spies couldn&#39;t catch him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I knew he was Good but not THAT good.&#34; He mumbled. &#34;I caught wind of my 8th and 9th seat trying to kill my nephew so they can move up a chair number. I&#39;m thinking, the best number they can be, is 6 feet under, as in the dirt.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. &#34;I assume since you wanted to speak with me, you likely attended a King&#39;s Council Meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;ve been to a few of those since you came here, but they don&#39;t know I have you. But if this goes south, your sister is the new Dragon Queen. Aureus killed his father, and said he&#39;d go to war if he had to for your sake.&#34; He said taking a sip of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s. really sweet of Grace, but she shouldn&#39;t worry about me.&#34; I grumbled. I was trouble for every family member it seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She will. She&#39;s your sister especially since now you&#39;re wanted dead or alive now, Both of you two hundred million each.&#34; He said with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t care I was wanted, but that he dragged Willow into this was too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He knows what he&#39;s doing.&#34; I said feeling sober. My blood literally boiled, and I could feel my true form threaten to appear. Fuck. There was also a small migraine that came with it. I had to fight this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here, chew this.&#34; He said handing me a cloth that smelled of unicorn&#39;s blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not taking any drugs.&#34; I said firmly. That was from a willing unicorn their fresh blood, even dried, sends supernaturals into a state of euphoria So it would stop my shifting, at the cost of my sanity. That&#39;s a risk I cannot take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then keep fighting it.&#34; Said Wix. &#34;If you change and ruin my venue, all these nobles will take that gossip, and spread it like dandelion seeds in the wind.&#34; He said truthfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That calmed me down enough to swallow this anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; are you *good* ?&#34; Wix asked in curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;m good.&#34; I said leaning back in my chair</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect, because I&#39;m not done.&#34; He said in Goblin. &#34;I put my neck out for you, He doesn&#39;t know you&#39;re here, but I think your mother does. She called me yesterday.&#34; He said putting his napkin in his pocket. He had a special case for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He may command her to spill it and then I&#39;ll have flocks of upstarts who want their big break after Willow&#34; I grumbled. Many wouldn&#39;t try me but if word got out she was human, she would be a target. So leaving Misfit Estates would be out. Those people for the most part swore in blood</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to worry about my people. We may like gold, but I made you My guest. To snitch on you, and make me a liar would make them My Target.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;But I suggest you stop taking out his council. If he gets killed, then I&#39;m sure with your sister as the Dragon Queen, you&#39;ll either get the crown, or a family member is going to, and pardon you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to drag everyone else into this.&#34; I mumbled. I looked at my mate. She looked serious too, but I don&#39;t think she knew the full gravity of this but Tyson still didn&#39;t know where she was.</p>
