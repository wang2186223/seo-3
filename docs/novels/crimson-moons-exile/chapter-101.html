                <p>A/N: I have a twitter now. It&#39;s @InueWindwalker. I haven&#39;t posted anything tbh, but I thought it would be kind of cool to talk to you guys More than just the comment section.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaizen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyson stood there, debating my words. He motioned me to move over a step, and stared Ink in the eyes. He stood there a long time linking this wolf. Without warning he threw his sword, and the blade spun, stopping at the head of the 11th seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His throne&#39;s top was cleaved from the backing, and the sword stopped only because behind the councilman was a wood wall It was Just above, even a hair lower, and Ken the Silent would have been beheaded. He got that name because his steps hold no sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m sure now he&#39;ll have that name for an additional reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyson knew what he was doing. He missed on purpose. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Take him; he will be more useful to you alive than burning Below.&#34; I said as a suggestion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, the 11th seat was put on his knees before his king.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had nothing to do with this my lord.&#34; Said the 11th Seat. He looked at the bodies of his fellow council members, and his thoughts betrayed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you knew. You made no effort to tell me, so I will make no effort to show mercy.&#34; He sneered. &#34;But I won&#39;t kill you I still need an odd number of seats. Hold his head.&#34; He commanded a random hyena shifter to hold the member down. He was strong enough to struggle, but the shifter frantically barked for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyson took his time getting there. He wanted him to squirm. They had Ken Right in front of the other Council, in front of Jang specifically. But I could tell he was broken a long time ago. Jang held his wrist, and a tattered, nearly hairless bracelet was stroked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I believe that was what was left of his wife. He was a threat to Queen Harmony when we were all still very young. Xaxas destroyed Jang&#39;s entire pack. Every soul, except his mate was reaped and judged. The small piece of pelt kept her soul with him, and he was too lonely and selfish to part with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mistake was fucking with Xaxas; Ken&#39;s was playing games with my brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your majesty I was going to tell you! I swear it.&#34; Ken begged, and I let my charge watch. This could have been him, had he waited, kept quiet, or did what was ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your voice annoys me.&#34; Tyson said with a low growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a moment&#39;s hesitation, he pulled out his tongue. He didn&#39;t use his claws. He manually pulled it. It stretched until it bluntly ripped, and he screamed. He wound up shifting, being unable to hold his form, or control. His wolf was belly up, not caring how shameful it was to submit so lowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since your tongue was tied, I loosened it for you. Because you thought inaction was the same as innocence, may you learn now that it Is NOT.&#34; Tyson hissed. &#34;Make sure he does not die. Get him out of my fucking sight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I ask you now, do any of you have any more games to play with a Horned Wolf?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt his anger, and it made me angered with him. The nerve of the lower houses. They do not work for the King. All they did was for themselves. Had there been any real truth to their work, I would have been inclined to speak up for them. They are blessed I shared my knowledge with Tyson. I&#39;m sure news like this would have made him kill them all, even the loyal ones like Alpha Ronitus of LapisMoon, the Second Seat Beta of RoyalMoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The response was silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My brother&#39;s warning should be heeded.&#34; He snarled. &#34;While we&#39;re here, we may as well finish the rest of the meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyson surprised all but Ronitus a second time. They thought he would be merciful, he was not Then they assumed they would be dismissed, yet, with a flick of his wrist, his sword returned to his hand, and a single swish cleaned it of blood. He marched back up to his spot, and I decided it was time to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My job in this room was to be a hand to help, and nothing else. The Crown Prince was likely in his mother&#39;s arms, or in a crib. I kind of wanted to see my nephew, but not while an assassin kneeled at my feet. Ink was no threat, but he could be taken as such.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drink my blood mortal, and be given mercy.&#34; I said biting my wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course master.&#34; Ink bowed. I kneeled to him, and let him become one of mine. I&#39;d added another to the fold. He didn&#39;t deserve death if he would break his oath to serve his king. Had Tyson been a little less bloodthirsty, he would have probably pardoned him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could have also just waited an hour or two for him to calm down, but instead I watched the life of this man. He was Good at his job, being on par with his teacher&#39;s pupils. He learned all he knew through Shadow Alpha Xavier, their elder, though I also saw in his memories that particular elder stepped down to retire. His younger brother Xander held ShadowMoon now, but that was all he knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their pack was small and secretive. It only had about 500 members, and they moved between 5 states on a rotation every 100 years. Long enough to establish themselves, but not long enough to get too attached. This male was ineligible to be an elder, since he was still active duty. However, had he retired, he&#39;d be on their Shadow Council.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He passed out and I caught him. I slung him over my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What will you do with him?&#34; Asked Ronitus, the Second Seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His son sat between him and Tyson. John was no longer in training, being older than me by a few decades, but his chair&#39;s position in that spot gives John permission to speak. Typically heirs to seats did not attend meetings, we had our own. Or should I say they? Mother technically didn&#39;t need an heir, being unable to die, but if she wanted me to take the position again, I would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you know, I hold Jack the Slasher. He is an undeveloped shadow, and needs a teacher. With Ink and Jack, I have two full fledged shadow wolves at my disposal. I borrow Eternya as my watchman. Since ink is neutralized, I think I&#39;ll see my nephew, Uncle Asanguis too if he&#39;s still here, and go home.&#34; I said sternly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyson smiled. &#34;When you do, bring my mate to me before you go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; I said leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me no time to find the Queen. She was in the gardens outside. Asanguis watched her, while the other Lunas of the Wolf Court held their meeting outside. He held little Lustros, who was too teeny-weeny to do anything more than crawl around on the grass when he was put down. It made me want to let him meet his cousins and all of them could have a playdate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>----Willow---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What am I going to do with you?&#34; I asked a little overwhelmed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They screamed bloody murder, but it was pretty cute They didn&#39;t want to be wet, but they made a bit of a mess of themselves. Vexterios  He missed the puppy pad after feeding and Aristaeus wiggled around and got himself covered head to toe in milk Gods they were so messy. My little one shivered on the towel while I tried to hurry up with his brother, but I didn&#39;t know where to start?! I put Aristaeus in my lap as best as I could to warm him, but I still had to deal with Vexterios. Damn it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d been messy before but this was ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tub&#39;s water was only an inch deep at the Most, because they were too small. I couldn&#39;t trust putting them in the tub They can&#39;t hold their breath yet, see, or hear well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had Aristaeus on a towel while I finished off Vexterios.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should have waited for Kaizen.&#34; Said Bryson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why WHY does everyone always pop up behind me?&#34; I complained. I jumped damn near out of my skin, and he chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry. Unlike the others, I teleport nearly blind. I felt the little ones were afraid. I came to check.&#34; He motioned them. Aristaeus was trying to escape. He was scooped up before he could leave the towel though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Thanks for the concern Do you think you could help? I told Eternya I could handle it.&#34; I said sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took off his shirt, and kneeled in front of the tub. He swished his hand around in the water. Bryson He kind of just felt like my dad. I was completely comfortable with him here, and honestly. I appreciated it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The water&#39;s a tad too hot, and little Ari is too cold. They can&#39;t really warm themselves up easily, not yet.&#34; He said with a soft smile. I saw his mark and the tattoo on his chest of a hammer in a circle. It pulsed red as he held his grandson I believe that was his symbol of godhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess I&#39;ll dry off Aristaeus and you can finish Vexterios.&#34; I giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no, I&#39;m *Grandpa*. That&#39;s *Your* job.&#34; He grinned. &#34;I&#39;m here to just monitor little Ari and Vexi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh damn it.&#34; I complained &#39;Ari and Vexi&#39; That was Cute but what wasn&#39;t was the mess my little one made. I thought I was done, but no, I wasn&#39;t. He decided now was the perfect time to use the toilet on me! He missed the puppy pad so badly While Ari was covered formally head to toe in cold water I thought I&#39;d dried him good enough.. &#34;Where do I even start?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryson chuckled as he dried Aristaeus. &#34;Get that washcloth and add the tear free soap. Never leave them in the water or put them in the tub if you&#39;re not Right there. They can&#39;t swim, and won&#39;t be able to until they&#39;re a little older.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right.&#34; I said following his instructions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, you take him and gently rub him down, using the rag to get more water. Here I&#39;ll take out the plug and run some warm fresh water.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vexterios complained, but I got him clean. It was hard to fight the urge to console him, but I pushed through. He was wrapped in a towel, and I waited for the next bit of instructions in case I needed to do something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s that?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect. Let me show you how to put them to bed a little easier.&#34;  Bryson said softly, and Clearly amused at this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently took Vexterios and put them both on the bed. He rubbed them between the horns until they stopped squeaking. Bryson&#39;s wolfspeach was deep and rich. He spoke with a passive authority that made you listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[There, there little ones.  You should speak to them in wolf speech about as much as you speak English When they come of age to go to school, they should be appointed an assistant who can write for them. They will learn so fast They will be so small, then one day they will be men, and you will miss the times when they fit in your hand.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed each on the top of their heads. &#34;I&#39;m glad I came. I know Kaizen is at the castle right now, and he speaks with his brother and sister-in-law.&#34;</p>
