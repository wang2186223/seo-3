                <p>A/N: I was going to scrap this, but it was too good to!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humblon</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did I run to my office Why did I come to my favorite world?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought I had more time with my mewmans. But as I sat in my office, they stood in front of me, irate and enraged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still want some compensation.&#34; Snarled my own brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do too.&#34; Said Zuviel. &#34;I understand both your feelings, however, he still cheated One. If we let him go free, it is a spit in our faces.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is I don&#39;t know what would appease you, but please my kings take from me what you wish.&#34; I said reluctantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I HATED THIS.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated that I had to say it I MUST. If I only get yelled at or a slap on the wrist It would make disorder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chaos from my action going unpunished would make the lower gods act up. So there must be compensation- Oh fucking no</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not Nayamya She heard their arguing, and my High Priestess came inside with a bow, and a light tap on the door. She was the first mewman I ever made. I didn&#39;t know what to do back then, so she has blue hair and yellow eyes like mine and she turns into a little 50 pound longhair tabby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am the High Priestess of the Lord of Mercy, Unity, and Purity.&#34; She bowed. &#34;I sense I am in the presence of ones higher than even my master, how exciting However I also sense hostility for Lord Torros, and the master.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This one is very pleasing, unfortunate we meet at such an ill time.&#34; Said Zuviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know who we are?&#34; Asked Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As high priestess, only I would know.&#34; She bowed, and curtsied. &#34;You are the master&#39;s brother, and the lord of Night and their wives.&#34; She mumbled. &#34;All I honestly know is that you are all above him Has my master offended you sir?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Greatly.&#34; They both said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We came for compensation.&#34; Said The Horned One. Oh no</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart sank. As a human I couldn&#39;t stop her I didn&#39;t realize she&#39;d heard anything, nor come</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did I make myself human? I KNEW that was a bad idea!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then.I offer myself.&#34; Said Nayamya. She shyly held the hem of her robes, but I knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s why they came. You cannot cheat them AND get away with it not forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO!&#34; I Screamed. &#34;You may have any world, anything in my larder but not my high priestess!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both looked at each other. I couldn&#39;t tell which one was the monster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hid on my favorite world. It only make sense they found my favorite mortal</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Husband no.&#34; Said Lia. &#34;Don&#39;t kill your little brother&#39;s plaything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought we were coming to pardon them.&#34; Said Lulliba.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are.&#34; They both said at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My butterfly there *must* be compensation. Losing something he loves unfortunately will be his punishment; I think it fair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do too.&#34; Said my brother. How could he agree.?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If even the Judge were here he would agree as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But of course he would He&#39;d side with his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be civil, she won&#39;t feel it.&#34; Said Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re making a mistake.&#34; Hissed Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agree. Just pardon them.&#34; Said Lulliba, a breath away from tears for me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the wave of Arviel&#39;s hand, Nayamya began to age I&#39;d made her the *only* one who was a true immortal because they are good. They don&#39;t do anything. They don&#39;t hurt anybody They laugh and smile and they don&#39;t think I&#39;m weird.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew I was lying to Just myself, that even *they* know I&#39;m weird, but at least they don&#39;t point it out.  I don&#39;t think I ever felt *this* upset</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Water fell from my eyes I didn&#39;t know the salt makes them sting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For nothing That she dies for nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Human emotion its weight is too great to bear. I would not wish them on my enemies</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got really old. and I cradled her. I did this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad I served you master Now I get to see Pergatori.&#34; She smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She won&#39;t That place won&#39;t exist soon, and they&#39;ll divvy up the spoils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nayamya for a pardon</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They could have this whole universe for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she does become Mercy the realm will still need to be remade So she&#39;ll never see any of my work</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I I don&#39;t wish to be Mercy Anymore.&#34; I said taking my powers out the corpse of my little kitten, and I let it sit on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let someone else do it. That was a stupid plan anyway. They will pick the next Humblon Plus if we both die as mortals, we&#39;ll end up in line together. Maybe I can apologize then If she&#39;ll even look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If any of them will. My death abandons themit unclaims them yet I couldn&#39;t bring myself to care as my bones became brittle, and my breath short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dying does hurt The Ailments Do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Humblon, that&#39;s ridiculous, get back to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not &#39;Humblon&#39; anymore. Go let someone else be your *brother*.&#34; I said turning 90. &#34;All you both do is want and take fuck everyone else so long as you have your way To be so big, you both behave so small.&#34; I even dared to glare at them, but Zuviel could care less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s serious you know.&#34; Said the Horned One unphased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;.You KNEW and you let me-&#34; Arviel was cut off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would I stop my enemy from making a mistake?&#34; He asked. &#34;Hurry up and die already. A Lesser Contradiction as Mercy could be interesting. I nominate Herculian&#39;s boy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is your mistake husband You&#39;re his brother yet the killing blow was from *your* hands.&#34; Said Lia as if I were already dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother I I didn&#39;t know it meant that much to you. I&#39;ll make you another one.&#34; Said Arviel as if we were somehow born mortals, and he broke my Mechatram Playset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just let me die Lord of Light. I guess if I&#39;m human I&#39;ll need a name What about Leopold. I always liked his music.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let myself spitefully die at 104. I held my Nayamya, who was dust. Huh I was in love with a mortal. The only one I couldn&#39;t save.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>------The Horned One----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well shit.&#34; I said in disbelief that he&#39;d *actually* give up godhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Plus I only did this on impulse!*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of Purgatory went The Fuck DOWN! I stopped it from just exploding and sending all the souls flying across the fucking cosmos!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His death pulse rang through every realm I forgot that he was *numbered*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together we had to stop time, and suspend every living mortal he&#39;s ever made in this temporary hold</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some died anyway, about 3% of all life died today. Even plants</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humblon killed more people than any one individual mortal I&#39;ve ever set loose</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cannot be allowed to stay dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was *my* fault for being so bloodthirsty so greedy for pain that I just couldn&#39;t help myself. Arviel is *so* easy to manipulate when he&#39;s pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made a Mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped the next wave that would have killed all his sentient life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humblon was considerate He gave his godhood a physical manifestation that I could contain He didn&#39;t want to nuke his people. Humblon probably even hoped we&#39;d spare his worlds. I will</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made it a ball, so it was easy to trap, but that he was gone meant that this would keep happening until this was resolved</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hold the souls of all my bloodline, but many he made still passed out momentarily while at their jobs which caused more to die on accident</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone&#39;s afterlives had surges in souls for just 2 seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all it took to disrupt the balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should have run a simulation first. But the thought of how upset they would be was too tempting not to try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit.&#34; Said Arviel. He managed to bring back some of the dead livestock. &#34;You can get up now. Ha Ha, mortal death, good times.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s really dead.&#34; I said unable to look at his corpse, and her dust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so greedy for pain that I didn&#39;t think of this...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck them both for cheating me. I wouldn&#39;t be this angered if they hadn&#39;t-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He isn&#39;t Dead.&#34; Snapped Arviel, taking me from my regretful thought. &#34;How many universes have-&#34; I cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you *dragged* him along?&#34; I said with a raised brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can remake him.&#34; Said Arviel. &#34;I can fix it if he fucking lets me. Why won&#39;t he?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was my heart doing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not understand this, but I did understand what I&#39;d done I&#39;d have punished anyone else for such *childish* behavior</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humblon stood in line to be judged. He held the hand of his beloved little priestess</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That is the same love I have for my high Priest Gulteer, The Witch King, but more like the Little Shit I would not take his death well at all either. I remember forging him from my own blood and a little dirt</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only once has he ever angered me. Beyond that, he and his seeds sing my praise and feed me my fill..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think this feeling is compassion. Maybe? I do not feel this moved often. I don&#39;t really feel anything most of the time. I have shit to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh what have I done?&#34; Arviel, the King of Half There Is, fell to his knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did not outright kill his brother, but his hand delivered the killing blow for so manymany mortals</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt pity for him, looking at my priest *Rip Some Mortal the Fuck Apart*. How proud he makes me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is why Gulteer is, even now, my second favorite mortal... I could not offer anyone that precious up as Humblon did but he did that because he knew nothing else would satisfy *me*, not Arviel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arviel was just a big brother who smashed his brother&#39;s Laggo Blocks. He&#39;s a meathead when he&#39;s this mad</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glare of red eyes changed the room to its unearthly hue but it wasn&#39;t me or my sons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lulliba was red tinted tarnished silver, while her little eyes looked like mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d never seen such anger from one so small, but it wasn&#39;t amusing She was actually kind of fucking scary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How DARE YOU!&#34; She screamed. &#34;Both of you Are Selfish SHITS!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were owed. Don&#39;t get too proud!&#34; Yelled Arviel like a father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*SLAP*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;THAT&#39;S WHAT YOU&#39;RE OWED!&#34; Lulliba slapped him, borrowing the energy she&#39;d absorbed from my throne on accident</p>
