                <p>At exactly 7:30, just as the security guard was preparing to lock up forthe night, Kayla slipped out of the building in the nick of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered her a gentle, fatherly smile. &#34;If you ever end up working late again,let me know ahead of time.Wouldn&#39;t want you getting stuck inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, sir,&#34; Kayla murmured as she stepped into the evening air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a conspiratorial grin, the guard gestured toward the curb. &#34;Your husband has been waiting out there for quite a while now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla halted as she spotted Liam emerging from his car,a bouquet of fresh flowers resting in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t budge, her features frosted over as she regarded him in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight,Liam looked nothing like his usual imposing self. The harsh edges of his presence had vanished,leaving only a quiet gentleness behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting moment, Kayla was swept back to their school days-memories of Liam waiting for her outside the classroom every afternoon,always holding a bright bundle of flowers. Her friends had watched with envy, whispering that she must be the luckiest girl in the world to have someone so thoughtful at her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After college, Liam had gone against Janiya&#39;s wishes and stubbornly insisted on marrying Kayla. Back then,their classmates couldn&#39;t stop gushing about what a catch he was-a golden boy who seemed to have it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Liam drew closer now, Kayla shook herself free from the haze of nostalgia. The memories were golden, almost too bright to bear, but that happiness belonged to another life. There was no going back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla, congrats on your new job. I brought these for you,&#34; Liam remarked, his voice warm as he held out the bouquet with a hopeful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla refused to take the flowers. Her tone turned icy as she demanded, &#34;Liam, what are you doing? Are you really putting on another show?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just wanted to pick you up from work, that&#39;s all.&#34; His smile faltered, but he forced sincerity into his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla turned away, a scornful smile curving her lips.&#34;So, what is it this time? Need me to cozy up to some big shot again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s chest rose as he inhaled sharply. When he met her gaze again, he looked almost wounded. &#34;Kayla,we&#39;ve been through so much lately. I know l&#39;ve messed up, but I swear, I&#39;m trying to do better. I reserved a table for us-let me take you to dinner.&#34; &#34;Save it.&#34; Kayla brushed his hand aside, sending the bouquet tumbling to the pavement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flowers hit the ground in a vivid spray of petals.As they scattered, a small bottle slipped free and rolled until it bumped against the tip of Kayla&#39;s shoe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced down, catching the label-Liam&#39;s familiar stomach medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s stubbornness with his medication had always been a headache.Even back in school, Kayla used to chase him down just to make sure he took it. After marriage, nothing had changed-she still had to practically force the pills into his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes met his with a frosty, indifferent stare. &#34;Are you seriously trying to play the sympathy card now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping his gaze, Liam let out a hollow, humorless laugh. He stooped to pick up the small bottle,weighing it in his palm with a strange tenderness. &#34;This was the first bottle you ever handed me.I never had the heart to throw it out. I&#39;ve just been refilling it all these years. But if you&#39;re walking out on me now,what&#39;s the point in holding onto it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he flicked the bottle into the trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s expression didn&#39;t waver. &#34;What are you up to this time, Liam? Trying to guilt-trip me into staying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a sleek black Rolls-Royce glided down the street. Seated inside, Edwin leaned forward and urged the driver to pull over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peering out the window, Edwin pointed ahead.&#34;Mr.Graham, isn&#39;t that Kayla and Liam up there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy, who had been resting with his eyes closed,cracked one eye open and followed Edwin&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the sidewalk, Kayla and Liam stood opposite each other, their postures stiff, the distance between them thick with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Liam pulled Kayla into a desperate hug, anguish written all over his face as he pleaded with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin couldn&#39;t hide his nosy curiosity. &#34;You think Kayla might actually forgive him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy cut him off with a frosty glare that made the air inside the car drop a few degrees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin swallowed his next words&#39;and sank quietly back in his seat, instantly silenced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s attention returned to the unfolding scene just in time to see Kayla shove Liam away and jab a finger at him, her voice sharp with reproach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Liam crumpled to the pavement, his features twisted in agony. Kayla hurried to support him,hauling him into her car before speeding off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy watched in stony silence, not blinking until their car vanished around the corner. Only then did he speak, his tone low and steely. &#34;Drive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Kayla&#39;s foot pressed harder on the accelerator, tires humming as the city blurred by. She shot Liam a sidelong glance, her tone clipped.&#34;Should I take you to the hospital now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam shook his head, skin clammy and eyes strained.He pointed weakly toward the windshield. &#34;It&#39;s too far.Go straight, then turn right. I keep some medicine nearby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh of impatience slipped from Kayla&#39;s lips. If not for the last, stubborn trace of guilt, she might&#39;ve dumped him on the curb the moment his stomach twisted in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s gaze softened, lingering on her face.&#34;Kayla,do you remember back in college? Whenever I had a stomachache, you always rushed over. I can&#39;t forget those days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla pressed two fingers to her temple, the irony grating. There was a time she would&#39;ve melted at his sentimental routine. Now, his nostalgia barely registered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam tried again, voice gentle. &#34;Kayla, do you remember-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say another word and I&#39;ll make sure you can&#39;t speak for a week.&#34; With a screech of brakes, Kayla swung the car up to the curb outside a small restaurant. &#34;Call someone for your medicine. I&#39;m done here.&#34; She barely finished the sentence before a sudden,thunderous &#34;bang&#34; shattered the air overhead.</p>
