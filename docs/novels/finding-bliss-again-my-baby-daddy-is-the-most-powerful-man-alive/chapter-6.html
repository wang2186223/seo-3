                <p>&#34;Mr. Graham.&#34; Tricia rushed into the office,clutching a thick stack of documents. Her eyes flicked toward Kayla with a smug glint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam,barely keeping his temper in check,lowered his voice.&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;North Investment turned us down. They sent back the invitation letter and all the project documents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;UJseless!&#34; he snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perennia Group was in a bind-deep in financial trouble and fast running out of options. North Investment, the powerhouse of Trark&#39;s investment scene, had the means to turn things around in a heartbeat if they got involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The head of North Investment was his uncle, and Liam had assumed that being family would be enough to secure their support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia paused for a mnoment, then asked, &#34;Mr. Graham,what now? If we don&#39;t get the funds soon, Perennia Group is done for.&#34; Liam turned to look at Kayla. Back in the early days,she&#39;d been the one to bring in most of the company&#39;s big deals. Calm, sharp, relentless-she made things happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snatched the documents from Tricia and flung them toward Kayla. &#34;Didn&#39;t you want a divorce? If you can get North Investment on our side,I&#39;ll think about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla snatched the documents and shot him a firm look. &#34;You&#39;d better mean it. Don&#39;t you dare go back on your word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, she turned and left with the documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the door clicked shut, Tricia stepped closer,clutching Liam&#39;s arm. &#34;How can you count on her? If you couldn&#39;t convince them, what makes you think she can?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam shoved her off and barked, &#34;Don&#39;t cling to me at work. If Kayla finds out what&#39;s going on between us,I&#39;ll make sure you regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia froze, her face turning pale. Her expression turned brittle as shepouted.&#34;Why would you say that?She&#39;s already done with you. If she loved you,she wouldn&#39;t be walking away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s jaw tightened. He gave her a sharp look. &#34;I don&#39;t care what you think. Kayla is the only woman I&#39;ve ever loved. And if it weren&#39;t for your games, I&#39;d never have gotten invoved with you in the first place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears gathered in Tricia&#39;s eyes as she gripped the documents tightly, her knuckles white from the strain</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam loosened his tie, exhaling sharply. &#34;Leave.I don&#39;t want to see you right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia bit her lower lip, fighting the sting behind her eyes. &#34;Yes, Mr. Graham.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She backed out and closed the door behind her, then stood just outside, her face twisting with bitterness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did Kayla have that she didn&#39;t? Why did he still look at her like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At a quiet cafe down the street, Kayla sat with the project files spread out in front of her.Her brows were furrowed in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy,the CEO of North Investment, wasn&#39;t going to be easy. He was smart, guarded, and far from sentimental.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with the way things stood, she didn&#39;t have the luxury of backing off. She had to try As she stared at the pages, wondering where to begin,the low rumble of an engine caught her attention.Across the road, a black Rolls-Royce glided to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened. Jeremy stepped out, flanked by a few associates, and headed into the bar across the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla pursed her lips, grabbed her bag, and went after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bar was buzzing. Music thumped, people laughed loudly, and drinks flowed without pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise and smell turned her stomach, but she pushed through them. As she made her way toward the private rooms upstairs, security stepped in and blocked her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t go up there. Turn around,please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here to see someone,&#34; she replied quickly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, the guards grabbed her shoulders,already steering her back toward the door</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, from the corner of her eye, Kayla noticed a tall figure standing in the hallway. Taking a deep breath,she gathered her courage and called out,&#34;Jeremy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy stopped in his tracks and glanced back at her, his face calm and unreadable</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards froze, clearly caught off guard. She knew Jeremy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They let go of her instantly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t waste a second. She hurried over with a bright, overly sweet smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t move, hands tucked in his pockets,eyeing her with quiet suspicion. Last time they crossed paths, she had seemed to be walking on eggshells.Now she was suddenly all smiles? It didn&#39;t add up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jeremy! What a surprise! I was just passing by and spotted you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t respond. He simply turned and walked into one of the private rooms withouta word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla faltered at the doorway. Was she supposed to go in? After a second of uncertainty, se followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the room, the first thing she noticed was the man in the red shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Buddy, who&#39;s this beauty? Don&#39;t tell me she&#39;s your new flame.&#34; Dewitt Nicolson smirked, mischief lacing his voice as he threw a glance Jeremy&#39;s way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy said nothing, sinking into the seat at the  center of the room and ignoring Kayla&#39;s presence</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt kept staring His eyes narrowed slightly, as though something had clicked in his mind. &#34;Wait a second..I know that face Where have I have seen it before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, he smacked his thigh as it clicked &#34;That&#39;s it! I saw you at some banquet-you&#39;re Liam&#39;s wife. So what brings you here with Jeremy tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed out loud, but Jeremy shot him a sharp look that shut him up immediately</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, I&#39;m Kayla,&#34; Kayla said, introducing herself with calm composure</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t care about the teasing or the assumptions This meeting mattered too much. She needed Jeremy&#39;s help if she was ever going to end things cleanly with Liam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mind if I sit here?&#34; she asked, gesturing to a seat near Jeremy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave,&#34; Jeremy said, flat and cold</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt raised his hands in mock protest. &#34;Aw, don&#39;t be so heartless. She&#39;s family, isn&#39;t she? Let her stay. She&#39;s not hurting anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to steady herself,Kayla sat down-nervous,but  determined</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t even glance her way, acting like she wasn&#39;t there at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Dewitt? He was watching her closely, grinning to himself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation was full of irony and entertainment.Jeremy had never hidden his disdain for Liam,and now here he was, in a room with Liam&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla was just about to say something when Edwin walked into the room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a small nod. &#34;Mr. Graham, we&#39;ve found information about the woman from that night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s heart dropped. Her fingers curled tightly around the hem of her dress. Suddenly,the room felt too small, the air too heavy. Her instinct screamed at her to run.</p>
