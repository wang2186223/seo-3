                <p>Kayla stepped into Jeremy&#39;s car once more, her nerves still present but not as intense as before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive passed in silence, neither of them speaking until they pulled up in front of her apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she reached for the door handle, her phone slipped from her grasp, landing by Jeremy&#39;s feet. She leaned over to retrieve it, and her head brushed awkwardly against his leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy stiffened instantly, and Kayla&#39;s face burned with embarrassment. She looked up, flustered.&#34;1&#34;m sorry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With deliberate slowness, Jeremy took her chin in his hand. His gaze was unreadable, his voice low. &#34;Trying to seduce me now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color rushed to her cheeks. &#34;No! It&#39;s not like that. My phone just...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up the phone and handed it to her. &#34;Do that again, and you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla snatched it from his hand, but in her haste, her arm tugged at his jacket, pulling him forward unexpectedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stumbled into her, his body pressing hers firmly against the seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Graham, we&#39;ve arrived,&#34; the driver announced, glancing back, freezing at the sight of their uncomfortable position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s breath caught in her throat as.she clutched Jeremy&#39;s collar. Their eyes met, charged with tension and lingering confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whose car is blocking the road?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A middle-aged woman stormed up behind the car, eyes narrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla shoved Jeremy away and leapt from the car, dashing into the building like she couldn&#39;t get away fast enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That girl&#39;s in a real hurry,&#34; the woman muttered, approaching the vehicle. She caught Jeremy&#39;s icy stare and swallowed hard. Flashing an awkward smile, she asked, &#34;You single, handsome?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy rolled the window up without sparing her a glance. &#34;Drive,&#34; he told the driver flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car took off in a rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman he left behind muttered under her breath, &#34;These young men nowadays-no manners at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at her apartment, Kayla still felt shaken. She took a shower to calm her nerves, popped a prenatal vitamin, then curled up in bed with a parenting guide in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she couldn&#39;t concentrate-her thoughts were all over the place. With a sigh of frustration, she flung the book away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts circled around Jeremy-every interaction they had. She&#39;d planned to keep him at a distance,but somehow, they kept drawing closer, and that closeness made her restless, like she was bracing for something she couldn&#39;t name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She realized she needed to leave the city-and quickly. She couldn&#39;t afford to wait any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having made up her mind, Kayla switched off the lights and settled into bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By morning, she was dressed and out the door right after breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She arrived at the courthouse just as the doors were opening, becoming the first person to file for divorce that day.Liam arrived moments later, punctual as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in a crisp white tweed suit, her makeup flawless and refined, Kayla sat poised on a bench, waiting in composed silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Liam walked in, his gaze locked on her. For a second, admiration flashed in his eyes. He started walking over to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without sparing him a glance, Kayla rose and headed for the divorce registration desk. Liam trailed behind, his voice lowered. &#34;Are you really sure this is the end?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned, her eyes like ice.-&#34;Ifyour public image means anything to you, sit down and keep quiet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night before, Jeremy had the trending story wiped out in record time. But Janiya and Liam understood-if they dared to back out,he could make it explode across every headline in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam dropped into a chair, his face tense and pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clerk glanced between them and asked, &#34;So, you&#39;re filing on mutual grounds?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Kayla answered without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any disagreement on property division?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla paused. Other than reclaiming the Cooper Group, she had no interest in anything else Liam owned.Her agreement with Archie was nearing its end-soon, the company would be hers again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No disagreements,&#34; Liam said. &#34;I&#39;ll hand over some of my properties and cars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla smirked. Those suburban fixer-uppers and beat-up cars of Liam&#39;s? Barely worth pocket change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clerk nodded and passed them the documents to sign. &#34;Everything&#39;s in motion. Just a reminder-there&#39;s a thirty-day grace period. Either of you can withdraw the application within that time. Any objections?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla felt a flicker of annoyance at the reminder, but she brushed it aside. Thirty days would pass quickly.Once done, she&#39;d be officially free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No objections,&#34; she said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well,&#34; the clerk replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside,Liam caught up with her, his tone laced with smugness. &#34;You&#39;ve got a month to think things over. If you change your mind, you know where to find me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stopped, folded her arms, and turned to face him with a sly smile.11Amonth? That&#39;s nothing.And while we&#39;re at it, remember that cemetery project you&#39;ve been working on? I tipped off your competitors. They&#39;re most likely scheming behind your back already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s expression twisted. &#34;What the hell are you trying to pull?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a knowing smile, Kayla flagged down a cab and stepped inside, leaving without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s phone buzzed. His assistant&#39;s voice came through, urgent.′′Sir1, the cemetery project&#39;s been exposed. Competitors bribed the landowners. If we go through with the sale, they&#39;ll hit Perennia Group with a breach of contract lawsuit-this could cost us over a hundred million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething with rage, Liam hurled his phone to the ground, shattering it. &#34;This is unbelievable!&#34;</p>
