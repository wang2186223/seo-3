                <p>Kayla stepped back into the private lounge where Marley and the others were gathered. Everyone was waiting for Zoe to come back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room pulsed with whispers. &#34;Is she actually bringing Jeremy in here? Seriously? Could be all talk.Maybe she&#39;s bluffing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marley gave a lazy shrug. &#34;Let&#39;s just wait. We&#39;ll know soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla made for the door, but they blocked her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still steaming from earlier, Marley strutted over in her stilettos, a bitter smirk on her lips. &#34;You must be the sad little sister Zoe&#39;s always talking about. So what if you overheard us in the bathroom? You think Zoe&#39;s going to take your word over ours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla shot her a bored glance, her eyes drifting over Marley like she wasn&#39;t worth a second thought. Trash always had a way of sticking with its own kind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whether she believes me or not doesn&#39;t matter,&#34;Kayla said coolly. &#34;I heard everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marley crossed her arms, her smug grin widening. &#34;No wonder Zoe&#39;s always complaining about you. Your mom was a bitch, and you&#39;re just like her.&#34; The mention of her mother snapped something inside Kayla. Her fists clenched tight, her expression hardening like stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another girl chimed in, barely hiding her grin.&#34;Zoe said her mom cheated. That&#39;s why her parents divorced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marley added with a smirk, &#34;If her mom was like that,what do you expect from her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s fury ignited in a flash. She stepped forward and slapped Marley so fast. The loud crack echoed through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marley stumbled back, grabbing her cheek,eyes wide.&#34;Did you just hit me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Zoe walked in with Jeremy. She rushed to Marley and threw her arms in front of her like a shield.&#34;Kayla! How could you hit my friend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t hesitate. She turned and landed another slap-this one on Zoe. Harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe stumbled back a few steps, eyes glistening as tears welled up. She stared at Kayla, stunned. &#34;Why would you hit me like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a shaky step back, staring at Kayla like the injured lead in a drama, then turned to Jeremy, silently pleading.Jeremy stood still, hands in his pockets, not saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You talk way too much.&#34; Kayla grabbed a throw pillow off the couch and hurled it straight at Zoe. Her aim was sharp-her so-called friends caught some of it too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Screams erupted as chaos broke loose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t stop. She charged, cornering in seconds,swinging the pillow over and over again. Makeup smeared, someone&#39;s contact lens popped out,and the room turned into a mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy watched from the side, clearly uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla looked like a storm set loose. Whatever strength she had, it surged now. One by one,the girls backed down, slinking to the floor, begging her to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally,Kayla stopped herself-remembering the baby.She grabbed a wine bottle from the table and smashed it against the floor in front of them. &#34;Say one more word about my mom, and next time, it won&#39;t be a pillow. It&#39;ll be your face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned, walking straight past Jeremy without a glance. Zoe staggered to her feet, hair tangled, dress torn,sniffles loud and pitiful. She limped over to Jeremy,eyes glassy. &#34;Why is she acting like this? She hit me so hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t have all the facts, but he knew Kayla.She wasn&#39;t reckless. If she lost it, something must&#39;ve pushed her too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Zoe without emotion. &#34;If you came here.to have fun, then stick to that. Don&#39;t drag drama into it. I&#39;m covering the tab tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned and walked away, never once glancing back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe stood frozen, her mouth slightly open, watching him disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marley rushed over, still holding her face. &#34;Wait, I thought you said he was your boyfriend! Why didn&#39;t he help us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s expression twisted, rage bubbling up. &#34;Because of you idiots! Why would you start something with Kayla? This was my chance to talk to him, and you blew it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marley stared at her. &#34;We ruined it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering Jeremy was hanging out with his friends next door, Zoe took a long breath to calm down.&#34;Fine. Whatever. It&#39;s my fault. Kayla&#39;s been losing it lately. She&#39;s unhinged. Don&#39;t mess with her again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, under the glow of the club sign, Jeremy stepped out and spotted Kayla waiting by the curb for a ride. He walked up quietly behind her, hands in his pockets.&#34;Want a lift?&#34;</p>
