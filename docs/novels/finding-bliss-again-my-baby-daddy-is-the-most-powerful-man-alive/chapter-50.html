                <p>Johnny,who seldom stepped beyond the confines of his home, made an unexpected appearance that caught everyone off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though well into his seventies, he radiated warmth and a seasoned sharpness.Energy coursed through him,and in his eyes-so similar to Jeremy&#39;s-rested the quiet command of someone long accustomed to power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was once hailed as a titan in the corporate arena,but over time,he had gradually withdrawn,passing the reins of the family businesses to his only son,Jeremy.Still, whispers persisted about friction between the two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla froze where she stood as they drew closer,knowing instinctively this wasn&#39;t the moment to slip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a composed nod and said, &#34;Good evening,Mr. Graham.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their paths had last crossed at the wedding; this marked only their second meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny studied her for a brief moment, then offered a nod. &#34;Quite some time has passed, hasn&#39;t it?&#34; From inside the house, Liam caught the stir and burst out, clearly rattled. &#34;Grandpa, Mom, what brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny took a slow look around the villa and asked,&#34;What was that racket a moment ago?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting uncomfortably, Liam replied, &#34;It&#39;s nothing serious, Grandpa. Just a minor disagreement between Kayla and me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny didn&#39;t respond. He had heard more than a few tales about Liam, but he&#39;d learned to let such talk drift past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya walked up to Liam, her voice lined with mock disapproval as she clutched his arm. &#34;Liam, your grandfather doesn&#39;t visit often. You should&#39;ve come out to welcome him. That&#39;s completely inappropriate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam lowered his head, voice apologetic. &#34;I apologize.I should&#39;ve been more mindful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight nod, Johnny, steadying himself on a servant&#39;s arm, moved toward the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Janiya scanned the disorder inside the bedroom and caught sight of Tricia sprawled on the floor,her expression darkened. She yanked Liam aside and said between clenched teeth,&#34;Clean this up. It took a lot to bring your grandfather here. Don&#39;t let this fall apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| know, Mom,&#34; Liam said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to the staff, directing them to help Tricia Fit and summon a doctor, making sure nothing disturbed Johnny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing nearby, Kayla watched the mother and son act concerned, her stomach turning. Clearly, they were ashamed to let Tricia be in Johnny&#39;s presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liam, Kayla, come,&#34; Johnny called from the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam gave a quick nod and stepped forward, but Kayla stayed where she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya reached out and grabbed her arm and said sharply, &#34;Kayla, listen to me. My father&#39;s the head of the Graham family. He values dignity above all else.Be careful what you say around him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla shot back, voice laced with bitterness, &#34;It&#39;s your son who&#39;s dragged the family through the mud.Yet here you are, lecturing me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya&#39;s expression tightened. &#34;Watch yourself. My father&#39;s heart isn&#39;t strong. If something happens and he gets sick, Jeremy won&#39;t let you off the hook.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Jeremy, a flick of emotion passed through Kayla&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough, Mom,&#34; Liam said firmly, tugging Kayla forward, though she resisted with every step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servants brought out drinks and light refreshments, then quietly exited, pulling the villa doors shut behind them. Just as Liam moved closer to Johnny, a sudden roar broke the silence. &#34;Kneel!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The command jolted Liam. He dropped to the floor,knees hitting the marble with a loud thump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla,watching from the side, had to admit-Liam wasted no time showing submission in front of his grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny reached for the cane resting nearby and brought it down hard across Liam&#39;s back. &#34;Look at what you&#39;ve done. You&#39;ve brought shame on yourself and the family. Kayla wanted a real future with you,and this is how you repay her? There&#39;s no place in this family for someone like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s brow creased at Johnny&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had only seen Johnny once before, and like Janiya,he had seemed dismissive of her upbringing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She assumed the Graham family would welcome her separation from Liam, but now Johnny stood up for her, and she couldn&#39;t quite make sense of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering his head, Liam murmured, &#34;Grandpa, I understand. I&#39;ll accept whatever punishment you see fit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya rushed forward, eyes glossy. &#34;Dad, if someone must take the blame, let it be me. I failed to raise him right. All of this is my fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny responded by striking Liam again,the repeated</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fit blows draining the color from his face. Liam clenched his fists, clearly in pain, but said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla remained indifferent, silently observing the performance. She knew Janiya wouldn&#39;t have brought Johnny here without a motive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she stood unmoved, Johnny turned to her and signaled with his hand. &#34;Kayla, I know you&#39;ve endured a lot. Come please.&#34;</p>
