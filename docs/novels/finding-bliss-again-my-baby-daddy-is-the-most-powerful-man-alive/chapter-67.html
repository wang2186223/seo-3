                <p>Kayla was out cold, lost to the world no matter how many times Jeremy tried to shake her awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the curb, one of the bodyguards hovered by the open car door, asking, &#34;Mr. Graham, should we carry Her upstairs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy shot him a look and nodded curtly. &#34;Send her home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34; The bodyguard moved in, trying to be helpful but ended up gripping Kayla right on her injured arm. Even in her sleep, pain flickered across her face and she let out a faint whimper, brow knotting in discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s patience snapped. &#34;Would it kill you to be careful?&#34; His words came out sharp, slicing through the night air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flustered, the bodyguard stepped back,mumbling,&#34;Sorry, Mr. Graham. Maybe you should do it? She might get hurt if we keep trying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Jeremy stooped down and swept Kayla into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla shifted unconsciously, nestling closer against his chest, as if searching for comfort even in her dreams. With her unit number already in mind, Jeremy carried her all the way to her home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the space was small but inviting, the. soft lamplight revealing neatly stacked work papers and the faintest hint of lavender in the air. Hle noticed the pile of paperwork on the dining table,evidence of her endless late nights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cradling her, Jeremy stepped into the bedroom,pushed aside a scatter of plush pink toys at the head of her bed, and set her down tenderly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jeremy turned to leave, Kayla, half-lost in sleep,instinctively latched onto his hand and y/anked him off balance.He toppled onto the mattress beside her, his weight making the bed dip with a dull thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma, don&#39;t go,&#34; Kayla murmured,eyes squeezed shut, her words tangled with the haze of a dream.Even in sleep, she reached for the only person who had ever made her feel truly safe-her grandmother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy caught himself with one hand pressed firmly into the mattress, careful not to crush the girl clinging to him. Her fingers locked tight around his own,refusing to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a shrill ringtone cut through the quiet,Kayla&#39;s phone buzzing from somewhere in the folds of her blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy tried to wriggle free, reaching awkwardly for the phone, but Kayla rolled over, pinning his hand Night under her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla, let go,&#34; he growled, his mouth close to her ear,his voice low and cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla, blissfully oblivious, only nuzzled deeper into her dreams, the faintest smile curving her lips</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no other choice, Jeremy lay stuck, trapped by the Kayla&#39;s stubborn grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes dragged into hours, each second testing his patience. At last, after what felt like an eternity, Kayla shifted in her sleep, rolling away and releasing his numb hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had he pulled free than her phone started ringing again, the persistent call slicing through the room every ten minutes, as relentless as a ticking clock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy snatched up the phone, his eyes flicking to the caller ID-&#34;Dummy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t need to guess; that was Liam&#39;s number,without a doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla,still half-lost in sleep, groaned at the relentless ringing and yanked the blanket over her head, trying to block out the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Switching off her phone, Jeremy slipped out of the bedroom and flexed his tingling hand, working the feeling back as he made his way down the stairs and out to the waiting car. The bodyguard at the curb eyed him with concern.&#34;Are you alright, Mr. Graham?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy, ever composed, tucked his hand behind his back and kept his expression unreadable. &#34;I&#39;m fine.Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, the car eased away from the curb,melting into the qquiet of the early morning streets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t stir until midday, when the crash and thud of her neighbor&#39;s home renovation rattled through the walls and dragged her back to consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squinted at the bedside clock, bolting upright in alarm. &#34;It&#39;s noon?&#34; Pain jolted through her injured arm as she moved too fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch.&#34; Cautiously, Kayla checked the wound-no fresh blood, just the faint sting of healing. Relieved,she pushed herself up, swept back the curtains, and let sunlight spill across room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night flickered through her mind in fragments-Jeremy taking her to the hospital, then... nothing. The rest was a blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he actually carry me upstairs?&#34; she murmured,half amused, half disbelieving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, unable to piece together the gap in her memory, and finally let it go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed her phone, realized it was off, and nowered it back on, Instantly, aa torrent of missed calls from Liam flashed across the screen. HHe&#39;d clearly found ways to pester her using every number he could get his hands on, block list or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla rolled her eyes and tossed the phone aside,determined to ignore him. After a quick shower and a change into fresh clothes, she was just about to head out when her phone rang again. This time, Archie&#39;s name flashed across the display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla, I heard you ran into some trouble at the hotel last night,&#34; Archie said, his voice laced with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla blinked, caught off guard. &#34;How&#39;d you find out so fast? But I&#39;m fine, really-just a little hiccup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re not feeling well, take it easy. Work can wait,&#34;Archie replied, sounding unusually gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla hesitated, eyebrows arching in surprise. &#34;Did Jeremy tell you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet chuckle rumbled through the phone.&#34;So,he was with you last night? I only got a text this morning saying you&#39;d been hurt and should take a few days off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taken aback,Kayla could only laugh awkwardly. &#34;I just happened to run into him, that&#39;s all. There&#39;s nothing more to it. I can work today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Archie wouldn&#39;t budge. &#34;He personally asked me to give you leave. I don&#39;t want our partners thinking |work my people to the bone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing she&#39;d lost this round, Kayla sighed,agreeing to take the day off and promising herself she&#39;d return to work tomorrow if she felt up to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before hanging up, Archie cleared his throat, suddenly sounding far too interested. &#34;Kayla, what&#39;s really going on between you and Jeremy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s heart skipped a beat, and she blurted out,′′Vjust crossed paths last night, that&#39;s all. Nothing else.&#34;</p>
