                <p>Jeremy acted fast. He pulled Kayla into his arms and turned his back to the doorway, shielding her completely from view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held her close, pressing her firmly to his chest. She could feel his heartbeat-strong and steady,pounding right beneath her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t dare breathe too loudly. Her heart thudded in her chest as she stood frozen in his embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anyone saw them like this, rumors would spread like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe walked in, only to be met with the shocking sight of Jeremy holding another woman. Her eyes widened,and the tray in her hands slipped from her grasp,crashing loudly to the floor. She slapped a hand over her mouth, completely stunned. &#34;What is going on here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t move or even glance her way. His voice was icy. &#34;Get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe stood there, stunned. Her emotions spiraled out of control as anger took over. It felt like a punch to the gut-like betrayal from someone she trusted deeply. She pointed at him, shouting, &#34;What are you doing with her? Is this how you repay me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words grated on Jeremy&#39;s nerves. His expression tightened, his voice turning even colder. &#34;Get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s rage boiled over intowounded pride. &#34;Who even is this woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;This is the last time I&#39;ll tell you.Get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s anger gave way to pain and humiliation, and tears filled her eyes. She turned and ran out of the room, covering her face with her hand as sobs escaped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the door closed behind her, Kayla stepped back quickly, freeing herself from Jeremy&#39;s arms. Her face was flushed with embarrassment, and she avoided his gaze. &#34;Sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy dropped his hands calmly, as if nothing had happened. &#34;No need to apologize. There&#39;s nothing going on between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>StilI flustered, Kayla nodded quickly and brushed past him,lowering her head. &#34;I should get going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was now quiet with Jeremy standing there alone. He tugged at his tie, his face expressionless,but the heat rising in his chest gave him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever he was near Kayla, a strange kind of tension 1ould huild inside him-an uneasy energy that pressed against the surface, desperate to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had always taken pride in keeping his emotions in check,but around her, that control slipped away as if it had never existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Edwin stepped inside. &#34;Mr. Graham, Zoe just ran out of the building in tears. She&#39;s outside right now and looks very upset. Should I check on her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy rubbed his temple with a sigh. His tone was cool, without any sign of emotion. &#34;Take her home.Give her whatever she wants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin gave a quick nod and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe,despite her heartbreak, didn&#39;t hesitate to accept the benefits Jeremy provided. Deep down,she believed that no matter who else he grew close to,he owed her something-and she wasn&#39;t going to let go of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the car, she tried coaxing information out of Edwin -anything about the woman she had seen in Jeremy&#39;s arms-but he kept his mouth shut. She couldn&#39;t get a single detail out of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, Zoe arrived at the most luxurious hot spring hotel, where she had arranged a spa day with her closest friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After spending time in the steaming pools, she emerged glowing, surrounded by friends who fawned over her. &#34;You&#39;re so lucky, Zoe. A rich, powerful boyfriend like Jeremy? And you even brought us along? This place is ridiculously expensive!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe, feeling smug, smiled proudly. &#34;I believe in sharing the good life. Some people used to spread rumors that my relationship with Jeremy wasn&#39;t real, but l guess I&#39;m proving them wrong now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her friends exchanged knowing glances, offering smiles filled with flattery. &#34;Those people were clearly just jealous.Jeremy obviously cares for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course he does. But I never forget the people who&#39;ve been with me along the way.&#34; Zoe walked confidently up to the front desk, pulled out a gold card from her purse, and handed it over. &#34;Charge everything to this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her friends gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gold card-something few people in Trark had ever even seen. It was only given to the city&#39;s elite, and Jeremy had personally given it to Zoe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, Zoe brimmed with pride, pleased with the attention. As the bill was taken care of, Zoe stepped over to a lounge chair to fix her lipstick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But nearby, the hotel manager and his assistant sat talking in hushed voices. &#34;The higher-ups just issued a directive,&#34; the assistant said. &#34;We need to look into every guest who stayed on the 33rd floor last month.With how full we are, it&#39;s going to be a huge task.&#34; Zoe&#39;s hand shook, smearing her lipstick. She snatched up a tissue, pretending to fix it while listening closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager replied, &#34;We don&#39;t have a choice. Orders are orders. We&#39;re supposed to find out who that woman was-the one who mistakenly entered the presidential suite that night. Surveillance footage is gone,so we&#39;ll have to go through digital records.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who would dare walk into Mr. Graham&#39;s room like that?&#34; the assistant muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager stood up with a clap. &#34;No more chatting.Let&#39;s get started. They want results in two day/s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two men walked off, one after the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe sat frozen, her face losing color. Panic spread through her body like ice water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy was investigating that night again. If he found out the truth-that she wasn&#39;t the woman who entered his suite-everything she had worked so hard for would fall apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gripping her lipstick until her knuckles turned white,Zoe whispered under her breath,&#34;No. I won&#39;t let them find out.&#34;</p>
