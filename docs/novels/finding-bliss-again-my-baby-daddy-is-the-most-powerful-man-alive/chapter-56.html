                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t say a word-he simply strode toward Kayla,each step exuding quiet power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His custom-tailored suit,paired wvith a crisp white shirt,made him look razor sharp. His chiseled features and striking gaze could unnerve anyone around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as their eyes met, Kayla&#39;s breath hitched. Her heart began to pound against her ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t understand it; she knew she feared him, yet she couldn&#39;t stop looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy moved with deliberate, commanding steps,his presence overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fists clenched, Kayla willed herself to take a deep breath,bracing herself for whatever he had to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of speaking to her, Jeremy simply walked past her. As his gaze landed on the sleek car parked by the driveway, he stopped in his tracks and asked flatly, &#34;Are we expecting a guest today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla turned her head and followed his gaze,noticing Zoe&#39;s car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when Zoe had just graduated college, Amaya and Damon had spent a fortune buying her this car. Zoe had flaunted it shamelessly, even when the Cooper family&#39;s fortunes had begun to dwindle.No matter how tight things got, Amaya and Damon would bend over backwards to grant Zoe&#39;s every wish, whereas Kayla never got a penny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy,lips pursed, clearly didn&#39;t recognize the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Mr. Graham!&#34; The butler shuffled forward and。bowed. &#34;I believe you&#39;ll be quite pleased to see the guest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy,however, gave no sign of interest. Without a word,he turned and strode into the villa, never once glancing back at Kayla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a long breath she hadn&#39;t realized she&#39;d been holding, and the tension in her shoulders eased a little. His presence was always so intimidating-keeping her distance felt like the safest option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obviously, Johnny was behind all this, but she couldn&#39;t help but wonder how Jeremy would react when he found out that his unexpected visitor was none other than Zoe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Liam stepped out from the villa. He spotted her still rooted in place, her expression unreadable.&#34;Why are you just standing there? I offered to pick you up, but you turned me down, and now that you&#39;re suddenly here, you don&#39;t want to go in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who said I&#39;m not going in?” Kayla shot him a sharp glare, chin tilted defiantly, before striding into the house with renewed confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam scampered after her, eager to make it up to her. &#34;Here, let me carry your things,&#34; he offered with a sycophantic grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t head straight to the dining room Instead, he veered off to his room, craving a hot shower and fresh change of clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment he pushed open the door, he felt his skin prickle-something felt off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has anyone been in my room today?&#34; he asked,glancing back at the servant who had just entered to prepare his bath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant hesitated for a second. &#34;Ms. Cooper was feeling unwell, sir. Your father said she could rest here for a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s brows arched. &#34;Ms. Cooper?&#34; He had just seen Kayla outside. How on earth could she have ended up in his bed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, he marched over and yanked the blanket back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe stirred beneath the blanket, her silhouette outlined by a slinky dress that clung to her curves in all the places meant to catch attention. With a drowsy yawn,she reached her arms out and stretched-slowly and deliberately-before opening her eyes and feigning surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zoe?&#34; Jeremy&#39;s voice dropped several hundred degrees, his grip on the blanket tightening. &#34;Jeremy, you&#39;re back!&#34; Zoe&#39;s face lit up like fireworks.Her makeup was flawless, carefully curated to make her look innocent yet alluring. She sat up in bed with a practiced grace, deliberately assuminng a seductive posture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only as Jeremy tossed the blanket aside did he notice his surroundings. Zoe&#39;s jacket was tossed on the nightstand, her purse half open, high heels abandoned on the floor. Lipstick smeared a pillow, and foundation stained the blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened. He was a man who lived for order,and he required that everything stay in its place. Now,however,his private sanctuary had been invaded by an intruder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Surprise, Jeremy. I brought you something. Your father mentioned you loved roasted chestnuts as a child, so I bought them for you. Want some?&#34; Zoe flashed him her pearly whites, completely oblivious to the rising tension in the room. She gave a little smile and gestured toward the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned forward ever so slightly, her strapless dress slipping just enough to showcase her generous cleavage. Every move was calculated to tantalize, so much so that even the servant had to turn away,blushing awkwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy suppressed his irritation and grabbed her wrist,pulling her off the bed. &#34;Get out,&#34; he ordered, his voice as cold as steel. Zoe blinked,her wide, mascara-framed eyes fluttering in confusion. &#34;What&#39;s wrong? You don&#39;t want me here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out,&#34; he repeated, hissing through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the crackling tension, the servant quickly stepped in to mediate. &#34;Ms. Cooper, perhaps it&#39;s best if you give Mr. Graham a moment of privacy. After all,he still needs to shower and change.&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even someone as thick-skinned as Zoe could téll that she was not welcome here. Lips pursed, she gave a reluctant nod. &#34;Alright, alright, I&#39;m going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She headed for the door, but every few steps, she would look back over her shoulder in the hopes that Jeremy would change his mind.However, the latter remained icily silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the door clicked shut behind her, Jeremy&#39;s expression darkened even further. He irritably tugged his tie loose, flung it onto the sofa, and strode to the floor-to-ceiling window. &#34;What is she doing here?&#34; he spat in disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant paused and chose her words carefully.&#34;Your father said he wished to meet the woman he believed to be your girlfriend, so he arranged for Ms.Cooper&#39;s visit. Liam and his wife helped coordinate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy let out a slow breath. So this was why Johnny had orchestrated his return for tonight&#39;s family dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So everyone decided to play a trick on me, huh?&#34;</p>
