                <p>Just then, a well-dressed woman, the wife of a prominent businessman, began frantically seaching the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere shifted as curious glances spread through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given the wealth gathered at tonight&#39;s gala, even a pair of earrings could be worth a small fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie, the host of the event, stepped forward calmly.&#34;Do you remember where you last saw them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman, flustered and clearly upset, gestured toward a lounge area. &#34;I went to the restroom and left my earrings on the sofa, thinking I&#39;d pick them up when I returned. But when I came back, they were gone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of murmurs passed through the guests. No one could believe someone would steaI at such an upscale event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those earrings cost me millions,&#34; the woman said bitterly. &#34;Whoever took them is a disgrace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla couldn&#39;t believe anyone would casually leave something so expensive unattended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Archie motioned for security to review the camera footage, a server leaned in and whispered something in his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie&#39;s gaze shifted, briefly landing on Kayla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, Jeremy watched the interaction intently, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt nudged him. &#34;Is it just me, or does it look like Kayla is about to get accused?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Moments later, the server pointed to Kayla and raised his voice. &#34;This woman was near the sofa earlier.Maybe she took them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s heart pounded. She hadn&#39;t expected to be dragged intothis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s brows drew together as he scanned the crowd, visibly unsettled. Archie held up a hand. &#34;Let&#39;s not make assumptions. We&#39;ll check the security footage first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the woman wasn&#39;t convinced. She turned to Kayla with narrowed eyes. &#34;Did you fake my earrings?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla held her ground.&#34;No,I didn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let us search you,&#34; the woman insisted. &#34;If you&#39;ve got nothing to hide, what&#39;s the problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla let out a short, disbelieving laugh. She knew how it would look-letting them search her was tantamount to admitting guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re innocent, a quick search shouldn&#39;t bother you,&#34; Tricia chimed in, her voice dripping with faux concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stepped forward, glaring at her. &#34;You want a show? Fine. Search away. I&#39;ve got nothing to hide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she unzipped her purse and upended its contents onto the nearest table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd leaned in, hungry for drama. Tricia was practically glowing with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt smirked at the spectacle. &#34;Think we&#39;ll find the earrings?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy shot him a cold loók. &#34;Enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla raised her voice, eyes scanning the crowd. &#34;Take a good look. Are the earrings here or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman rushed forward and began rifling through the pile like she was at a clearance sale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a tense moment, with every eye on her, the lady held up.a pair of earrings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was sharp with triumph.&#34;Look at these!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps echoed around the room. Tricia feigned shock,pressing a hand to her chest. &#34;Kayla, how do you explain this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla turned pale. She stared at the earrings in disbelief. She had never seen them before in her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind raced, trying to make sense of it. Then it clicked-she remembered the server she had bumped into earlier. Could he have slipped it into her bag?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could speak, the woman seized her arm. &#34;You&#39;re so young, yet already stealing? Who are you?How did you even get into this event?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla opened her mouth to explain, but the risingchorus of jeers drowned her out. The word &#34;thief&#34; rang through the room like a slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia sidled up to Liam, whispering with a grin,&#34;It&#39;s hard to defend her now. Looks like she&#39;s guilty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam said nothing, Instead, he stepped between Kayla and the accuser. &#34;How much are the earrings? I&#39;ll pay for them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla recoiled,furious. His gesture only made her look more guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need your help,&#34; she snapped, shoving him aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla, don&#39;t escalate this,&#34; Liam urged. &#34;These aren&#39;t people we can afford to cross. Let me pay, and it&#39;ll end here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her laugh was bitter and scornful. &#34;So just because they were in my bag, I&#39;m automatically guilty? Why are you so eager to throw me under the bus?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman sneered. &#34;Still denying it? Fine-I&#39;m calling the police!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia, still playing the part of the concerned onlooker, chimed in, &#34;Kayla, don&#39;t you realize how embarrassing this is for Liam? If word gets out that his wife&#39;s a thief, it&#39;ll ruin his reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s stomach churned at the hypocrisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie finally stepped in. &#34;I trust Kayla&#39;s character. There&#39;s likely been a misunderstanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia folded her arms. &#34;If that&#39;s true, then prove it. But until then, someone explain how that earrings got into her bag.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s eyes locked onto Tricia&#39;s with a steady, unblinking stare. She said nothing, but her silence carried weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room quieted, though the whispers continued like smoke around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, á deep, clear voice broke through the tension. &#34;I&#39;ve been sitting by the sofa all night. And I didn&#39;t see Kayla touch a thing.&#34;</p>
