                <p>Liam&#39;s remark barely fazed Kayla. She scoffed inwardly, wondering why he was so invested in Jeremy&#39;s marital status when even Jeremy himself didn&#39;t seem to care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged, her tone casual and breezy. &#34;I&#39;m not the right person to ask. Maybe someone else knows more than I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya stepped into the spotlight, wearing a calculated smile. &#34;Actually, I&#39;ve already done some digging. Zoe&#39;s well-liked among our friends. She&#39;s gentle, bright, and cultured-even if her family background isn&#39;t the most impressive. Still, she seems to get along with Jeremy just fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny&#39;s eyes lit up with approval. The thought that Jeremy might finally be settling down pleased him immensely-every eligible heiress he&#39;d introduced to his son had been rejected. Now, with Zoe in the picture, he finally saw hope for the Graham family&#39;s future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing an opportunity, Janiya turned to Johnny.&#34;Since you&#39;re so curious, why not take advantage of the moment? Kayla&#39;s related to Jeremy&#39;s girlfriend-she can help us all get acquainted. How about a dinner tomorrow night so everyone can meet?&#34; Kayla&#39;s gaze sharpened, instantly wary. Of course,Janiya wouldn&#39;t hesitate to use her as a pawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny nodded in agreement. &#34;Kayla, I&#39;ll leave the arrangements to you and Liam. Make sure to introduce me to Jeremy&#39;s girlfriend tomorrow evening. With my milestone birthday coming up, it would be wonderful to celebrate with Jeremy and his partner by my side.Maybe I&#39;ll finally have a grandchild to look forward to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stayed silent, Jeremy&#39;s stern, handsome face flashing across her mind. Wouldn&#39;t he be furious if they made the decision behind his back? Besides, she knew Zoe all too well. Pushing Jeremy into this marriage was practically tossing him into a pit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Kayla weighed her options, Liamn beamed and jumped in without hesitation. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Grandpa.Kayla and I will handle everything just as you asked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny looked satisfied, nodding in approval. &#34;Good.I&#39;m counting on you two. If you pull this off, both of you will have a chance to join Graham Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya and Liam exchanged gleeful glances, their smiles nearly splitting their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truth be told, Johnny hadn&#39;t come here for Kayla&#39;s sake at all; hitting Liam was just a convenient excuse.His real agenda was pushing forward Jeremy&#39;s marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he felt everything was set in motion, Johnny departed with an air of satisfaction. Kayla&#39;s patience snapped. The divorce had been swept under the rug, and now she&#39;d been forced into orchestrating a dinner she never wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fixed Janiya and Liam with a sharp,mocking smile.&#34;It&#39;s like watching the same play on repeat-mother and son scrambling for Johnny&#39;s approval, hoping to cash in on his favor. But with Jeremy in the picture,you two are dreaming if you think you&#39;ll ever get your hands on anything. Isn&#39;t this little charade just pathetic?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam, face twisted with pain, braced himself against the table as he tried to stand tall. &#34;Kayla, what the hell are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya tightened her grip on his arm, holding him back.&#34;Don&#39;t take the bait, Liam. She&#39;s just stirring up trouble.Besides, your grandpa made it clear-she&#39;s got no choice but to help, unless she wants her life to get a lot harder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s eyes glinted coldly, her voice ringing with quiet fury.&#34;Let&#39;s see how long you can ride Johnny&#39;s coattails. I can&#39;t wait for the day you both get exactly what you deserve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s anger surged, but the effort sent another stab of pain down his back, making him gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya steadied him, worry etched across her face.&#34;Your grandpa promised he wouldn&#39;t be rough, but look at you-you felt every bit of that blow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla couldn&#39;t stand another moment in that house. As soon as Johnny&#39;s convoy disappeared down the driveway, she made her escape without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometime after midnight, Tricia slowly regained consciousness. The first thing she felt was a sharp sting across her cheek-a slap that jolted her fully awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up in confusion and saw Janiya looming over her, cold and commanding, flanked by several maids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Graham, why did you hit me?&#34; Tricia stammered,cradling her burning cheek as tears brimmed in her eyes, on the verge of breaking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya&#39;s gaze was icy and unyielding. &#34;Tricia, maybe Liam&#39;s still fooled by your little games, but don&#39;t take me for a fool. You&#39;re only here to stir up trouble,trying to drag Kayla back and blow this marriage apart.I don&#39;t care what you do with my son, but if you dare mess with my interests, don&#39;t expect any mercy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic shot through Tricia. She tumbled off the bed and threw herself at Janiya&#39;s feet, clutching desperately at her leg. &#34;Please, Mrs. Graham, I just want to be with Liam. I truly love him. I&#39;ll do anything you say-just tell me what you want!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya pried Tricia&#39;s hands away, her expression twisted with disgust. &#34;Don&#39;t flatter yourself. I&#39;mn not fond of Kayla, but I have even less patience for a scheming woman like you. Get out of this house and don&#39;t show up in front of Liam for now!&#34;</p>
