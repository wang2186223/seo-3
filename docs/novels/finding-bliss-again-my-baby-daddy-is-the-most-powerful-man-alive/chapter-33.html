                <p>Jeremy turned, shooting Dewitt a frosty look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt responded with a sheepish chuckle, the mischief in his eyes hard to miss. &#34;What? Did I cross a line?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You&#39;re really going to pretend there&#39;s nothing between you and Kayla?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s voice dropped into a warning chill. &#34;Say another word-you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt stifled a laugh behind his hand, his shoulders shaking slightly. &#34;Fine, I&#39;ll drop it. But with Kayla now on</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie&#39;s team, and you two teaming up so often these days, I&#39;d say there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ll be running</p>
                
                
                
                <p>into her a lot more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy gave no reaction, not a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intrigued,Dewitt leaned closer. &#34;You seriously feel nothing for her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy silently traced the rim of his wine glass, then slipped off the ring from his finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second Dewitt saw it, he spun on his heel and bolted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all these years with Jeremy, he&#39;d come to recognize the warning signs. When Jeremy made that move,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>it mean he was about to strike. If he didn&#39;t make himself scarce fast, he&#39;d be neck-deep in trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy slid the ring back onto his finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin stepped in and spoke. &#34;Mr. Graham,Mr. Campbell just arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm.&#34; Jeremy&#39;s eyes flicked toward Kayla, who stood at Archie&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She appeared completely at ease, slipping into conversation with the surrounding business elites as if she&#39;d belonged in their circle all along-composed, confident, and utterly unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the entrance, Liam appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trailing behind was Tricia, his secretary, wearing a champagne-colored gown and painted with flawless makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s eyes scanned the room and landed on Jeremy, who was hard to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the reluctance, he had little choice-his position demanded he offer a greeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle Jeremy,&#34;he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy gave a cursory glance, his attention sliding briefly to Tricia. He asked flatly, &#34;Didn&#39;t bring your wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question hit like a slap. Liam stiffened. &#34;Kayla&#39;s tied up with work, so I came on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s expression didn&#39;t changed. If anything, his tone turned even colder. &#34;Whatever you do is your business, but don&#39;t drag the Graham name through the mud. You&#39;re married. Don&#39;t give anyone a reason to start talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam flushed with discomfort. &#34;Thanks for the warning, Uncle. I&#39;ll keep it in mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy turned, ready to walk away, but Liam held him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casting a quick glance around, Liam lowered his voice. &#34;Uncle Jeremy, since we&#39;re both here1I was hoping to ask a small favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s tone stayed level. &#34;What kind of favor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard Mr. Campbell is looking to work with domestic firms on a shopping mall venture.Perennia Group is pursuing a similar direction. Since you&#39;re close with him, maybe you could introduce us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Liam finished his sentence, even Edwin shot him a look of contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perennia Group-a modest firm at best-actually had the audacity to chase a partnership with the esteemed Campbell Group, a titan that stood toe-to-toe with North Investment?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam clearly didn&#39;t grasp the weight of his own limitations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s sharp face relaxed into a faint smirk, laced with ridicule. &#34;Perennia Group barely clawed its way out of a financial mess, and now you think you&#39;re ready to take on a Campbell Group development?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam didn&#39;t blink. &#34;Uncle Jeremy, people need to aim forward. Yes, Perennia had a rough patch, but that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;ve stopped growing. Don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s tone remained casual, yet every word hit with precision. &#34;A bit of advice-before chasing new deals, settle your debt with Newton Group and reclaim Cooper Group. It&#39;s still tied up as collateral, isn&#39;t it? If Mr. Campbell finds out your whole company&#39;s foundation is your wife&#39;s legacy, do you really think he&#39;ll entertain a partnership?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a single, cutting remark, Jeremy shattered any hope Liam had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A feeling of discomfort flared in Liam&#39;s chest. He was family, wásn&#39;t he? Why was Jeremy so unwilling to lend a hand?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He withdrew to the lounge area with Tricia following close behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What now, Mr. Graham?&#34; she asked, lowering her voice. &#34;We went through a lot just to get invited. We can&#39;t walk away with nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam snapped, frustrated, &#34;Be quiet. If I want something, I&#39;ll find a way to get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia gestured across the room. &#34;Mr. Campbell is over there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zane was approaching Kayla, his wife and child beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is Kayla here?&#34; Liam muttered in surprise, his thoughts flashing to that unique ring he&#39;d once seen on her finger-the one that had belonged to Zane. Kayla appeared to share a close rapport with Zane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia slid her arm through his, voice sweet. &#34;Why don&#39;t we go say hello together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay here. I&#39;ll go alone.&#34; He shrugged her off and walked toward Kayla alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia didn&#39;t want to accept it, but all she could do was stand by and watch him walk over to Kayla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla, it&#39;s been a while. You look amazing tonight.&#34; Zane and Kelley were just then arriving to greet Kayla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla crouched to ruffle the boy&#39;s hair, her voice gentle. &#34;Thank you. That&#39;s very kind of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here you are! I&#39;ve been searching everywhere for you.&#34; Liam appeared out of nowhere, slipping an arm around Kayla&#39;s waist and pulling her firmly against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Kayla stiffened, then tried to shove him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Liam only tightened his hold, determined not to let her slip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zane and Kelley exchanged a glance before turning to Kayla with amused curiosity.&#34;Kayla, may we ask who this gentleman is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam spoke with quiet confidence as he tucked a loose strand of Kayla&#39;s hair behind her ear.&#34;Hello,I&#39;m Liam Graham-Kayla&#39;s husband and the CEO of Perennia Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re her husband, then you&#39;re a friend of ours.&#34; The Campbells immediately warmed up to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stomped her heel down on his leather shoe, leaning in and whispering, &#34;Liam, what the hell are you doing?&#34;</p>
