                <p>Switching off her phone, Kayla gave her head a gentle shake. &#34;It&#39;s nothing important, Mr. Newton. All my tasks are finished, so I&#39;ll be leaving now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth filled Archie&#39;s voice as he stopped her. &#34;Hold on, Kayla. There&#39;s something I want to talk to you about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening up, she offered a respectful nod. &#34;Of course. What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Archie produced a check from his drawer and placed it in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick glance at the amount made Kayla pause, her eyes widening at the sight of five million written across it.Puzzlement colored her question. &#34;What&#39;s this about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret clouded Archie&#39;s face as he explained, &#34;I heard about the incident with Isaac last time. He&#39;s been my business associate for years, and I should have recognized his character sooner. This is for the trouble and fear you went through. As your employer, it&#39;s my duty to make amends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing the gesture, Kayla slid the check back across the desk. &#34;You don&#39;t have to do this. You aren&#39;t responsible for his actions. Honestly, I should be thanking you for employing me and paying me so well.There&#39;s no way I could accept such a large sum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined, Archie pushed the check toward her again. &#34;Kayla, I insist. If you refuse, I&#39;ll never forgive myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet smile appeared as Kayla stood. &#34;Really, that&#39;s not necessary. If you truly want to make things up to me, you could always speed up the process of transferring Cooper Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing her bag, she added, &#34;Just teasing. I&#39;ll be heading out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of Kayla leaving left Archie staring at the untouched check, a thoughtful glint sharpening his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His assistant approached with a hint of admiration. &#34;She turned down five million without a second thought. She&#39;s on the brink of divorcing Liamn and facing a rough future, but money means nothing to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp glance from Archie ended the conversation. &#34;Back to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Kayla exited the building and climbed into a waiting taxi. &#34;Perennia Group, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her arrival at Perennia Group was met with disappointing news from the secretary-Liam was out of the office for the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perched in the general manager&#39;s office, Kayla exuded an unmistakable chill, her flawless features set in an expression that brooked no nonsense. That frosty presence sent shivers through the new secretary, who hovered nearby and looked as though she&#39;d rather be anywhere else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her eyes at last, Kayla addressed the young woman. &#34;Do you happen to know where he&#39;s gone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nervous shake of the head was all the secretary could manage.′′MrIr. Graham didn&#39;t mention anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity flickered as Kayla took in the girl&#39;s fresh-faced beauty. Evidently, Liam hadn&#39;t wasted time-Tricia&#39;s exit had only opened the door for yet another attractive hire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a polite smile, Kayla rose and offered a reassuring nod. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. Just keep up with your work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gratefully, the secretary stepped aside, breathing easier as Kayla swept past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had the door closed than relief flooded the secretary&#39;s face. She pressed a hand to her chest and whispered, &#34;Nobody told me the boss&#39;s wife could freeze the air. She nearly scared the life out of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the taxi waited while Kayla placed a call, her lips curving into a cool, knowing smile.&#34;Tyrone, care to tell me where Liam&#39;s hiding today?&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Liam&#39;s assistant, Tyrone Smith was rarely in the dark about his boss&#39;s whereabouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure where Mr. Graham is. Maybe try reaching him yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft laugh escaped Kayla. Her tone remained calm, yet every word carried weight. &#34;I&#39;mn sure you remember that I helped your wife land her job. She&#39;s thriving now-just got a promotion, in fact. Imagine if l happened to share those old fund issues with her new boss. What do you think would become of her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic was immediate in Tyrone&#39;s voice. &#34;Please, Mrs. Graham, I&#39;m begging you. Have mercy.My family needs this.Don&#39;t ruin us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cold, dismissive snort, Kayla drove her point home.&#34;SO1,are you ready to be honest about where Liamis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyrone hemmed and hawed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spit it out. Where is he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic took hold of Tyrone, forcing the words out of him. &#34;Azure Oasis Grand Hotel! That&#39;s where he is!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hotel in the middle of the day-Kayla needed no further explanation. Clearly, Liam wasn&#39;t there for business or sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold, predatory smile tugged at her lips as she hung up. Slipping on her sunglasses, she addressed the driver with quiet command. &#34;Head to Azure Oasis Grand Hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hotel, a wave of sweet, perfumed air drifted out the moment Liam pushed open the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around, the room shimmered with celebration-heart-shaped rose petals adorned the bed, and intimate trinkets lay carefully arranged nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat surged through him as he took it all in, somnething inside him sparking to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the door, Liam scanned the space, but not a soul was in sight. He raised his voice and said, &#34;Tricia, quit playing games. You&#39;ve been hounding me with calls and texts just to drag me here. Now thatI&#39;ve come,where are you hiding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence answered him; the room gave nothing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a huff, he strode inside and slammed the door, determination in every step. &#34;Let&#39;s see what scheme you&#39;ve cooked up this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steam curled from the private hot spring at the far end, rose petals dotting the surface. A sleek, femininefigure lounged among the fragrant water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Draped in a black camisole, Tricia waited, her long hair tumbling down her back, her posture dripping with confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smug satisfaction played at her lips as the noise behind her caught her attention. She shifted deliberately,making sure he noticed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, Liam strode up to the pool, shadow falling over her as he glared down. &#34;Enough with the games,Tricia. I&#39;ve given you everything you asked for. I told you-leave me alone. Why keep pestering me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, Tricia lunged sideways, cupped her hand, and flung a splash of water into his face. Not missing a beat, she grabbed his wrist and yanked him into the water with her.</p>
