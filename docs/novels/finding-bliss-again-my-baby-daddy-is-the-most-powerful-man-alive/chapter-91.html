                <p>Kayla reached Jeremy&#39;s office with the medicine and knocked on the door, but no one answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She eased the door open and saw Jeremy seated at his desk, his posture weary and his features drawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head drooped, one hand pressed to his forehead,betraying just how sick he felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m coming in,&#34; Kayla announced and placed the medicine on his desk. &#34;Edna sent me over with this. If you&#39;re not feeling well,you ought to take it right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy gave no reply, his fatigue making him seem even more distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pile of paperwork lay untouched before him, and Kayla decided not to intrude any further. &#34;I&#39;ll get out of your hair now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only as she turned to go did Jeremy stir from his daze.His hand shot out, and before she knew it, he&#39;d caught her by the wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grasp didn&#39;t waver. In one swift movement,he drew her onto his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat flooded her cheeks as surprise sent her heart racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s gasp broke the stillness, her palm brushing against his burning skin. &#34;Jeremy, you&#39;ve got a fever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes fixed on her, Jeremy seemed unwilling to let her go. He turned away just slightly, murmuring, &#34;I&#39;m alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hand to his forehead left Kayla visibly worried.&#34;You&#39;re running a temperature, and you&#39;re still insisting you&#39;re fine? You never look after yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attempting torise, she found his arms circling her waist,keeping her close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in, resting his head against her shoulder,as if the contact soothed him. His voice was a low whisper. &#34;You did bring the medicine, didn&#39;t you? Let me have it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth flooded Kayla&#39;s cheeks as she pressed her hands against Jeremy&#39;s chest. &#34;Let me go or I can&#39;t get the medicine,&#34; she insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quiet sigh, Jeremy finally let his arms fall away,his reluctance obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasted no time in retreating, feeling her heartbeat racing wildly in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at him, she saw none of his usual composure;instead, he appeared frail, almost like a lost kitten searching for shelter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Touching her face to cool the blush, Kayla murmured under her breath, &#34;Don&#39;t read too much into a sick guy&#39;s actions.&#34; Without delay, Kayla poured some water, snapped open the medicine, and stretched out her hand with both ready for him. Jeremy just turned his head,frowning,his refusal clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla sighed, exasperated. &#34;You asked for the medicine, but now you&#39;re being difficult?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy winced, eyes squeezed shut. &#34;It tastes awful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re exaggerating! These are the easiest pills to swallow,&#34; she retorted, moving closer to coax the medicine past his lips. Jeremy stubbornly pressed his mouth closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take it whenever you feel like it.&#34; Defeated, Kayla set both the glass and the medicine on his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze followed her briefly, but he didn&#39;t protest or call her back. Leaning forward, he pressed his forehead to his hand, eyes closing as if even holding himself upright took effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she reached for the handle, Kayla paused,worry tugging at her. &#34;Leaving him like this would only cause problems,&#34; she murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resolving not to let things get worse, she hurried back,helped Jeremy sit straighter, and placed the pill in his mouth, following with a drink of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attempt didn&#39;t go smoothly. Jeremy coughed and spluttered, pushing her away while grabbing the desk for support. Heat crept up Kayla&#39;s neck as she froze in place.&#34;That was too much water-sorry about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment passed before Jeremy&#39;s gaze sharpened,some of the confusion lifting. His tone came out cool and measured. &#34;Take me to the lounge. I need to lie down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Kayla moved to his side, doing her best to support his weight as they shuffled out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The opulence of Jeremy&#39;s private lounge struck her.The chandelier scattered glimmering light over thick carpets, and every piece of furniture seemed tailored for comfort and wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla marveled inwardly. &#34;So this is how the wealthy live.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She carefully helped Jeremy navigate the plush floor until they reached a sprawling bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhaustion overtook Jeremy immediately. He collapsed into the mattress, tugged the blanket around his shoulders, and surrendered to fatigue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his breathing slowed and his eyes slid shut,Kayla began to slip quietly from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a wave of nausea swept over her. Hand clamped over her mouth, she rushed into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lounge filled with the harsh sounds of her dry heaving. Restlessness pulled Jeremy from his sleep. He blinked through the haze, catching sight of Kayla&#39;s silhouette bent over the sink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after the sickness passed did Kayla straighten,studying her own reflection in the bathroom mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning sickness, which she&#39;d thought had faded,had come surging back with no warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over her as she noticed Jeremy still appeared to be asleep, blissfully unaware of what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After shutting off the tap, Kayla drew in a steadying breath, her hand unconsciously coming to rest on her stomach as she made her way back into the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no reason to push yourself. If you&#39;re not well,just take the day to recover.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suddenness of Jeremy&#39;s words made Kayla&#39;s hand fly to the doorframe for support, her body spinning toward him, caught completely off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where he rested, Jeremy watched her intently his face still drained of color but his gaze unyielding and sharp.</p>
