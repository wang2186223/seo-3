                <p>Kayla waited at the roadside, the humid air finally giving way as a light breeze brushed past, cooling her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest still thudded with the lingering rush of emotions, her cheeks tinged pink as fragments of the earlier encounter replayed in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek black Maybach rolled to a stop beside her, its arrival subtle yet impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The window on the passenger side slid down with a quiet hum, and Edwin&#39;s face appeared. He regarded her with calm civility. &#34;Would you like a ride home? It&#39;s on the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the back seat, an icy stare seemed to cut straight through the barrier of glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s refined profile was barely visible in the reflection, yet it carried unmistakable weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla steadied her breath and gave a gentle response. &#34;Thank you, but my ride is already on the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin looked over his shoulder before giving her a courteous nod. &#34;Very well. Goodbye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car eased back into motion and disappeared down the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla pressed her palms to her warm cheeks and let out an exasperated whisper.&#34;It was just applying an ointment-no bid deal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, her ride pulled up. She stepped in without delay and left the scene behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the next few days, Kayla deliberately kept her distance from Jeremy, doing everything she could to sidestep another uncomfortable run-in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Liam clung to Marsha as his bargaining chip, refusing to divorce Kayla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In response, Kayla sought legal counsel, hoping the law could untangle the situation he insisted on prolonging. in the quiet atmosphere of a cafe, Khalid Potter flipped through the documents Kayla had brought.&#34;Taking this through legal means doesn&#39;t work in your favor right now. Since Cooper Group is still under mortgage,your claim to the groupis significantly weakened. There&#39;s a real chance you&#39;l walk away with nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of leaving empty-handed was unacceptable to Kayla. She couldn&#39;t let Liam take everything. At the very least, she had to win back what was hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Potter, if I manage to clear the mortgage on Cooper Group, will that make the divorce easier to negotiate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khalid gave a firm nod. &#34;Yes, that would shift things in your favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they&#39;d finished going over the details, the lawyer stood and left, leaving Kayla alone with her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she accepted Archie&#39;s conditions and joined Newton Group, there could be a path to recovering Cooper Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Kayla considered the possibilities, the cafe door opened. Two women stepped inside, dressed in bold colors and expensive accessories, their laughter trailing behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia scanned the room and spotted Kayla sitting by the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla·caught sight of them as well but didn&#39;t plan to acknowledge their presence. She paid her bill quietly and rose to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could take a step, Tricia&#39;s companion spoke with theatrical surprise. &#34;Well, if it isn&#39;t Mrs.Graham.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla turned and immediately recognized the woman-Felicia Bates, one of the staff at Perennia Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when Kayla still worked at Perennia Group, Felicia had just arrived as an intern. She had trailed after Kayla constantly, eager to impress, playing the part of a loyal sidekick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,Felicia appeared to have switched allegiances, clinging closely to Tricia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gave them a flat look, her expression cool and unbothered. THole wasted no fime adopting a friendly front. &#39;R&#39;s been a while. How have things been wlth you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s reply cut through the pretense. &#34;You really have to ask? With Liam dragging out this divorce, how do you think I&#39;m doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia tilted her head, her voioe thick with mock sympathy. &#34;But Liam&#39;s been good to you. Why fight so hard for a divorce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was enough for Kayla. &#34;Tricia, drop the act. You&#39;re the one counting the days tllf we spllf, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felicia chimed in,&#34;Why even talk to her? Mrs. Graham clearly has too much time on her hands, stirring up drama to get Mr. Graham&#39;s attention. Unlike you, she&#39;s just playing housewife with nothing better to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gave a dry, biting laugh. The same intern who once clung to her approval now dared to speak this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My personal life doesn&#39;t concern you,&#34; she said with a frosty smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved forward, closing the distance, until she stood level with them-taller than both, even without heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia and Felicia shrank back slightly, their earlier bravado cracking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t take offense, Mrs. Graham,&#34; Tricia said, wearing a sweet smile that didn&#39;t reach her eyes. &#34;Felicia was just teasing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, she casually swept her hair to the side, exposing a faint hickey on her collarbone, a not-so-subtle message about where she&#39;d spent the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia&#39;s shameless attempt at provocation struck Kayla as almost amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a scornful laugh. &#34;No need to show off. I&#39;m not interested in seconds. But if you are, hold on tight -he&#39;ll move on the moment someone else catches his eye.&#34;	,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia snapped back, &#34;I&#39;ll pass that along to Liam. And rest assured, he&#39;s in good hands. Let&#39;s be honest,without him, what do you have left? He&#39;s the reason your grandmother&#39;s still alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the words had time to settle, Kayla seized the coffee cup from the table and hurled its contents straight at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The splash Hit Tricia full on, coffee soaked her hair, streamed down her face, and ruined her designer outfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla set the empty cup onto the table with a sharp clink, brushed her hands together, and spoke with cold detachment. &#34;Next tlme, don&#39;t come alone. Bring Liam, I&#39;ve got somethning saved for him as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed past them without looking back and walked out of the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felicia scrambled to Tricia&#39;s side, her voice rising in concern. &#34;Tricia,are you hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia shakily brushed the coffee from her face, her expression twísted with rage.</p>
