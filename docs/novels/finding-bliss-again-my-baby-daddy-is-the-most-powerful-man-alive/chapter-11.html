                <p>Zoe hadn&#39;t been exaggerating-Jeremy getting hurt was no small matter, and once word got out, the entire Graham family would explode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when that happened, Kayla knew exactly where the blame would land. They already didn&#39;t think much of Liam. There was no chance they&#39;d go easy on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s nerves were fraying. The deal with North Investment was already hanging by a thread, and now she&#39;d managed to offend Jeremy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath and steadied her nerves. Then she made her way through the hospital corridors toward Jeremy&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin stepped in front of her, blocking the doorway the moment he spotted her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla craned her neck, trying to see inside, but the doorway gave away nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She faced Edwin and asked,&#34;How&#39;s Jeremy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still bleeding, thanks to you,&#34; Edwin spat, his tone dripping with frustration Kayla swallowed her pride. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; she said sincerely. &#34;Can I see him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t. Mr. Graham likely/doesn&#39;t want you anywhere near him,&#34; Edwin said coolly, planting himself firmly in front of the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let her in.&#34; A low voice cut through the tension</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s breath caught. That voice-so cool, so clear -sent a shiver down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin peeked inside, clearly displeased, but stepped aside. &#34;You heard him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The private room was still and spotless. Soft white curtains swayed gently with the breeze, adding a calm,almost delicate air to the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy sat at the edge of the bed, a tray of medical supplies laid out around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla had expected to see a nurse attending to him,but to her surprise, the room was quiet-he was completely alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His features were sharp and striking, almost too perfect to be real-he had the kind of face that was hard to look away from</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jeremy?&#34; Kayla spoke up gently. She stayed near the  door, hesitant to step any closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy looked up, his dark eyes steady and unreadable. &#34;Did you come to apologize?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did,&#34; Her voice was soft. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I never meant to hurt you. I can pay for your medical expenses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she said it, Kayla scolded herseIf silently What was she even thinking? He was the head of a multinational company and would never be concerned with something as insignificant as hospital fees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need your money,&#34; he said flatly, brushing off her offer without a second thought</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla shifted her weight. &#34;Will your family find out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not a kid. I don&#39;t report everything to them,&#34;he muttered, a hint of irritation in his voice as he shot her a quick glance</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, suddenly out of things to say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence that followed was sharp-edged</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy dropped his gaze and began wrapping a bandage around his arm, but his fingers moved stffly,the process clearly not going well</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cut from the shattered beer bottle was deeper than she&#39;d thought. Kayla watched in silence for a moment, then, unable to ignore it any longer, offered, &#34;Do you want some help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, lifted his gaze, and studied her for a beat.Then he gave a faint nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla moved in quietly, taking the bandage from his hand. Carefully, she wrapped the gauze around his arm,trying not to press too hard.&#34;Why didn&#39;t you call for a nurse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t like strangers getting too close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands paused. Just for a second</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strangers? Did that mean he didn&#39;t see her that way?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy caught the brief flicker of uncertainty in her eyes and seemed to read her thoughts without needing to ask. &#34;You&#39;re part of the Graham family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief slipped through her in a soft sigh. She tied the bandage into a tidy knot, then stood up, ready to step back. But as she moved, her lips brushed lightly against the bridge of his nose. The touch was accidental,fleeting, but it jolted the air between them</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes locked. Neither of them spoke</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s heart thudded hard against her ribs, a wild fear  creeping in as she half-wondered if he might lash out at her in the next second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had a memory surfaced?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liam,why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin&#39;s voice cut through the silence from just outside the room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla pulled away quickly, letting go of Jeremy&#39;s arm and stepping back</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy looked away as well and quietly reached for his suit jacket</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam walked in, his face tight with concern. His eyes moved quickly to Jeremy, who still looked as distant and composed as ever, and he asked with quiet respect, &#34;Uncle Jeremy, I heard Kayla accidentally injured you. Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, Liam&#39;s eyes flicked over to Kayla. She turned her head slightly, her face calm-almost detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not a big deal,&#34; Jeremy said flatly. &#34;Kayla just got caught up in some messy family drama. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam nodded, clearly uncomfortable. &#34;Kayla&#39;s relationship with her stepmother and sister isn&#39;t great  I&#39;m sorry for the trouble. Please don&#39;t hold it against her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smirk pulled at the corner of Jeremy&#39;s mouth,though it didn&#39;t reach his eyes. &#34;She did come here and apologize sincerely. That&#39;s more than enough.I won&#39;t make a big deal out of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Glad to hear that. Uncle Jeremy,I&#39;ll take Kayla home now.&#34; Liam said,reached for her hand, and pulled her along before she could say anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the door closed behind them, Edwin entered the room. &#34;Mr. Graham, do you think Kayla came here today on purpose? She might be hoping you&#39;ll support Liam&#39;s company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy looked down at the fresh bandage on his arm,his expression tightening as his dark eyes narrowed.&#34;Find out everything you can about Kayla.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin hesitated. &#34;Are you trying to stand up for Zoe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp look Jeremy shot him was enough to make Edwin drop his head. &#34;Sorry. I crossed the line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy slipped a hand into his pocket and pulled out a brooch. He held it up, studying every detail with quiet focus. &#34;And double-check whether the woman from that night was truly Zoe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Mr.Graham.&#34; Once Edwin left, Jeremy remained seated, still staring at the brooch. His thoughts drifted back to that night</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though the room had been dimly lit, he could still picture her eyes-filled with fear and a kind of fragile vulnerability</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body had been warm and delicate, her breathing light and uneven, making it nearly impossible for him to pull away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the first woman he had ever been with</p>
