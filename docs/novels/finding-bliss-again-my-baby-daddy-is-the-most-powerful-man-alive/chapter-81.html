                <p>Kayla returned to Newton Group to deliver her report,and Archie couldn&#39;t hide his admiration for how swiftly she had handled the task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated behind his desk, he flipped through the project contracts she submitted, each one signed by Jeremy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a satisfied nod, he said, &#34;Kayla, I knew I made the right call. These deals have always been tough to lock in,yet you pulled it off like it was nothing. At this rate,I&#39;ll need to give you a bigger role. Otherwise, we&#39;re wasting your potential.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla offered a humble smile. &#34;That&#39;s kind of you, Mr.Newton. I&#39;m just doing my part.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie let out a small laugh. &#34;We&#39;re holding a celebratory dinner tonight with the project heads.You&#39;re on the guest list, of course. Also, expect a salary bump this month, along with everything else l promised.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla suddenly recalled that Marsha was switching rooms tonight, and she had planned to help. Her expression tightened, atrace of concern flickering across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie caught the shift in her demeanor. &#34;Something the matter? You already made plans for tonight? You&#39;re the reason we&#39;re celebrating, and this dinner is meant to honor that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given his insistence, Kayla could only agree. &#34;Okay.I&#39;ll be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she left the CEO&#39;s office, she pulled out her phone and stepped aside to make a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver picked up. &#34;Kayla, is there something you need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have work tonight, so I won&#39;t be able to stay with Grandma. Please keep a close eye on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver&#39;s voice was calm. &#34;Don&#39;t worry.Your husband already arranged for someone to help with the move. Since you&#39;ve got your hands full, there&#39;s no need to come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Liam&#39;s name made Kayla tense. If she hadn&#39;t been swamped with work, he wouldn&#39;t have had a chance to meddle at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dinner was attended by Archie and several seasoned project leaders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just outside the private dining room, Kayla paused when she saw a waiter wheeling in a cart loaded with bottles of red wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie spotted her and called out, &#34;Kayla, step inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she stepped inside, several executives looked up,momentarily taken aback by her striking appearance.Isaac Brewer,one of the senior figures, smiled with a subtle squint and remarked to Archie, &#34;I was starting to wonder how you&#39;ve been closing so many deals lately.Now I see it&#39;s all thanks to this impressive young woman. You&#39;re sitting on a goldmine of talent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla returned a soft smile and took a seat beside Archie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chuckling,Archie replied, &#34;Kayla&#39;s been a real asset.We&#39;re fortunate she chose to work with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then hè leaned slightly toward her and murmured,&#34;These folks have been with me a long time. No need to stay too long; just make an appearance, then you can head out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla nodded lightly. &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Jorge Quinn lifted his glass and stood up. &#34;Kayla, I&#39;ve heard quite a bit about your accomplishments. Let me toast to your success.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla poured herself a glass of juice, stood up, and responded warmly, &#34;I&#39;ll toast with this instead. Mr.Quinn, I look forward to learning from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac cut in, &#34;Jorge is making a toast and you&#39;re drinking juice? Come on, everyone here has wine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the moment grew tense, Archie rose with his own glass and laughed. &#34;I&#39;ll take the wine for her.Hope that&#39;s alright with everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jorge and lsaac shared a qlance but couldn&#39;t refuse Archie&#39;s gesture. They raised their glasses, clinked them together, and drank as one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Partway through the evening, Archie&#39;s phone rang. He excused himself and stepped out to take the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left at the table, Kayla remained quiet. The conversation didn&#39;t interest her, so she checked her phone,scrolling through unread messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac soon approached, wineglass in hand, and took the seat beside her. &#34;I&#39;ve heard your name more than once. Archie holds you in high regard, and now that I&#39;ve met you in person, I can see why.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla slipped her phone into her bag and returned a polite smile. &#34;You flatter me, Mr. Brewer. I&#39;m just doing my job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression sharpened with amusement as he rested an arm along the back of her chair and leaned in, legs casually crossed. The space between them grew noticeably smaller.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brushed her hand under the pretense of adjusting his glass,his tone suggestive. &#34;Drinking juice all night,that&#39;s no fun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s instincts kicked in. Her expression cooled as she pulled her hand away and discreetly wiped it on her skirt. Without a word, she reached for the wine bottle and filled a glass. &#34;Mr. Brewer, since we&#39;ve run into each other tonight,allow me to offer you a toast.&#34;</p>
