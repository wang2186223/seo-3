                <p>In his villa, Jeremy, in a fitted black pajama set, made his way down the winding staircase, each step more confident than the last-proof that his strength had returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the living room, Dewitt sprawled out on the sofa, absentmindedly turning a cup in his hands. &#34;You really can&#39;t stay away from work, can you? You drag Edwin and me over here to talk business when you&#39;re just getting over an illness. Honestly, Jeremy, you&#39;ve got enough money. Take a vacation for once!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy shot Dewitt a disdainful look.&#34;You sound like a nagging grandmother. Next thing, you&#39;ll be signing up for knitting lessons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of letting it go, Dewitt rolled his eyes, grabbed the nearest pillow, and lobbed it at him.&#34;What a cheap shot. I&#39;m rethinking our friendship, Jeremy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the pillow with one hand, Jeremy tossed it right back, only for Dewitt to dodge with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Edwin entered the room, settling a jacket over Jeremy&#39;s shoulders.&#34;How are you holding up, Mr. Graham?&#34; he asked, his concern clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight shrug, Jeremy replied, &#34;A good night&#39;s sleep did the trick. Fever&#39;s gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief flickered across Edwin&#39;s face. &#34;Glad to hear it. There&#39;s something I should update you about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy took a seat beside Dewitt, poured himself some water, and sipped it with deliberate calm. &#34;Let&#39;s hear it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liam left empty-handed last time. I arranged for someone to monitor him, and he&#39;s been hustling for funds.Just recently, he sold a cemetery owned by Perennia Group to a real estate company-they&#39;re planning to turn it into a pig farm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news sent Dewitt into a fit of laughter. He straightened up and shook his head. &#34;Has Liam completely lost it? Desperate enough to sell graveyards now? Wait until the curses start coming for him!&#34; Jeremy&#39;s features tightened with interest. He glanced at Edwin. &#34;If memory serves, that land belonged to Cooper Group,right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin nodded. &#34;Exactly. That cemetery sits on premium real estate. Kayla&#39;s mother refused to let it go while she was alive, and after she passed, she was laid to rest there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mischief danced across Dewitt&#39;s face as he clapped, delighted by the drama.&#34;With Kayla&#39;sfiery streak,she&#39;ll make a scene when she catches wind of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle flicker of intent sparked in Jeremy&#39;s eyes as he shot Edwin a significant look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reading the signal instantly, Edwin responded, &#34;I caught wind of Liam&#39;s negotiations early. The papers aren&#39;t finalized yet, and Kayla doesn&#39;t know a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s fingers traced idle patterns along his cup, his nod barely noticeable. &#34;Fill her in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; Edwin bowed his head and left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Jeremy could enjoy a moment of quiet, Dewitt swung an arm around his shoulder, his features settling into a sly grin. &#34;You&#39;re not obligated to bring Kayla into this, but here you are, making sure she&#39;s in the loop. What&#39;sreally going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy slid out from Dewitt&#39;s hold, arching a brow. &#34;What are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a knowing smirk, Dewitt pressed on. &#34;Edwin let slip that you and Kayla have been spending extra time together.So,come clean-do you have feelings for her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t respond. Instead, he poured himself a cup of coffee and took a sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt, undeterred, leaned back with a broader grin, his tone both teasing and direct. &#34;You know your own heart. If you like her, go help her get rid of Liam-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words cut short as Jeremy interjected,&#34;That&#39;s not it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt&#39;s playful mask slipped for a beat, replaced by uncharacteristic gravity.11|SZoe the reason? Are you hesitating because of her?&#34; Cool and unwavering, Jeremy answered, &#34;I&#39;ll marry Zoe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt didn&#39;t hold back his opinion. &#34;Still, I think Kayla suits you better. Sometimes you have to trust your instincts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy patted Dewitt&#39;s shoulder and stood up. &#34;How about a round on the court?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging himself to his feet with a dramatic sigh, Dewitt replied, &#34;Whenever things get serious,you find a way to wriggle out of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Kayla passed a precisely arranged stack of paperwork to Archie, waiting at his desk for him to look it over. In the midst of the quiet, her phone buzzed unexpectedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new message flashed across the screen, this one from an unfamiliar number, warning her that Liam was planning to sell her mother&#39;s burial ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared hard at the screen, reading the words again and again, wondering who could have sent.such news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger burned in her chest as she clenched her phone. How could Liam stoop to that? That man had no shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up on the shift in her mood, Archie set the documents aside, his tone gentle with concern. &#34;Kayla, is everything alright? Did something just happen?&#34;</p>
