                <p>&#34;Whoever loses has to cough up two sports cars worth ten million each,&#34; Dewitt said with a cocky grin.&#34;Poor Jeremy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s eyes widened, stunned.&#34;Ten million?&#34; she blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie chuckled. &#34;We always play high stakes. Since he&#39;s decided to given up, it means he loses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy sat silently, lounging in a chair, sipping his coffee like the whole thing was beneath him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stood nearby, her thoughts swirling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two cars meant twenty million dollas. For someone like Jeremy, that was probably pocket change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had that kind of cash, she could&#39;ve already reclaimed Cooper Group, whisked Martha away, and set up her future kid&#39;s life without blinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know how to play golf?&#34; Jeremy asked suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla glanced around, realizing he was talking to her.′′Alittlle1′′she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give it a try,&#34; he said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gave a nervous laugh. &#34;I can play, sure, but wasting time on stuff like this isn&#39;t really my thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One million,&#34; Jeremy said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood to lose twenty million, and he was offering her just one?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rich people could be so stingy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her pout, Jeremy added coolly, &#34;Five million. Don&#39;t push your luck.&#34; &#34;Deal!&#34; Kayla agreed without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five million wasn&#39;t chump change. She&#39;d be out of her mind to turn it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With everyone watching, Kayla stepped onto the course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe, watching her, scoffed quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she couldn&#39;t play, there was no way Kayla could. Kayla was about to make a fool of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla picked up the club and nailed her first shot with precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her swing was smooth, practiced-not the swing of a novice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she moved, her slender frame cut a graceful silhouette against the green.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the sunlight, her skin glowed, and her striking features held every eye on the field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men were floored. She wasn&#39;t just beautiful-she could play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s actually good!&#34; Zoe gasped,jealousy flaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla remained cool and composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother had been a powerhouse in business-and on the golf course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing up, Kayla had tagged along, soaking up the game naturally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe noticed Jeremy watching Kayla, and it grated on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her fists so hard, a manicured nail snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t see that coming. She&#39;s legit,&#34; Dewitt said, clearly impressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie nodded. &#34;Even if both of us went up against her, we&#39;d still lose. She&#39;s a ringer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt chuckled. &#34;Jeremy, you hit the jackpot. Having Kayla on your side? Total win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s coffee sat cold and forgotten, his gaze locked on Kayla. She hadn&#39;t just been downplaying her skills-she&#39;d been sandbagging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The match ended perfectly, and Kayla strolled back,relaxed and confident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt and Archie clapped in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow,Kayla, you&#39;re full of surprises. Color me impressed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re too kind,&#34; Kayla replied with a smile, then turned to Jeremy. &#34;That five million you promised... Don&#39;t forget.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy nodded coolly.&#34;Edwin will transfer it to you tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla beamed. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five million for swinging a golf club? This day was a jackpot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to regain the spotlight, Zoe had a tray of drinks brought over. &#34;I brewed some coffee, folks. Take a break and enjoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, thanks,&#34; Dewitt said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla frowned at the cup handed to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pregnant, she knew caffeine was off-limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After passing out the drinks, Zoe noticed Kayla hadn&#39;t taken a sip. &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Not a fan of my coffee?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla raised a brow. &#34;Not at all. I just prefer mine sweet. Mind grabbing some sugar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Such a diva,&#34; Zoe muttered as she turned to fetch it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when Kayla noticed-Jeremy wasn&#39;t drinking coffee.His cup held juice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe was playing favorites, and she was not even subtleabout it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sidled up to Jeremy and whispered,&#34;Can we swap drinks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy eyed her coffee cup suspiciously. &#34;What, did you spike it?&#34; Kayla laughed, awkward but genuine. &#34;No, nothing like that. I&#39;m just not in the mood for coffee today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy handed over his juice with a casual wave. &#34;Here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Zoe returned with sugar, Kayla&#39;s cup was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you wanted sugar?&#34; Zoe asked, irritation leaking through her smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla blinked innocently. &#34;You took so long, I just drank it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe felt played, but quickly brushed it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Kayla&#39;s empty cup, she smirked toherself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as she drank it, that was what counted.</p>
