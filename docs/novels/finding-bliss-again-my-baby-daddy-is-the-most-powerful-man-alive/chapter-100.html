            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>On the fourth floor of Treasure Mall, Zoe basked in the spotlight as salesgirls in the luxury jewelry boutique circled her, their voices honeyed with praise. &#34;Miss, this set looks incredible on you-like you walked straight out of a palace. No one else could pull it off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soaking up every word, Zoe gazed at her reflection, the diamond necklace glinting beneath the showroom lights.&#34;You think so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely. You could be a cover model for any high-end magazine. This collection was made for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Zoe felt weightless, buoyed by admiration and the soft sparkle draped around her neck.Glancing down, she caught the price tag-one million, neatly printed. Once, that kind of money would&#39;ve sent her running for the door. But those days were over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flourish, she produced a gold card and laid it on the counter,the gesture catching the light-and every salesgirl&#39;s wide-eyed attention. In Trark, only the elite carried a card like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her chin, Zoe declared, &#34;I&#39;ll take it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Payment handled, she strode from the store, heels clicking with confidence, her spirits soaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for shopping with us, Ms. Cooper! We hope to see you again soon!&#34; The salesgirls bowed in perfect sync, voices sweet and professional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Zoe approached the elevator, a woman in a baseball cap and mask barreled past, ramming her shoulder hard enough to make Zoe wobble dangerously on her stilettos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She almost caught herself against a marble pillar, fury flashing in her eyes. &#34;Hey! Watch it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman slowed, yanking her mask down just enough to reveal a familiar, sour expression-Tricia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s lip curled as she spotted Tricia. &#34;Well, well. Liam&#39;s mistress. You must be lost-places like this are out of your league.&#34; Tricia&#39;s brow twitched, but she kept her tone steady. &#34;I need a word with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I&#39;ve got time for trash talk? Keep dreaming.&#34; Zoe turned on her heel, ready to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Suppose I told you Kayla&#39;s after Jeremy-would that get your attention?&#34; Tricia asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe spun around, her eyes flashing with fury. &#34;Don&#39;t make up stories! That bitch wouldn&#39;t dare!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, taunting smile spread across Tricia&#39;s lips. &#34;You really think Jeremy cares about you? To himn,you&#39;re just another pretty thing he can throw money at. Meanwhile, Newton Group&#39;s been playing nice with North Investment. Archie keeps pushing Kayla to handle the deals-just her and Jeremy, getting cozier every time.How long before she climbs right into his bed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage snapped in Zoe&#39;s voice. &#34;She&#39;s not even close to being good enough for him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia shrugged, feigning indifference. &#34;Don&#39;t take my word for it-look into it yourself. I hate Kayla just as much as you do. Why not team up? Get her out of the picture for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe didn&#39;t answer. She stared at Tricia in silence, her expression hard to read, then turned sharply and marched away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia&#39;s smirk lingered as she watched Zoe retreat, convinced she&#39;d planted the seed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the sanatorium, Kayla waited in the hallway while Marsha went through physical therapy,nurses bustling around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched Marsha&#39;s radiant smile and felt a tangle of emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still had a month left before the divorce from Liam would be finalized, and the looming deadline set her nerves on edge. She couldn&#39;t afford any missteps now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the divorce was done, she could finally take Marsha and leave Trark behind for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out her phone, Kayla quickly dialed Archie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered after several rings, sounding as busy as ever. &#34;Kayla? Isn&#39;t today your day off? What&#39;s going on?&#34;Lowering her voice, Kayla replied, &#34;Mr. Newton, our one-month agreement is almost over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie let out a short laugh. &#34;Relax, Kayla. I&#39;Il return Cooper Group to you, just ike I promised. My assistant&#39;s already preparing the paperwork. Still, I&#39;ve got to ask-are you sure you don&#39;t want to stay? The pay&#39;s pretty tempting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla answered, &#34;No, thank you. We agreed on one month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fair enough. I respect that,&#34; Archie responded, ending the call without protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Kayla slipped her phone away and turned to rejoin Marsha, her screen lit up with a new message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was from Jeremy&#39;s assistant, reminding her that tomorrow she&#39;d need to deliver the project files to Jeremy.Since he wvas out of town for the next couple of days, she&#39;d have to meet him at a different location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s brow knit as she glanced at the address on her phone, unease flickering across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started tapping out a message to Jeremy&#39;s assistant, determined to postpone the meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla, come here for a second!&#34; Marsha&#39;s voice rang out from down the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding her phone into her pocket, Kayla hurried over with a quick. &#34;Coming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, once she settled into her office, the memory hit-she&#39;d completely forgotten to follow up with Jeremy&#39;s assistant after her evening with Marsha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her meeting was scheduled at a resort more than sixty miles outside the city, practically demanding an overnight stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla sat at her desk, deep in thought, barely noticing as her coworker Lily Lyons wandered over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily knocked her knuckles lightly on Kayla&#39;s desk and called out, &#34;You seem miles away, Kayla. What&#39;s caught your mind? Mr. Newton says our team crushed it on the last round of projects, so he&#39;s buying everyone afternoon coffee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offering a faint smile, Kayla responded, &#34;I don&#39;t think l&#39;Il be able to join you guys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily looked ather, eyebrows raised.&#34;Why not?&#34;	  Scooping up a hefty stack of documents, Kayla let out a sigh.&#34;I&#39;ve got a business trip later. Total headache.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily&#39;s eyes danced with curiosity as she eyed the paperwork. &#34;Wait, is this for the North Investment deal?Rumor has it you&#39;re almost ready to close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla caught the spark in Lily&#39;s eyes and a new idea took shape. Grasping Lily&#39;s hand, she leaned in and whispered, &#34;Lily, I&#39;m feeling a bit off today. What do you say you handle this trip for me?&#34;</p>
