                <p>It took some time before Kayla noticed the taxi was straying farther and farther from familiar streets, the scenery growing more desolate by the minute. She shot a worried look at the driver and asked,&#34;This isn&#39;t the way home. Did you get lost?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver gave no reply, eyes locked on the road as his foot pressed down, picking up speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill crept up Kayla&#39;s spine. Sensing danger, she slapped her palm against the back of the seat and shouted, &#34;Pull over! Let me out, right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring her protests, the driver slammed the pedal down and veered onto a rugged, uneven path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thrown side to side by the rough ride, Kayla fumbled desperately for her phone, intent on calling for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before her fingers could dial a single number, the car screeched to a halt. The back door flew open, and two strangers yanked her from the seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hood slipped over her head, plunging everything into darkness. &#34;Who are you? Let me go!&#34; she screamed,voice raw with terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cries were ignored as the men stuffed her into a different vehicle and sped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bound and helpless in the back seat, Kayla struggled and screamed, but her efforts were swallowed by silence. Eventually, the car ground to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was dragged out, half-carried, and brought to the entrance of a rundown motel. They paused outside a battered door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move!&#34; one of them shouted, untying her just long enough to shove her roughly inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stumbled, barely catching herself against the peeling wallpaper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the next instant, the hood was yanked away,and harsh light stabbed her eyes. She squinted, shielding her eyes from the glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slimy voice slithered out of the shadows. &#34;Well,well, look who it is. Missed me,sweetheart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Revulsion twisted Kayla&#39;s stomach as she turned and spotted Isaac. His bloated frame and leering,greasy face made her skin crawl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of nausea rolled over her, forcing her to steady herself against the wall as she fought to keep from retching</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her in that state only seemed to darken Isaac&#39;s mood. He grabbed her roughly by the collar, his words seething with anger. &#34;You bitch! How dare you get me drunk tonight? You&#39;ll pay for this, I promise!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reacting fast, Kayla slammed her heel onto his foot and jerked away. &#34;Back off! Don&#39;t you dare lay a finger on me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A twisted glint shone in Isaac&#39;s eyes as he sized her up,openly leering at her face and the lines of her figure.He licked his lips and took another step forward.&#34;Here&#39;s the deal. If you satisfy me tonight, maybe I&#39;ll let the past slide. What do you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla continued to retreat, inching behind the couch as a barrier. She spat her contempt at him. &#34;If you&#39;re so desperate, why not buy yourself a prostitute? You act like a respected CEO, but you&#39;re nothing but filth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her insults only seemed to fuel lsaac&#39;s sick excitement. &#34;Say what you like now. Soon you&#39;lI be begging me to stop. We&#39;ll see how defiant you are then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wiped his mouth, eyes locked on her as he moved closer. Kayla snatched up a sofa cushion and flung it in his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Isaac lunged,she raced for the window, throwing it wide open. The night wind tore through the room,tossing loose papers into the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning halfway out, Kayla fixed him with a steely glare. &#34;One more step and I&#39;ll jump. Don&#39;t test me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac let out a mocking laugh. &#34;Go ahead. It&#39;s your choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s voice turned cold. &#34;You sure about that? The room&#39;s in your name. The police will find out everything. Imagine the scandal-&#39;Brewer Group CEO Drives Woman to Suicide.&#39; How do you think that&#39;ll play in the news?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression faltered, panic flickering across his features. Narrowing his gaze, he trieda new tactic.&#34;Come over here. Spend the night, and I&#39;ll make you rich-more than a hundred times what Newton Group pays you. You could live like royalty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp laugh escaped Kayla. &#34;Keep your money. Not everything&#39;s for sale. If you know what&#39;s good for you,you&#39;ll let me walk out of here now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s temper snapped. He whipped out his phone,barking orders for his men to come in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her chance, Kayla bolted for the exit. The fool hadn&#39;t bothered to lock the door, and she slipped out without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s furious voice echoed behind her. &#34;Don&#39;t let her get away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sprinting down the corridor, Kayla made it to the elevator-only to find herself face-to-face with Isaac&#39;s men. For a split second, everyone froze,uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recovering quickly, Kayla pointed frantically down the hall. &#34;Isaac&#39;s about to jump out the window! Hurry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men&#39;s heads whipped in the direction she&#39;d indicated.Before they could process her words, she was already gone. Realizing they&#39;d been duped, the head of the group snapped, &#34;She&#39;s got to be close! Find her, now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla darted past the stairwell, heart pounding. Out of nowhere, a hand shot out and seized her, yanking her into the dark.</p>
