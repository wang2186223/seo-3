                <p>Kayla perked up her ears, listening carefully, her thoughts spinning with the thrill of overheard drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t exactly common for women to show up looking for Jeremy at such a late hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And from the sound of it, there weren&#39;t just one but two voices, now drifting in from the balcony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy had taken Kayla to hide behind the balcony door. When he looked down, the faint light caught her face,alive with curiosity and quiet excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let go of her and raised a hand, signaling for silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gave a slight nod, barely breathing as she complied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two women next door, failing to locate him, finally decided to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla steadied herself, pressing down the flutter in her chest before whispering,&#34;Who were those women?Why were you hiding from them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy strolled over to the sofa and dropped into it. &#34;They were sent over by Dewitt. I came here to stay out of their way for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s question came out too fast. &#34;Sent over for what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy threw her a look, sharp, unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did she think this was, a late-night board game?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face tightened as she caught herself. &#34;That was rude of me,&#34; she murmured, voice low with regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped aside, putting space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she moved, Jeremy&#39;s eyes followed the curve of her waist and the length of her legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That moment earlier, when their bodies had brushed, had sent a heat through him he hadn&#39;t expected. And something about her tugged at him-maybe it was the shared bloodline with Zoe, the resemblance lurking just beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy studied her for a beat before asking, &#34;You and Zoe share the same father, right? You probably know her pretty well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s voice was flat. &#34;I moved out years ago. We&#39;re not that close. If you&#39;re trying to get information about her, I&#39;m not the one to ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you aware of what&#39;sgoing on between Zoe and me?&#34; Jeremy asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla hesitated, a vivid flash of that unforgettable night playing across her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, she lifted her head. &#34;No, not really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; With no answers to draw from her, Jeremy said nothing further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attention shifted to the paper bag sitting on the table, the medicine Edwin had brought earlier. Judging by its untouched state, Kayla hadn&#39;t taken any of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned inwardly. Edwin had gone out of his way, and for what? She clearly didn&#39;t need it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Kayla&#39;s face twisted, and she clamped a hand over her mouth to hold back a sudden wave of nausea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The movement caught Jeremy&#39;s eye, and he watched her closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla fought through the queasiness and quickly motioned to the door. &#34;I need to lie down. You should go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s jaw tensed, irritation flickering across his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being turned away wasn&#39;t something he was used to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an icy expression, he turned on his heel and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the door, he paused, lifting his arm for a quick sniff. Nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d just showered and changed,so why had she looked so sick? The moment the door shut behind him, Kayla rushed into the bathroom and bent over the sink. Though nothing came up, her stomach knotted painfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a tender hand resting on her belly, she muttered, &#34;Sweetheart, next time you see your father, try not to get too excited. If he ever finds out about you, we&#39;re in serious trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Kayla rose early, her hunger nudging her out the door in search of food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hotel&#39;s restaurant was quiet, with only a few guests scattered at different tables.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ordered pancakes and a bowl of creamy mushroom soup, then settled in at a small table. Just as she lifted her spoon, Jeremy and Dewitt appeared, striding in together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt headed straight for her and slid into the seat across from hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are the odds? We keep bumping into each other. Heard you spent the night in Jeremy&#39;s suite. Sleep well?&#34; His tone was playful, his expression even more so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Kayla glanced toward Jeremy before answering, &#34;I only stayed for the night. I&#39;m grateful to him for letting me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt gave a thoughtful nod, his grin widening. &#34;So that&#39;s why he turned down the company I arranged.Had a beauty waiting for him already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla coughed suddenly, soup catching in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy stepped in at that moment, delivering a swift kick to Dewitt&#39;s leg as a warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of joining her, Jeremy picked a table a short distance away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wincing,Dewitt reached down to rub his leg before rising from his seat. &#34;Just having a little fun. Don&#39;t take it to heart. Jeremy, come on-we&#39;re all friends here. No need to keep your distance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally walked off to join Jeremy, and Kayla exhaled quietly, lowering her head as she focused on her meal. Once she finished eating, she gathered her belongings and slipped out of the restaurant without lingering. &#34;Good morning, Kayla.&#34; Edwin appeared at the entrance, a sleek shopping bag from a high-end perfume boutique dangling from one hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla nodded politely, but as she passed, she caught Edwin mutter, &#34;That&#39;s odd. Mr. Graham never wears cologne.What made him want a bottle now?&#34;</p>
