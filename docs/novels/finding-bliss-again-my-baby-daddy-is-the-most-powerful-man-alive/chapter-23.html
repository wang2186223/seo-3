                <p>Flipping through the papers, Jeremy paused, his gaze dark and unreadable.&#34;And what does that have to do with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the desk,Dewvitt leaned in, a grin spreading as mischief twinkled inhis eyes.′′Γ guessing she had a fight with Liamn, which is why she moved out. As Liam&#39;s uncle, you ought to step up and play peacemaker.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must really be running out of ways to entertain yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Light laughter bubbled from Dewitt. &#34;Relax, I&#39;m just poking fun. Even if you marry Zoe and Kayla becomes your slster-in-law, it&#39;s not like you&#39;d have any real say in their drama.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mention of Zoe wiped away any hint of warmth from Jeremy&#39;s face, leaving only icy distance in his posture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the tension, Dewitt wrapped his arms around himself in mock shivers. &#34;All jokes aside,are you really sure about Zoe? Honestly, you two don&#39;t seem like a good fit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking up, Jeremy went back to reviewing the files. &#34;If you&#39;re just here to waste time, do it somewhere else. I&#39;ve got work to finish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt dragged himself to his feet, giving Jeremy a lazy pat on the back. &#34;Still keeping secrets, huh? Fine,fine. I&#39;I let it go. Whoever you wind up with, I&#39;ll always have your back. That&#39;s what good friends are for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right as Dewitt reached the doorway, he spun around, a sudden spark lighting his eyes. &#34;One more thing-l bought into a fancy travel business. They&#39;re doing a soft opening. Two weeks of fun. Come with me. We both need a break.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy shot him a look that could freeze water.′′Admit it, you&#39;re just looking to pick up women. I&#39;m not interested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt slouched against the doorframe, sighing with theatrical disappointment. &#34;Without you around,chasing girls isn&#39;t even fun. Someone&#39;s got to keep me in check, right? And now that you&#39;re with Zoe, I guess I have to double down on finding my own catch.&#34; A dry, amused scoff slipped out of Jeremy. &#34;You? As if you&#39;ve ever had trouble in that department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truth be told, Dewitt was notorious for breaking hearts and cycling through girlfriends like outfits. There wasn&#39;t a woman he couldn&#39;t win over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t say that. I was just making friends with girls. I&#39;m still a virgin, you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Tesponse, Jeremy picked up the nearest book and sent it flying at Dewitt&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick sidestep took Dewitt safely out of range, and he disappeared down the hall before Jeremy could say another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stillness swept through the office again, broken only by the gentle flutter of curtains stirred by the night air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without meaning to, Jeremy found his eyes drawn to the paperwork scattered across his desk.Among the forms, Kayla&#39;s graceful script caught his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how hard he tried to focus, images of Kayla kept flickering in his mind, stubborn and relentless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After catching her breath at the hotel, Kayla made her way over to the care facility later that evening to check on Marsha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of finding Marsha in her room, Kayla was met by the caregiver, who explained that a doctor had taken Marsha for a treatment session. It could be a while before she returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trusting the explanation, Kayla decided not tolinger and headed back to her hotel room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tomorrow, her plans included a trip to the courthouse to apply for the divorce. Saving her energy, seemed wise. After that, a whole new life awaited her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night gave way to dawn in the blink of an eye, sunlight stretching across the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long before the courthouse doors opened, Kayla was already there. She passed the time by sending a couple of messages to Liam, waiting for him to arrive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of hope had filled her the day she registered her marriage with Liam. Now, urgency and a desperate need for freedom replaced that old excitement.Once,marriage had brought comfort. These days, it felt more like a prison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first step toward reclaiming her future meant cutting these final ties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of a familiar voice pulled Kayla from her thoughts. She spun around, her body tense with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the marble floor, Marsha appeared, leaning on Líam&#39;s arm as they slowly approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An instinctive jolt sent Kayla scrambling upright. &#34;Grandma? Why are you even here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sadness etched deep lines into Marsha&#39;s face as she wasted no time launching into her lecture. &#34;What&#39;s gotten into you, Kayla? Liam&#39;s a wonderful husband. Why on earth would you throw him away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold weight pressed down on Kayla&#39;s chest. She shot Liam a glare. &#34;What did you say to her, Liam?Did you drag my grandmother into this on purpose?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With wide, untroubled eyes, Liam looked the picture of innocence. &#34;Kayla, don&#39;t make things so difficult.Let&#39;s just go home, okay? The divorce news crushed Marsha. She just wants us to make things right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disbelief clouded Kayla&#39;s face. &#34;Unbelievable. So this is your new low, Liam? Hauling my grandmother here to guilt me into staying? You never cease to amaze me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy sigh passed Liam&#39;s lips, but his expression stayed gentle. &#34;That&#39;s not fair, Kayla. Marsha is family.She deserves to know what&#39;s going on, and all she wants is for us to be happy together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla straightened her shoulders, her. tone unyielding. &#34;This divorce is happening today. Nothing&#39;s going to change my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely not!&#34; Marsha snapped, her voice rising with fierce determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Helplessness crept over Kayla, the realization settling in that Liam had shamelessly brought Marsha just to force her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doing her best to keep calm, Kayla reached for patience. &#34;Grandma, I need you to stay out of this. Let me &#34;What more is there to talk about? Liam&#39;s been nothing but good to you. He told me you&#39;ve been upset lately, but that&#39;s no excuse for making such a reckless decision. Do you have any idea how much a divorce can damage a woman&#39;s reputation?&#34; said Marsha, shooting down the idea with a wave of her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of tradition shaped Marsha&#39;s thinking, and Kayla knew there was little hope of changing her mind. In Marsha&#39;s world, divorce was a scandal that doomed a woman to gossip and loneliness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bracing herself, Kayla held her ground. &#34;Grandma, you don&#39;t know everything. Liam and I are done. There&#39;s nothing left to fix.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chiming in, Liam tried again, putting on a wounded act. &#34;Honey, if this is about my secretary, I&#39;ll let her go first thing tomorrow. Don&#39;t do this over something so small, please.&#34;</p>
