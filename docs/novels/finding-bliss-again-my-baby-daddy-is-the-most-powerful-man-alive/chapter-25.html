                <p>Seated in the exam room, Kayla listened as the doctor said, &#34;Ma&#39;am, you gave yourself quite a fright with that scare today. It&#39;s important to take things slow and try to keep your stress in check.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes drifting to the paperwork on the table, she let her hand settle gently over her still-smooth stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following the chaos with Liam earlier, she had retreated to the hotel. But an uneasy feeling crept in as soon as she lay down, sending her straight to the hospital without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over her when the doctor assured her it was nothing too serious. Any worse, and she might have lost her grip entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pregnancy hadn&#39;t thriled her at first. Yet, as the weeks went on, she found herself growing attached, even a little protective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile flickered as she answered, &#34;Thanks, doctor. I&#39;ll take care of myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a prescription for stabilizing medication in hand, Kayla collected what she needed and prepared to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla?&#34; someone called from down the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound made her jump. She quickly slipped the medicine bag behind her and looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin appeared, looking surprised. &#34;What a coincidence!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Jeremy here?&#34; Kayla asked, her eyes darting to the cluster of bodyguards nearby. That kind of security detail was unmistakable-Jeremy must be in the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin confirmed her suspicion with a nod.&#34;He′Sjust here for a bandage change. Should be finishing up any minute now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That mention jolted Kayla&#39;s memory. She remembered the injury on Jeremy&#39;s arm-the one she had caused. Edwin asked, &#34;Would you like to see him while you&#39;re here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An immediate shake of her head followed. &#34;No. I have things I need to take care of. Maybe another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way she&#39;d go looking for Jeremy. Avoiding him felt like the only sensible option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Edwin added, &#34;By the way, Mr. Graham had us review Perennia Group&#39;s records yesterday. Some problems turned up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of problems?&#34; Kayla asked, confused. It had been a year since she&#39;d had any involvement with Perennia Group, and she had no clue what mess Liam might have created.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment of silence passed before Edwin answered, &#34;You don&#39;t know anything about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A firm note crept into Kayla&#39;s voice. &#34;Just tell me what&#39;s going on:&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a nervous scratch to his nose, Edwin replied, &#34;You should ask Mr.Graham.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla pressed on, frowning. &#34;Why send me to Jeremy when you&#39;re the one standing here with all the answers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If she doesn&#39;t want to see me, why push her?&#34; said a crisp, icy voice that sliced through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, the hairs on Kayla&#39;s neck stood up as a shiver darted down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin turned and nodded respectfully. &#34;Mr.Graham.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharp in his tailored black suit, Jeremy exuded both elegance and authority, drawing subtle glances from everyone in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His steps rang out with quiet confidence as he sauntered over, hands tucked into his pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep breath steadied Kayla before she turned, masking her nerves with a polite smile.&#34;What are the odds we&#39;d run into each other here, Jeremy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With nothing more than a frosty look, Jeremy dismissed her attempt at pleasantries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin moved ahead to hold open the car door, waiting as Jeremy leaned down and slipped into the back</p>
                
                
                
                <p>seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to get answers about Perennia Group, Kayla tucked her medication away and moved closer to the open window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jeremy, would you mind explaining what exactly is wrong with Perennia Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reclining against the leather seat, Jeremy kept his eyes closed, offering her nothing but silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jeremy?&#34; Kayla tried again, her patience wearing thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin interjected, &#34;You should come with us. Mr. Graham is on a tight schedule and can&#39;t afford to be late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not seeing another way, Kayla climbed into the car, her mind churning with questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy, uncomfortable silence pressed down on the car as it rolled forward, making Kayla fidget in her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when they reached a red light did Jeremy finally break the silence, his tone glacial. &#34;Didn&#39;t you insist on keeping your distance? What changed your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you&#39;re misreading the situation. I just didn&#39;t want to be a bother...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sentence was cut short when the car jerked to a halt, sending her forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thrown off balance, Kayla collided with Jeremy&#39;s chest, momentarily stunned by the firm impact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head spun for a moment after bumping into the solid wall of his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy caught her by the waist, his other hand lifting her chin as his voice turned cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Funny how you weren&#39;t so concerned about being a bother when you came running to me for help with Perennia Group.&#34;</p>
