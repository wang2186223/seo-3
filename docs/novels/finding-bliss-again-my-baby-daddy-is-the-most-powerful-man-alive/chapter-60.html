                <p>A hush filled the room,each of Jeremy&#39;s footsteps.slicing through the silence with unmistakable clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressed flat against the bookshelf, Kayla could barely breathe. Her heart hammered wildly, every thump threatening to give away her hiding spot as his shadow drew closer with every measured step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy took his time, eyes methodically sweeping over every inch of the space before settling on the bookshelf&#39;s edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abruptly,he paused, flicking droplets from the sheet music he held. &#34;Are you going to step out on your own,or should I come pull you out myself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla held her breath, paralyzed-neither brave enough to answer nor bold enough to reveal herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight,Jeremy seemed in no hurry, his patience tinged with something almost predatory. He lingered,letting the silence grow heavy, then spoke again. &#34;You were bold enough to sneak into my room and play my piano,but now you can&#39;t even reveal yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few ragged breaths, Kayla mustered her courage. She squeezed her eyes shut for a heartbeat,then emerged from her hiding place, moving with the awkward stiffness of someone desperately trying not to be noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Edwin&#39;s voice shattered the tension.&#34;Mr. Graham, urgent news!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, Kayla darted right back behind the bookshelf,vanishing once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy,catching the glimpse of her retreat, couldn&#39;t hide the flash of irritation in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Graham?&#34; Edwin&#39;s persistent knocking rattled the door, refusing to be ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, Jeremy turned and exited the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her chance, Kayla wasted no time. She slipped the window open and slipped outside, careful not to make a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Edwin relayed his message at the door.&#34;Your father insists you escort Zoe home tonight. If you refuse, he&#39;ll have her stay here as your guest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no universe in which Jeremy would allow Zoe to spend the night at the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on.&#34; Stepping back inside, Jeremy noticed the vacant spot behind the bookshelf. The open window left no doubt-his mysterious pianist had already slipped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze caught a glint beneath the sill. Bending down,he retrieved a ring-an exact match for his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow flickered across his face as he quietly tucked the ring into his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Kayla raced toward the main hall, nerves jangling with every hurried step. The last thing she wanted was to be intercepted by Jeremy&#39;s staff. In her rush, she nearly crashed into Janiya, who had just appeared in her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance flashed in Janiya&#39;s eyes as she recoiled and pressed a hand to her chest. &#34;What&#39;s the hurry? You can&#39;t just run wild here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a word of protest crossed Kayla&#39;s lips. She kept her expression neutral and let the criticism slide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawn by the noise, Liam joined them, worry etched into his brow. &#34;What&#39;s going on, Mom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp finger jabbed in Kayla&#39;s direction as Janiya launched her complaint. &#34;Your wife nearly bowled me over. Can&#39;t she watch where she&#39;s going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam shot Kayla a quick glance, then attempted to smooth things over. &#34;Mom, I&#39;m sure Kayla didn&#39;t mean it. You&#39;re always so understanding. There&#39;s no reason to take it to heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A daughter-in-law like her is an embarrassment to us all!&#34; Janiya flicked her sleeve in disgust before pulling Liam aside for a private word. &#34;Listen closely, both of you-tonight, you and Jeremy are personally responsible for getting Zoe home safely. That&#39;s an order from my father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Privately, Kayla nearly laughed at their obsessive coddling of Zoe. Even Jeremy didn&#39;t show half as much concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, Mom,&#34; Liam replied dutifully. &#34;I&#39;ll make sure both Uncle Jeremy and Zoe return without a hitch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Liam took Kayla by the hand.and guided her out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only at the entrance did she finally manage to free herself from his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Already, Jeremy&#39;s motorcade was perfectly lined up,each car gleaming in the night. Zoe swept out of the villa surrounded by a flock of servants, her eyes narrowed in a smug, challenging look aimed straight at Kayla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of annoyance washed over Kayla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in close, Liam whispered, &#34;Let&#39;s go. We&#39;ll take the car behind Uncle Jeremy&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had barely set foot toward the back when Edwin intercepted them. &#34;MMr. Graham wants you both to join him in his car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Liam and Kayla exchanged startled looks at the unexpected invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough,the convoy rolled away from the estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the roomy,well-appointed car, the four rode together. Refreshments and snacks were neatly arranged,giving the whole ride an oddly luxurious air. Jeremy sat apart, eyes closed, an unmistakable chill emanating from him as he toyed absently with a ring.No one dared break the heavy silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stiffness crept into Kayla&#39;s back from sitting so rigidly.She shifted her legs, only to accidentally tap Jeremy&#39;s shoe with her foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, she drew her foot away and shot a nervous glance at him. He didn&#39;t move-a statue, eyes still closed, betraying no reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Kayla, and she quietly exhaled,grateful she hadn&#39;t disturbed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their progress soon ground to a halt-a traffic accident had brought all cars to a standstill, trapping the convoy on the crowded road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of nausea rolled through Kayla&#39;s stomach,forcing her to crack the window for a breath of fresh air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost immediately, Zoe wrinkled her nose in exaggerated disgust. &#34;Ugh, the air outside is disgusting.Kayla,would you mind shutting the window?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of irritation flickered across Kayla&#39;s face as she shot Zoe a glare. &#34;I need the air, so I&#39;m leaving it open.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confidence from Johnny&#39;s open favoritism gave Zoe an extra push. &#34;But the rest of us are suffering.The smell is unbearable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annovance sharpened Kayla&#39;s voice. &#34;If you ask me you&#39;re making it up. I don&#39;t notice any bad smell at all.Besides,Jeremy hasn&#39;t complained. Maybe your sense of smell is just overly sensitive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s expression soured, clearly stunned that Kayla would dare contradict her so bluntly. With a practiced sweetness, she turned to Jeremy and tried again.&#34;Jeremy, don&#39;t you agree the window should be closed?&#34;</p>
