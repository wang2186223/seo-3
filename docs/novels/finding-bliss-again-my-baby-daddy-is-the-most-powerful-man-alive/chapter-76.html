                <p>Kayla flinched slightly when she heard her name,blurting out without thinking, &#34;I still need to go back to the company. I can&#39;t stay long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy shot her a cold, sharp look. &#34;I&#39;ll talk to Archie about this. I&#39;m sure you can spare a few minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her mouth as if to argue but thought better of it and fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy then turned to his secretary and gave a small nod. &#34;Set up the piano. Kayla will be playing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the conference room, Zane was already seated,being attended to by the secretary with polite conversation and refreshments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jeremy and Kayla walked in together,Zane looked genuinely surprised. &#34;What a coincidence Kayla,you&#39;re here too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gave him a polite nod and smiled, then instinctively walked over to the piano. A piece of sheet music had already been placed on the stand-it was one she recognized and could play without trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced over at Jeremy. &#34;I only had a few piano lessons when I was younger. I&#39;m not very skilled.&#34; Jeremy,now seated beside Zane, said calmly, &#34;Just play.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla nodded.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zane smiled gently, his eyes full of expectation as he looked forward to hearing her play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy had already asked the staff to leave the room.It was just the three of them now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft piano notes slowly filled the room, wrapping the space in a quiet calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zane reached for the folder in front of him, ready to discuss the contract, but when he glanced up, he paused. Jeremy wasn&#39;t even looking at the documents -his eyes were locked on Kayla, completely absorbed in her performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zane looked between the two of them, a knowing smile playing at his lips, but he said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla played three pieces in a row. As the final note faded, Jeremy finally turned his focus back to business, and the conversation with Zane began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the discussion went on, Kayla&#39;s phone, which was sitting on the table, started to vibrate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She checked the caller ID, picked it up, and quietly walked out of the conference room to take the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is something wrong?&#34; she asked, her tone dropping the moment she heard the caregiver&#39;s voice. The voice on the other end was filled with worry.&#34;Kayla, your grandmother ate breakfast this morning,but now she&#39;s saying her stomach hurts. You&#39;d better come quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I&#39;m on my way now.&#34; Kayla ended the call,turned back to the conference room, and paused when she saw Jeremy and Zane deep in discussion.She didn&#39;t want to interrupt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Edwin happened to walk by. She quickly approached him. &#34;I have an emergency and need to go. Could you please let Jeremy know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin took one look at her worried expression and gave a small nod. &#34;Understood. Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jeremy stepped out and found the room empty,a strange wave of emptiness crept over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in his office, he leaned back in his chair and lit a cigarette. The smoke curled upward as he sat in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin walked in moments later. &#34;Mr. Graham, I&#39;ve seen Mr. Campbell off. He agreed to let us handle next month&#39;s bidding project.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy responded with a quiet hum, but there was no enthusiasm behind it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin added, &#34;Kayla had something urgent come up.She asked me to let you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>leremy didn&#39;t reply right away. He tapped the ash from his cigarette into the tray, then finally spoke. &#34;What about the investigation I assigned you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve asked the hotel for the full list of guests from that night. We&#39;re going through the records one by one. We&#39;ll find her eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;No matter what it takes, I need to know who the woman in my room that night was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Kayla arrived at the care facility, rushing down the hallway. She opened the door to find Marsha lying peacefully in bed, already asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her surprise, Liam was seated beside the bed,gently adjusting the blanket. When he noticed Kayla enter, he stood and gave her a reassuring smile.&#34;Don&#39;t worry. Marsha&#39;s alright now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla frowned and asked in a cold voice, &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s talk outside,&#34; Liam said, leading her out of the room and quietly closing the door behind them. &#34;I had the doctor take a look at her. They said she ate something that didn&#39;t sit well, but luckily, it wasn&#39;t too much. The doctor also mentioned that she needs more family around-her memory and awareness are starting to slip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla nodded once. &#34;Got it. You can leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as she turned to go back inside, Liam grabbed her hand and pulled her back against the wall. His tone softened,his eyes full of emotion. &#34;Kayla, let&#39;s forget the past and start over. We can take Marsha home and take care of her together. She&#39;d be so happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Kayla didn&#39;t shove him away. But her eyes turned icy, and her voice was like steel. &#34;Liam, what makes you think you have the right to say that to me?&#34;</p>
