                <p>By eleven o&#39;clock that night, the Graham family&#39;s grand estate was still ablaze with light, nearly every family member assembled in the vast hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the center of it all, Kayla held her head high, posture uwavering, a glacial calm set across her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa, you asked me to come home right away. What&#39;s so urgent?&#34; Liam entered at a brisk pace,confusion flickering across his face. His steps faltered as his eyes landed on Kayla, shock settling over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had called and messaged Kayla countless times but got no response, yet here she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered no explanation, remaining as distant as ever, her expression carved from ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,Johnny seized his water glass and hurled it at Liam. A cold splash spread across Liam&#39;s shirt and jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya sprang to Liam&#39;s side, arms spread protectively. &#34;Dad, please don&#39;t lose your temper! We haven&#39;t even heard his side yet. What if this is all just a big misunderstanding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage flushed Johnny&#39;s face an angry red. He jabbed a shaking finger at Liam, voice thundering across the room.&#34;You call yourself a Graham? How could you do something so disgraceful? Your actions have humiliated this entire family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Utterly bewildered, Liam brushed Janiya&#39;s hands away and stepped closer to his grandfather. &#34;Grandpa,you&#39;re furious, but I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m accused of. At least tell me what&#39;s happened!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny flung a phone at him, hisanger so intense it triggered a fit of coughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quick as ever, Janiya hurried to Johnny&#39;s side, steadying him and casting a pointed glare at Kayla.&#34;Dad,please don&#39;t jump to conclusions just because of what Kayla might&#39;ve told you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a word passed Kayla&#39;s lips; she remained a silent observer, her demeanor unchanging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam picked up the phone from the floor and unlocked the screen. The blood drained from his face as he stared at the display. The screen was filled with photo after photo-he and Tricia, tangled together in bed,their compromising position splashed across entertainment headlines. The bold caption screamed, &#34;Liam Graham Caught in Affair, Betraying His Wife!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every image was clear as day, capturing their rumpled clothes and the intimacy of their embrace for the world to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color drained from Liam&#39;s faceas he absorbed the photos on the phone. Rage simmered in his eyes when he whipped his head toward Kayla. Voice sharp and trembling, he hissed, &#34;You set me up, didn&#39;t you? You planted someone at the hotel to catch me in the act!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, knowing smile crept across Kayla&#39;s lips as she addressed Johnny instead. &#34;You heard him. He just confessed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Explosive fury overtook Johnny. He snatched up his cane and lashed out, striking Liam&#39;s back before Janiya threw herself in the way and shielded her son from further blows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Struggling for breath, Johnny spat, &#34;How many warnings have I given you? Never do anything to disgrace the Graham name! Did you even listen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amid Johnny&#39;s outburst, Kayla&#39;s heart filled with scorn. The hypocrisy was almost laughable. She knew all too well that Johnny had always been aware of Liam&#39;s affair-he&#39;d simply told her to endure it for the family&#39;s image. But now, with the whole world watching, he was ready to play the role of the indignant patriarch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Kayla stood in silent contempt, a new presence appeared in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy walked in, having gotten word of the scandal himself. The moment he entered, he caught the charged energy in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya wasted no time rushing to him, desperation etched on her face. &#34;Jeremy, you have to help Liam! The stories on the internet-they&#39;re all lies. Somebody is out to destroy him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unreadable look passed over Jeremy&#39;s face as he glanced at Kayla. His reply came out crisp and unsympathetic. &#34;The proof is everywhere. Trying to bury this now would only make things worse.&#34; Still, Janiya insisted, &#34;Please! If you don&#39;t do something, his future is finished!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stepped forward, her words slicing through the room.&#34;1fyou understood how much damage this would cause, why let him get away with it in the first place? Now you want to play the victim? That&#39;s rich.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outrage twisted Janiya&#39;s features as she spun on Kayla. &#34;How dare you! If Liam&#39;s name is dragged through the mud, yours is too. What could you possibly gain from this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short, cold laugh escaped Kayla. &#34;His lack of self-control is not my burden. Since he&#39;s crossed the line,I want only one thing-a divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words hit like a slap. Liam stormed toward Kayla, jabbing a finger inches from her face.&#34;So that&#39;s it?This is all just a ploy for divorce? Forget it. I won&#39;t let you go that easily!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla faced him without a hint of fear. &#34;Your choices are no longer yours alone. The whole city knows your scandals now. If you&#39;re hoping to save face, I&#39;d suggest you grant the divorce quietly. Refuse, and I&#39;ll see to it your reputation never recovers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, Jeremy settled comfortably into an armchair, watching the chaos unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had learned about Liam&#39;s affair trending online while working at the company. Sensing Kayla&#39;s fingerprints all over the uproar, he hadn&#39;t hesitated to show up for tonight&#39;s family showdown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Muscles tensed, Liam&#39;s hands balled into fists, fury twisting his features. &#34;Don&#39;t push your luck, Kayla!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla replied, &#34;You&#39;re the only one doing any pushing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her attention flicked to his slowly rising hand, but her cold, challenging smile didn&#39;t waver. Closing the distance between them, she fixed him with a gaze sharp enough to draw blood. &#34;Thinking of hitting me? Go on, Liam. All that will do is give me one more charge-domestic violence.&#34;</p>
