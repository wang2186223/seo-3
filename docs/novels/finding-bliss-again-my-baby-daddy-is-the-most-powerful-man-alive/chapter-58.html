                <p>A moment of hesitation caught Kayla, her grip tightening unconsciously around the fork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither Janiya nor Liam spoke up in her defense,choosing to stay silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in a steadying breath,Kayla replied with calm resolve, &#34;I&#39;ve already made myself clear-who Jeremy chooses to date is entirely his concern. Yet Janiya had to drag me into it. Janiya, if you&#39;re really worried about his love life, why not ask him? There&#39;s no reason to put the blame on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya&#39;s expression changed at that, and she quickly turned to Jeremy in an attempt to smooth things over.&#34;Jeremy, it&#39;s not like that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough,&#34; Jeremy interjected sharply. &#34;My personal life isn&#39;t up for discussion. Going forward, I don&#39;t want anyone interfering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely controlled irritation laced Jeremy&#39;s voice. A heavy tension settled over the table, each person caught up in their own thoughts, yet no one daring to break the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny cleared his throat and turned to Jeremy &#34;Jeremy, I think Zoe is a fine young woman. What are your intentions toward her?&#34; &#34;I&#39;ll take responsibility for what happened between Zoe and me, but this isn&#39;t something you get a say in.&#34;With that, Jeremy rose from his seat without touching his food, leaving the room behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lack of even basic courtesy toward Johnny underscored the deep rift between father and son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, his words set off a wave of understanding around the table. It was obvious to everyone-Jeremy and Zoe&#39;s relationship had already crossed a line, and a wedding was surely in their future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe, tense just moments before, now radiated joy after hearing Jeremy&#39;s declaration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As dinner ended, Janiya insisted Kayla give Zoe a tour of the property. Eager for any excuse to leave the stifling dining room, Kayla quickly agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out in the garden, life pulsed in every corner. Fresh green leaves fluttered in the gentle wind, and the air was sweet with the scent of new growth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although it was her first time setting foot in this garden, Kayla found nothing of interest. Upon reaching the pavilion, she refused to continue and claimed a spot on a stone bench.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Zoe remained lively, her mood lifted even higher by the envious glances they&#39;d received from the staff along the path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing in her tracks, Zoe threw an impatient look over her shoulder. &#34;Why are you just sitting there?I&#39;m not finished looking around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla leaned back on the bench, crossed her legs,and popped a snack in her mouth. &#34;You&#39;ve got feet,haven&#39;t you? Go on and wander by yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sour look flashed across Zoe&#39;s face. She marched over, towering above Kayla with a clear sense of self -importance. &#34;Your mother-in-law told you to show me around. If you slack off, I won&#39;t hesitate to let her know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered, Kayla merely shrugged with a look of total indifference. &#34;Be my guest. I&#39;m already on the outs with her and her son, so tattle all you like. Makes no difference to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe faltered, caught off guard by Kayla&#39;s apathy. Her mind scrambled for a new angle until she recalled the look of bitterness on Kayla&#39;s face during dinner, as if the world owed her something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly smirk tugged at Zoe&#39;s lips as she settled down across from Kayla, her words thick with arrogance &#34;You must be jealous, Kayla.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla arched an eyebrow. &#34;Jealous of what, exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she supposed to be jealous of Zoe&#39;s obliviousness-so blind she let Janiya use her like a pawn?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Johnny made my position official tonight. I&#39;m going to marry Jeremy-nothing can stop me now.&#34; Zoe beamed, as if she was already Jeremy&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh. Sounds like you finally got what you wanted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe,emboldened by Kayla&#39;s lack of enthusiasm, let her tongue run wild. &#34;No matter what you do, you&#39;ll never come close to my level. You grew up.motherless-girls like you don&#39;t even deserve a comparison.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of her mother turned Kayla&#39;s expression to frost. Without a word, she scooped up a handful of snacks and hurled them straight at Zoe&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe let out a startled shriek, leaping to her feet as snacks grazed her cheek. &#34;Are you crazy? What&#39;s wrong with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say one more word about my mother, and next time,it won&#39;t be something so harmless.&#34; Kayla brushed the crumbs from her hands, shot Zoe a look of pure disdain, and strode off without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just you wait, Kayla! When I marry Jeremy, you&#39;ll be the one begging for mercy!&#34; Fuming, Zoe raisedher voice after her. Her fists clenched at her sides,trembling with frustration and helpless anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Zoe left behind, Kayla relished her brief freedom.She strolled through the estate&#39;s winding paths,searching for the quickest escape from this suffocating display of family pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she wanted was to be back in her own peaceful home,far from this toxic atmosphere. Drawn by the sound of soft piano notes, she paused near one of the villa&#39;s side buildings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gentle melody tugged at her curiosity.She crept to a back window, lifted the curtain just enough, and peeked inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bathed in warm light, Jeremy sat alone at the piano,his posture relaxed as his fingers glided effortlessly over the keys,filling the room with music.</p>
