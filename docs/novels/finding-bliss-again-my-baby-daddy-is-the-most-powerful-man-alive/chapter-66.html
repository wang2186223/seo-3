                <p>Jeremy paced the hospital corridor, restless. Dewitt called, explaining he&#39;d smoothed things over with the guy and sent him home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt&#39;s voice was laced with remorse over what happened to Kayla. &#34;Total fluke. I didn&#39;t even realize that dude was staking out my hotel. I&#39;ll swing by with something for Kayla-apologize in person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Handle your mess. Don&#39;t let this kind of thing happen again.&#34; With that, Jeremy ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Zoe&#39;s name lit up on his screen. He answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint cough came through. &#34;Hey, Jeremy. I&#39;m home now.You good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy cast a quick glance at the exam room door,his voice dropping. &#34;I&#39;ve got something going on right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe let out another exaggerated cough. &#34;Still grinding this late? You&#39;ve got to ease up sometime. If you need anything, I&#39;m around. I mean, I can&#39;t fix your deadlines,but I can chat, at least. Oh-and my mom has been pestering me to invite you over for dinner...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe kept going, her words tumbling out. Jeremy&#39;s patience was wearing thin, but he stayed silent,waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The exam room door swung open, and Jeremy saw his moment. &#34;I&#39;ve got to run, Zoe. I&#39;ve got a lot on my plate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could reply, the line went dead. Zoe stared at her phone, insulted. She was practically hacking up a lung, and he didn&#39;t even ask if she was okay?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t he supposed to send someone right away with the cold medicine?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still holding her phone, Zoe muttered, &#34;Jeremy&#39;s probably swamped. I&#39;ll find him once he&#39;s got a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Jeremy tucked his phone away and approached the exam room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor stepped out, carrying a tray of used supplies from treating Kayla&#39;s injury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy asked, &#34;How is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; Kayla called from the wheelchair. She didn&#39;t think she needed it, but the doctor hadn&#39;t budged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla held her bandaged arm, her face pale but her eyes still bright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about me, Jeremy. The doctor saysI&#39;ve just been running myself into the ground, and tonight didn&#39;t help. A couple of days of rest, and I&#39;ll be back.&#34; Jeremy looked to the doctor for confirmation. &#34;That right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor nodded. &#34;Yes. The cut&#39;s slightly inflamed,but it&#39;s under control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; Jeremy gave a curt nod. Then, without another word, he turned and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla exhaled a huge breath of relief. She turned to the doctor. &#34;Thanks a lot, really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By pure luck, it was the same doctor who&#39;d handled her prenatal appointment. He already knew. She&#39;d begged him not to say anything about her pregnancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her a concerned look. &#34;The cut&#39;s manageable,but the stress tonight stirred things up with the baby.You&#39;ve got to take it easy. No more pushing yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hear you, doc. Thanks,&#34; Kayla said as she headed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She assumed Jeremy had long gone, but as she stepped into the night air, his car was still out front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the bodyguards approached. &#34;It&#39;s late. Mr.Graham&#39;s taking you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking,Kayla blurted, &#34;Can I say no?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguard blinked, caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla spotted Jeremy watching from the car. She sighed. &#34;Fine. Thanks for the ride.&#34; Inside the car, exhaustion crashed over her. She leaned her head against the window, barely staying awake. Jeremy&#39;s voice cut through. &#34;You took a hit for me tonight. Getting you to the hospital is just evening the score.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla figured he was trying to clear any debt,probably thinking she&#39;d cling to this as leverage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured a quiet &#34;okay&#34; and let her eyes close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy thought she hadn&#39;t heard. But when he looked over, she was out cold, her expression peaceful,lashes fanned out like soft ink strokes on her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found himself staring, caught off guard by the stillness in her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re here at her spot, Mr. Graham,&#34; the driver said suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy looked outside, his brow tightening as he took in the rough neighborhood. &#34;Liam has got Kayla living somewhere like this?&#34;</p>
