                <p>&#34;Kayla!&#34; Liam&#39;s voice rang out from afar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s brows knit slightly before he let go of Kayla&#39;s wrist. &#34;You can go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t wait-she turned and rushed off immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin stepped forward, offering him a handkerchief.&#34;Mr. Graham, what just happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy took the handkerchief,wiping his hands slowly,his expression unreadable. &#34;Nothing. I thought she looked familiar-like the woman from that night-but I must have been mistaken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, sir. I&#39;ll figure out who snuck into your room that night. Just give me a little more time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s eyes drifted away, a strange look passing across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t forget the woman from that night. She&#39;d seemed so untouched, trembling under his fingertips,  tears running silently down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still remembered her eyes-clear and bright,drawing him in irresistibly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Kayla spotted Liam scanning the area,clearly searching for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She calmed herself and walked over. &#34;I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam rushed toward her, gripping her shoulders tightly.&#34;Where were you? I thought something had happened.I was worried sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla instinctively leaned back, inching away from his hold. &#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam glanced over her shoulder, clearly wanting to ask more, but she&#39;d already started walking ahead, cutting the conversation short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, sleep refused to come. Kayla tossed in bed,her mind haunted by Jeremy&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never imagined that he-the man from that night -would turn out to be Liam&#39;s uncle. The thought alone was enough to make her stomach twist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had heard the stories. Jeremy was ruthless. The kind of man who crushed competitors without blinking.He wasn&#39;t someone you crossed. Her hand moved instinctively to her stomach. She couldn&#39;t keep this baby. If the Graham family found out,the consequences would be beyond anything she could handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d go to the hospital in the morning and take care of it-quietly, before things got worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her decision made, Kayla slipped out of bed to grab a glass of water. As she reached the staircase,she heard Liam&#39;s voice downstairs, sharp and angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This project has to go through, no matter what.I don&#39;t care how you do it; finda way to fill that funding gap. We&#39;ve already poured too much into it. Failure isn&#39;t an option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounded angry, and once the call ended,he hung up with a sharp, frustrated motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla couldn&#39;t help but wonder what had gone wrong with the company to leave him sounding so frantic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the front door opening and shutting echoed through the empty hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam walked out, started his car, and drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla made her way downstairs, filled a glass with water in the quiet kitchen. Then, her phone buzzed with a message from her private investigator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Graham, Mr Graham has gone to Tricia&#39;s. He&#39;s likely staying the night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, mocking smile tugged at Kayla&#39;s lips. There was no hurt left. Only a hollow calm where disappointment used to live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, she drove herself to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d expected it to be simple and quick. But the doctor&#39;s words shattered every bit of that hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am, your uterine lining is quite thin. In your condition, undergoing an abortion could make it difficult, if not impossible, for you to conceive again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla sat frozen, the words echoing in her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t go through with the abortion,yet carrying the baby wasn&#39;t something she could risk either.She was trapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor&#39;s voice softened. &#34;Maybe talk this through with your husband. This isn&#39;t a small decision-it carries real risks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand,&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla left the room feeling like she&#39;d just been hit by a wave. Her thoughts spun out of control. If she didn&#39;t end the pregnancy, she&#39;d eventually have  to give birth, and there was no way Liam wouldn&#39;t find out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only one way forward now: divorce Liam before her pregnancy became noticeable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still lost in thought, Kayla didn&#39;t see the figure in front of her and ran straight into someone&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Graham,are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s heart dropped. She looked up and found Jeremy standing there, tall and still as a statue, those intense eyes locked on her like she was a puzzle he was about to solve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, Kayla instinctively tucked the medical report behind her back. &#34;Jeremy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t reply. He studied her closely, sensing something off. She&#39;d been acting strange the night before and still was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguard pointed to the floor and reminded her,&#34;You knocked over Mr. Graham&#39;s medication.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did she notice the bag of pills spilled near her feet-various bottles, all supplements for sexual stamina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy looked strong and full of energy, yet he apparently relied on supplements. But that night, his  stamina had been unquestionable-he hadn&#39;t seemed like someone who needed any help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla glanced up, eyes flickering with quiet disbelief and a strange mix of curiosity.</p>
