                <p>Jeremy tapped his fingers lightly against the tabletop,his expression cold and detached</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When Zane and I first expanded business overseas,we designed these pair of rings together It became a symbol of our partnership. Today,you saved his son Giving you that ring was his way of saying thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla held up the ring and twirled it between her fingers with a smile. &#34;Well, I guess today is my lucky day Who would have thought I&#39;d end up wearing the same ring as you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy stared at her in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The humor in Kayla&#39;s voice dimmed. She lowered the ring and cleared her throat. &#34;Anyway, let&#39;s talk business What&#39;s your opinion on my proposal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s tone was cold. &#34;You&#39;re smart, but I don&#39;t like people trying to bargain with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gave a soft laugh. &#34;Is that a no?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed silent, his sharp gaze locked on her, steady and intense</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold shiver crawled down Kayla&#39;s back. She looked away,her eyes darting to the side, too uneasy to hold his stare</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Jeremy leaned back in his leather chair,his tone suddenly casual but pointed. &#34;Every time you see me,you look nervous. Or like you&#39;ve done something wrong. Mind telling me why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla forced a light chuckle. &#34;you&#39;re kind of a big deal Someone like me is bound to feel a little intimidated You probably don&#39;t even realize the pressure you bring with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not being honest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;|am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy rested his head on one hand, his every move smooth and controlled, giving off the kind of presence that filled a room without trying</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you here on behalf of Perennia Group for yourself or for Liam?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla tilted her head. &#34;Does it matter? I co-founded it with him. It&#39;s as much mine as it is his.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Graham.&#34; Edwin walked in just then with a document in hand. &#34;Mr. Campbell has agreed to move forward with the partnership next quarter Here&#39;s the signed contract.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy took it and skimmed the pages</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had known Zane for a long time and understood how he operated-sharp-minded and always chasing profit. He hadn&#39;t planned on renewing their deal for the next quarter, which had been weighing on Jeremy&#39;s mind. But now, out of the blue, Zane had signed without the slightest pushback, and that caught Jeremy off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy raised his eyes and gave Kayla a long.deliberate look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her brows with a playful smile. &#34;Did Mr Campbell sign because I saved his kid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re clever, but don&#39;t try to use that cleverness on me,&#34; Jeremy said flatly as he dropped the contract onto the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t on purpose. I had no idea who that boy&#39;s father was. I just did what anyone should&#39;ve done.&#34;Her wide eyes and soft voice gave off a harmless energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jeremy wasn&#39;t buying it. She wasn&#39;t naive. She knew how to play the part well enough to disarm anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You brought your own contract, didn&#39;t you?&#34; he asked &#34;Yes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla snapped back to attention, quickly digging into her bag She pulled out the folder and placed it on the desk in front of him with both hands, maintaining a calm expression despite the excitement bubbling inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy opened the folder and began flipping through His long fingers glided smoothly across the paper as he read</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stood quietly beside him, but her eyes kept drifting. His lashes were dark and thick, shadowing his eyes His jaw was sharp, his skin clear, and his perfectly shaped lips looked both handsome and distant</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This man was truly a masterpiece</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla couldn&#39;t help but stare, enthralled and lost</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you draft this yourself?&#34; Jeremy asked When there was no response, he glanced and caught her staring</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes locked, and for a split second, it felt like a spark jumped between them A chill ran down both their spines</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, what did you say?&#34; Kayla stammered, flustered What a daydreamer she was!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy narrowed his eyes &#34;I asked if you wrote this contract yourself Does Liam know about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my decision I&#39;m the one leading this project,&#34;Kayla replied,regaining her composure. She leaned in to point at a section in the document, bringing herself closer to him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she moved, a soft, floral scent drifted across the table It caught Jeremy off guard. His fingers froze against the page</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That scent-warm and familiar-wrapped around him like a quiet whisper. It stirred something strange in his chest</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t understand why it affected him so much</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla pointed at a clause. &#34;As I said earlier, I&#39;ll transfer my shares to you. It&#39;s all in here. Once you sign,I&#39;ll inform the legal team. And don&#39;t worry-I&#39;m not using what happened with Mr. Campbell&#39;s son to ask forany favors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who said you could stand that close?&#34; Jeremy&#39;s voice was low and intimidating</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla immediately stepped back &#34;I just wanted to make sure you could  see the clause clearly.&#34; &#34;I can see just fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy straightened his tie, picked up the pen beside him, and signed the document with a smooth, steady hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla watched every stroke of his signature, trying hard to contain her excitement. Her fingers curled tightly around the hem of her dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finished, Jeremy slid the contract across the table. &#34;You can go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34; She quickly gathered the papers and turned to leave, acting quite nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after the door closed behind her, the faint trace of her perfume lingered in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy sat back in his chair, tugged at his tie again,and huffed in irritation. He pulled out a cigarette, lit it,and took a long drag, trying to push away the heat crawling under his skin.</p>
