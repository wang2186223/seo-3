                <p>The next morning, just as Kayla was getting ready to resume talks with Jeremy about the business collaboration, her phone rang. The call was from the care facility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grandmother had suddenly relapsed and had been rushed to the emergency room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Kayla got there, the crisis had passed and her grandmother&#39;s condition was stable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to the doctor, her voice tense. &#34;Dr.Crawford, you mentioned before that my grandmother was improving. How did things go downhill so fast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adair Crawford replied honestly,&#34;Yesterday, your stepmother and sister came to visit. I&#39;m not sure what they said, but shortly after they left, her condition worsened. And...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran down Kayla&#39;s spine. &#34;And what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They canceled her upcoming treatment and requested a refund for the unused portion of the fees.&#34; Kayla&#39;s face hardened Zoe had already mentioned they wouldn&#39;t continue covering the expenses-and now they were backing out completely</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said firmly, &#34;My grandmother&#39;s treatment must continue without interruption. Dr. Crawford, please keep monitoring her closely. I&#39;ll handle the payments myself&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adair gave a respectful nod. &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the hospital room, the elderly woman lay unconscious, her skin ashen and drawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla sat beside her, cradling her grandmother&#39;s frail hand,her chest tight with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t let anything happen to you,Grandma.If Zoe and her mother want to play dirty, they&#39;re going to pay for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By nightfall, her grandmother stirred awake and managed to drink a little soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla remained at her side, chatting with her until her grandmother drifted off to sleep. Then she quietly left the facility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once outside, she called the Coopers. The housekeeper answered, informing her that Zoe and her mother were out attending a banquet at a private  club</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla asked for the location, thanked the woman curtly, and headed there without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hollowlyn Club was one of Trark&#39;s most exclusive venues</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the front desk, she introduced herself as a friend of Zoe&#39;s. The staff told her the private room number without question</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lavish interior spoke volumes; this was a place where the wealthy came to indulge</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Kayla reached the hallway leading to the private suite, she spotted Zoe just steps from the door</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zoe, don&#39;t take another step.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla closed the distance in a few long strides and yanked Zoe aside by the arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe, draped in an elegant evening gown and polished makeup, stood frozen in disbelief. &#34;Kayla? What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You showed up at the care facility yesterday, said God knows what, and left my grandmother so distressed she fell ill. This ends now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe curled her lips into a sneer. &#34;That&#39;s it? I thought  something serious had happened. Honestly, that old woman&#39;s been clinging to life for too long.Instead of wasting money on her, why not let her die peacefully at home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, Kayla struck her with a sharp slap across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slap sent Zoe reeling into the doorframe, her cheek flaring crimson in seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe shrieked, livid. &#34;You hit me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla flexed her wrist and scoffed.&#34;You earned it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe glared at her with hatred. &#34;You&#39;re just like your mother-vile and shameless. No wonder Dad left you If not for the two of you, Cooper Group would still be ours. You&#39;ve always been a curse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Kayla lifted her hand again, Zoe lunged for the door,shoved it open,and bolted inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice turned into a pitiful wail. &#34;Kayla,stop! Don&#39;t hit me again-we&#39;re family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla was caught off guard by her abrupt change in behavior but followed her into the room nonetheless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was taken aback when everyone inside turned their attention toward her. At the head of the table sat a man whose presence commanded attention-refined, magnetic, and radiating power. The moment their eyes met, Kayla&#39;s breath caught in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t expected to find Jeremy here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The table overflowed with elegantly prepared dishes,with Zoe and her mother, Amaya Cooper, seated close by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So they had come for Jeremy&#39;s banquet?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amaya looked startled as her eyes fell on Kayla Without hesitation,she pulled Zoe into her arms, her tone dripping with concern. &#34;Zoe, what happened,sweetheart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still in tears, Zoe stole a glance at the man at the table before she spoke in a voice thick with emotion.&#34;I saw Kayla in the hallway. She slapped me and accused me of hurting her grandmother. But I didn&#39;t do anything! She wouldn&#39;t even let me explain. I&#39;m so heartbroken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amaya turned to Kayla, feigning gentleness. &#34;Kayla, if something&#39;s wrong, we should talk things through.Violence never solves anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla took in the insincere show put on by Amaya and Zoe, her stomach turning with a sudden surge of  nausea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pregnancy had sharpened her senses, leaving her emotionally raw and physically fragile, and the heavy scent of food in the room only worsened her nausea.</p>
