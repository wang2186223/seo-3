                <p>Curiosity flickered in Kayla&#39;s eyes as she glanced Jeremy&#39;s way, eager to see how he&#39;d react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unmoved by Zoe&#39;s hopeful look, Jeremy gave no indication of interest-not even a glance in her direction, his eyes staying resolutely closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Awkwardness swept over Zoe as she scrambled for an explanation. &#34;Never mind. I guess we&#39;ve passed the worst of it. The air&#39;s not that bad now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet snort of laughter escaped Kayla before she clamped a hand over her mouth, trying to hide her amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the moment, Liam chimed in, &#34;If it&#39;s fine now,some fresh air wouldn&#39;t hurt at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one rushed to support Zoe, leaving her red-faced and fuming, her annoyance simmering just beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tiny smile tugged at Kayla&#39;s lips. Yet as she turned her head, her heart skipped-Jeremy was suddenly staring straight at her, his eyes cool and sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, she wiped the grin from her face, turning back to the window with forced nonchalance. Breaking the tension, Jeremy addressed the driver.&#34;There&#39;s no telling when traffic will clear up. Pull over for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had the car stopped than Zoe, still stewing,spotted a convenience store nearby. &#34;I want to grab a snack. Jeremy, will you wait here for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy said nothing, but his silence gave her all the permission she needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Zoe slipped out of the car,then paused to shoot Kayla an insistent look. &#34;Kayla,why don&#39;t you join me? Sitting here will just bore you to death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just didn&#39;t want to leave Kayla alone with Jeremy.Kayla&#39;s looks had always unsettled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla was eager for a little fresh air. The longer she stayed beside Jeremy, the more likely she was to slip up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, the vehicle held only Jeremy and Liam.The silence felt heavy, and Liam, sensing the tension,quickly excused himself to make a phone call,stepping outside for a cigarette and leaving Jeremy to his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without watching her step, Zoe barreled toward the convenience store, only to take a spectacular tumble. Trailing a few steps behind, Kayla stopped short. A moment later, she couldn&#39;t help but burst out laughing.&#34;Eager to kiss the pavement? Don&#39;t fall on your fake breasts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A furious glare was all Zoe gave Kayla as she scrambled to her feet, wincing. The fall had left her aching, and her once-elegant dress was now streaked with grime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearly stumbling again as she stood, Zoe reached out and steadied herself against a trash can. Glancing back,she found Kayla still giggling-a sight that only made her cheeks burn hotter. &#34;What, are you blind? You couldn&#39;t lift a finger to help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla simply clicked her tongue, her expression calm and unmoved. &#34;You landed on your own. Why would I step in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger flashed in Zoe&#39;s eyes. She clenched her fists,but catching sight of Jeremy&#39;s bodyguards watching nearby,she swallowed her retort and stormed into the store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside, Kayla grabbed a bottle of water, while Zoe snatched up a stack of tissues and scrubbed furiously at her soiled dress. At the counter, Zoe tossed in a pack of gum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take some. Maybe it&#39;ll keep your filthy mouth busy for once.&#34; Zoe shoved the pack at Kayla, popped a piece into her own mouth, and turned away, cheeks flushed with embarrassment and anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla could only stare, caught off guard by such childish pettiness. The dress now looked so ruined, it was almost comical. Zoe hurried back toward the motorcade,only to be met by Edwin&#39;s polite but firm blockade. &#34;Mr.Graham is particular about cleanliness. I&#39;m afraid your dress might dirty the seats.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flush crept over Zoe&#39;s face as she glanced down at the muddy fabric. &#34;I tripped earlier. I&#39;ll change as soon as we get home. Please, can&#39;t I just sit in the car?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin merely gestured toward a different vehicle.&#34;If you don&#39;t mind, the second car will be more suitable.Mr.Graham has a fetish about cleanliness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no choice, Zoe shuffled off to the car behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Kayla&#39;s phone buzzed with a work call. She stepped aside to take it, finished her conversation, and returned to the car without thinking twice. The instant she settled in, the car pulled away from the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only then that she realized she shared the vehicle wth just the driver-and Jeremy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where are Liam and Zoe?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, Kayla glanced out the window and noticed the convoy of cars trailing behind them. It dawned on her that Zoe and Liam must be in the second vehicle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she was lost in thought, Jeremy suddenly asked,&#34;Where is your ring-the one Zane gave you?&#34;</p>
